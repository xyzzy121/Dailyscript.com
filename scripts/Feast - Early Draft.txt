               FADE IN:

               EXT. DESERT -- DAY

               The white sun beats down on the rocky terrain. There's not a 
               cloud in the blue sky and the wind is at a standstill.

               Far in the distance, a LINE OF PEOPLE make their way towards 
               the entrance of a small cavern.

               Two VULTURES perched on barren tree watch the intruders.

               EXT. CAVERN ENTRANCE -- MOMENTS LATER

               A tall, lean, effeminate man with oversized glasses and 
               wearing a tight brown uniform stands in front of the cavern 
               entrance. He wears a tan bandanna around his neck and uses a 
               water-filled spray bottle to cool himself down.

               This is the MALE BROWNIE TROOP LEADER (36).

                                     TROOP LEADER
                              (with a lisp)
                         Okay ladies, gather around!

               A DOZEN YOUNG GIRLS dressed in BROWNIE UNIFORMS stand in 
               front of the Troop Leader. They've been walking for half the 
               day and couldn't care less what adventure awaits.

               He produces a small hand chisel.

                                     TROOP LEADER
                         This is the type of chisel that we 
                         will all be using today. It is not 
                         to be used for "hitting" things, it 
                         is to be used for "chiseling" 
                         things... gently.

               He demonstrates, chiseling the air.

                                     TROOP LEADER
                         And does anyone know why we don't 
                         want to hit things?

               The girls sigh, they've been through this type of treatment 
               from him a thousand times before.

                                     BROWNIE GROUP
                         Because we don't want to break the 
                         dinosaur bones.

                                     TROOP LEADER
                         Correct! Now, let's get to it and 
                         earn those anthropology badges!

               The Troop Leader turns to enter the cavern. The group follows.

               A SICKLY BROWNIE tries to hide from the others, but the Troop 
               Leader notices her. He shakes his head and corners her.

                                     TROOP LEADER
                              (kneeling)
                         Hey little bear, aren't you going to 
                         join the others?

                                     SICKLY BROWNIE
                         Um, my allergist told me not to engage 
                         in physically demanding activities 
                         where ragweed or spores might be 
                         present, sir.

               The Troop Leader frowns, but knows what to do.

                                     TROOP LEADER
                         Do you have a note to corroborate 
                         these claims?

                                     SICKLY BROWNIE
                         Um, well...

                                     TROOP LEADER
                         Are you lying to me?

                                     SICKLY BROWNIE
                         Well...

                                     TROOP LEADER
                         What did we say about lying?

                                     SICKLY BROWNIE
                         I'm not lying.

                                     TROOP LEADER
                         You know that no one likes a liar, 
                         right?

                                     SICKLY BROWNIE
                         I said I'm not lying.

               The Troop Leader tilts his head, unsure.

                                     TROOP LEADER
                         Well, let's just say this... You 
                         don't have to join your troop if 
                         your claim of sickness is genuine, 
                         however if you are lying, someone 
                         will always know...

               Troop Leader points up to God.

                                     TROOP LEADER
                         And remember what happens to a liar's 
                         soul when they die? It burns in 
                         hell... for eternity.

               The Troop Leader nods his head and rises, pointing to the 
               sky once again.

               Sickly Brownie doesn't waver, she's not going in that cavern.

                                     TROOP LEADER
                         ...and you don't get the badge.

               Sickly Brownie's eyes widen. She follows the Troop Leader.

               INT. CAVERN -- MOMENTS LATER

               A string of lights at the top of the cavern provide the only 
               light. Each Brownie lightly chisels at the rock walls, looking 
               for anything.

               The Troop Leader wears a hard hat with a flashlight mounted 
               on the top.

                                     TROOP LEADER
                         Not so hard girls, slow and steady 
                         is how Troop Daddy likes it.

               The Sickly Brownie is deep in the cavern, gently chiseling 
               at a wall. She looks back at the Troop Leader and WHACKS the 
               wall...

               CRUSH... the rock wall crumbles and a SMALL HOLE remains.

               The Troop Leader notices and rushes over to investigate.

                                     TROOP LEADER
                         What have you done now, broke the 
                         darn thing?

                                     SICKLY BROWNIE
                              (covering)
                         I just hit it like you said.

               The Troop Leader moves closer to the hole.

                                     TROOP LEADER
                         Yeah, right. Let me see there...

               Troop Leader chisels at the surface surrounding the hole.

               It crumbles away and he accidentally DROPS his chisel in.

                                     TROOP LEADER
                         Whoops!

               SNOTTY BROWNIE comes over.

                                     SNOTTY BROWNIE
                         What is it?

               He shines his light into the tiny breach. There's a moment 
               of silence and then... a distant PING, like the chisel fell 
               hundreds of feet.

                                     TROOP LEADER
                         It's deep. That's weird, maybe it's 
                         a hidden cavern, with an old cowboy's 
                         stash!
                              (animated to group)
                         Listen up ladies, we may have found 
                         a secret treasure! Who wants to be 
                         rich!?

               He laughs to himself and puts his face up to the hole for a 
               closer look.

                                     TROOP LEADER
                         Wow! I see something shiny --

               CHOMP! A set of giant, ravenous teeth bite into the Troop 
               Leader's skull. Blood SPLATTERS on Sickly Brownie.

               His body is YANKED into the hole.

               The Brownies SCREAM and turn to RUN. Sickly Brownie is scared 
               stiff. CRASH! The wall collapses as a WHITE BLUR bursts 
               through and knocks over Sickly Brownie.

               CHOMP! CHOMP! CHOMP! With blazing speed, the white blur 
               attacks the running Brownies. Shadows, ripping, tearing, 
               howling, fills the cavern.

               Sickly Brownie struggles to her feet and staggers for the 
               exit. Her fellow Troops are yanked into the darkness from 
               all directions.

               SNOTTY BROWNIE, now with NO ARMS, falls in front of Sickly 
               Brownie. Sickly trips, landing face first in a puddle of 
               blood and guts.

               Gagging and wheezing, Sickly Brownie makes one last sprint 
               for the mouth of the cave. Behind her, the white blur WAILS 
               as it snaps the bones of dying children.

               Sickly Brownie is almost to the exit. She can feel the sun's 
               heat on her flush cheeks. She's almost there. She's gonna 
               make it. Only a few more feet. And then... JERK!

               A white furry arm grabs her neck and YANKS her back into the 
               darkness.

               The whiplash sends her bloody WHEEZER flying into the light...

               EXT. BAR -- NIGHT

               We focus on a neon sign on top of a bar named UNITED NATIONS 
               TAVERN. We can hear talking and laughing from inside.

               A 1985, pristine black Pontiac Trans-Am with a Golden Eagle 
               on the hood pulls up. We follow it around to the back parking 
               lot. The rear bumper sticker reads "MY OTHER TOY HAS TITS."

               A weasel-like man with a fat belly and tank-top emerges from 
               the hot rod. We freeze on him.

               We follow him as he lazily makes his way to the front entrance 
               of the bar.

               ON THE SIDE OF THE BAR, he tosses an empty bottle of WILD 
               TURKEY.

               We pan away to see the layout of the back parking lot and 
               surrounding area:

               Cars and pick-up trucks are scattered throughout the parking 
               lot. There is a BEER TRUCK backed up to a long aluminum tunnel 
               that leads to the back of the bar. A BEER DELIVERY GUY pulls 
               a keg from the beer truck and lugs it into the tunnel.

               Snow lightly falls. The swift wind causes snow drifts to 
               form on the outer edges of the parking lot. We turn back to 
               pick up Bozo as he turns the corner to the front of the bar 
               and pushes through the front doors.

               INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               The place is dark, musty and sporadically populated. We take 
               a quick right and stop at an old-fashioned jukebox.

               A young man in a wheelchair loads a quarter into the jukebox 
               and is instantly pushed away by Bozo. We freeze on the young 
               man.

                         song. She's gone, the car's broke 
                         down, a father figure made a pass at 
                         me. I have a constant fear of 
                         falling... etcetera, etcetera. I'm 
                         not saying I ever had it. But I have 
                         definitely lost it.

               Tuffy's stride eases into SLOW MOTION:

               We can SEE THROUGH the closed locket -- it conceals a PICTURE 
               of a smiling, young boy. It is Tuffy's son, CODY.

               Beer Guy pulls the keg from the little elevator and places 
               it next to the many other kegs in the basement.

               He HEARS a faint conversation behind a curtain.

               It is between BOSS MAN (paunchy, sweaty, ugly) and ROADIE

               Beer Guy hesitantly moves toward the conversation. A RED

               and Boss Man.

                                     BOZO
                         How much for the whole night, Grandma?

                                     GRANDMA
                              (disgusted)
                         You should be so lucky.

               Grandpa raises his fists one at a time as he explains...

                                     GRANDPA
                         This one will just stun ya, but this 
                         one will put ya to sleep.

                                     BOZO
                              (mocking)
                         Whoa!

               We follow Bozo as he takes notice of OLD VET (52, long hair 
               with bandanna, dirty beard) HARLEY MOM, (45, bruiser, 
               grizzled, tough as a saddle) and DRUNK GUY. He saddles up 
               next to them at the bar.

                                     BOZO
                         You boys wanna take a try at the 
                         loot?

               They don't respond. Harley Mom is offended.

                                     BOZO
                         Come on, I'll even throw with my 
                         left hand.

               He turns in disappointment.

               Goldie downs another shot. The tart sting of the drink hits 
               him. He slaps the bar.

                                     GOLDIE
                         Ooohhh!

                                     BOZO
                              (addressing room)
                         Nothin' but a bunch of butts and 
                         pussies in here!

               EXT. PRAIRIE LAND -- NIGHT

               P.O.V. - We are frantically running. The bar is just a 
               quarter mile ahead. We leap a fence and --

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

               KRASH! Belle DROPS a tray full of drinks behind the bar.

                                     BELLE
                         Shit! Shit! Shit!

               Bartender helps her.

                                     BARTENDER
                         Don't sweat it, just clean it up 
                         before he's done.

               He points up and we rapidly RISE to the second floor.

               ON SECOND FLOOR

               Tuffy's son CODY (7, innocent, cute) sits on the floor 
               watching TV.

               SUPERIMPOSED

               NAME: CODY 
               AGE: 7 
               OCCUPATION: DEPENDENT 
               LIFE EXPECTANCY: A WONDERFUL, FULL LIFE

               Tuffy walks over to him and puts HEADPHONES over his ears.

                                     TUFFY
                         Keep these on, sweetheart.

                                     CODY
                         Okay, mommy.

               Tuffy kisses him on the head and then moves to an adjacent 
               room.

               ADJACENT ROOM

               Tuffy enters the room and takes off her blouse exposing her 
               breasts. She pulls up her skirt and bends over a bedpost.

                                     TUFFY
                         Let's get this over with.

               Boss Man walks up behind her, naked, except for Red Cowboy 
               Boots.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         I love a woman with enthusiasm.

               EXT. BAR FRONT -- NIGHT

               P.O.V. - We move in fast on the bar --

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

               Bozo walks to the middle of the room, proudly displaying his 
               prize money.

                                     BOZO
                         I got two hundred bucks says none of 
                         you can beat me!

               The bar is silent. Bartender points to the double doors.

                                     BARTENDER
                         Hey! Get quiet or get out.

                                     BOZO
                              (grinning)
                         C'mon guys--

               EXT. BAR -- NIGHT

               P.O.V. - Hurtling toward the double doors and --

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

                                     BOZO
                         Gimme some ACTION --

               BOOM! The double doors to the bar are kicked open by HERO 
               (rugged alpha man with dark features and built to kick ass).

               KRASH! Belle DROPS a second tray of drinks--

               MUSIC CUTS OUT

               Hero is scraped, bruised and bloodied. He is dressed in blue 
               denim, with a hand made duct tape and leather neck guard. He 
               holds a RUST-RED SHOTGUN and a GUNNY SACK. He SLAMS the double 
               doors shut and props a chair against the handles, securing 
               them.

               Hero spins around and cocks his weapon.

               He has the bar's attention.

                                     HERO
                         Unless you people want to die you'll 
                         do what I say and you'll do it fast!

               KAH-CHUCK! Bartender cocks his SHOTGUN.

                                     BARTENDER
                         You hold it right there, mister.

               Hero raises his one hand holding the gunny sack.

                                     HERO
                              (catching his breath.)
                         A storm of hell's coming down on 
                         this place any minute!

                                     BARTENDER
                         Drop the canon!

               Hero puts down the shotgun and cautiously moves towards 
               Bartender.

                                     HERO
                         I'm not armed now, just hear me out.

               Hero gets closer.

                                     BARTENDER
                         I'll drop you and not even think 
                         about it!

                                     HERO
                         Let me explain!

                                     BARTENDER
                         YOU GOT ONE SECOND TO --

               WHOOSH! Hero reveals a drool-dripping, white, GRANDPAPA BEAST 
               HEAD from the gunny sack and holds it out and high for all 
               to see.

                                     HERO
                         LISTEN TO ME!

               The bar GASPS.

                                     HERO
                         Take a good look! There's at least a 
                         FOUR of these things out there!

               Grandpapa Beast's head has softball-sized eyeballs and a 
               seven by seven inch mouth full of jagged, ivory white teeth. 
               It is like a super-sized, albino, jackal head with long, 
               stringy hair.

                                     HERO
                         I saw one of them tear up five men 
                         like they were corn on the cob!

               The bar is silent.

                                     HERO
                         I don't know what they are. I don't 
                         know where they came from. All I do 
                         know is that these fuckers are fast, 
                         nasty, and hungry.

               The bar stares at him, slack-jawed.

                                     HERO
                         ...And they can fly. Not to mention 
                         they're damn-shitfuckin' near 
                         impervious to conventional firepower.

               The shocked Bartender lowers his shotgun slightly.

               WHIP! Hero drops the head on the bar and GRABS the shotgun 
               from Bartender's hands.

               Hero notices an ENGRAVING on the shotgun. It has "THE JUDGE" 
               carved into the handle. He nods approvingly to Bartender.

                                     HERO
                         Now these things are coming. RIGHT 
                         NOW. We have to lock this bar down!

               He moves and points to vulnerable areas.

                                     HERO
                         That means doors, windows, drains, 
                         basements, skylights, whatever, and 
                         we have to do it fast!

               Hero runs to the lone window in the front of the bar and 
               then back at the patrons.

                                     HERO
                              (addressing Belle)
                         You! Get on that phone. Call the 
                         cops, the National Guard, townies, 
                         whoever kicks ass and get 'em out 
                         here.

               Belle moves to a pay phone at the end of the bar. She 
               nervously grabs for coins in her apron.

                                     HERO
                              (addressing patrons)
                         We gotta seal off the back, seal off 
                         the top and lock down the bottom.
                              (Beat)
                         Any questions?

               Everyone is silent.

                                     BARTENDER
                         Who are you?

                                     HERO
                         I'm the hero --

               CRASH! Two white Beast arms BURST through the window and 
               SPLIT Hero right down the middle.

               BLAM! The Judge fires into the ceiling --

               SECOND FLOOR

               BLAM! The Judge's blast blows through the Boss Man's RIGHT 
               FOOT as he reaches climax with Tuffy. Boss Man hollers.

               Tuffy SCREAMS --

               MAIN BAR

               Hero's right half is JERKED outside through the window!

               Belle SCREAMS into the phone!

               The bar screams in horror! Blood sprays! Rapid chomping!

               NOTE: The full Beasts are all white and furiously fly around 
               like bolts of lightning. They emit a high shrill sound, like 
               a buzz saw working a piece of steel.

               The patrons scramble.

               CRASH! The double doors are kicked open, splintering the 
               propped up chair. The people duck for cover.

               HEROINE (Native American, rugged, ripped pants, wickedly 
               hot) rushes in, slams the doors shut and instinctively kicks 
               up the RUST RED SHOTGUN. She flips it sideways and slides 
               the metal weapon through the handles of the double doors, 
               securing them.

               BAM! A massive HIT slams into the doors from the outside 
               sending Heroine SLIDING across the floor.

               She SPRINGS to her feet and drives her weight into a table 
               attempting to hoist it over the now open window.

                                     HEROINE
                         HELP ME! SOMEBODY!

               Old Vet and Harley Mom rush to Heroine's aid. They raise the 
               table to cover the gaping hole. Heroine looks outside.

                                     HEROINE
                         GET DOWN!

               A BEAST nails the rising table, just missing Heroine's face.

               The table falls, pinning Heroine. A BEAST enters.

               This is JUNIOR BEAST. He's all white and fast like the others, 
               but small, the size of a 9 year-old child. He uses speed and 
               his long sharp claws to cause havoc.

               CHUCK! CHUCK! JUNIOR swipes the heads off Old Vet and Harley 
               Mom. Their heads BOUNCE off the wall and drop.

               Good Guy shields Good Girl in a booth as Adulterer and Trampy 
               hit the deck.

               Junior Beast tears through the bar, shrieking. It BANGS the 
               jukebox and an 80's punk-hit plays.

               Heroine pulls herself out from under the table.

               Goldie jerks backward off his stool and hits the floor.  
               Junior Beast SCRATCHES Bartender's back and he falls near 
               The Judge.

               Junior Beast KNOCKS beer taps off the bar set one by one, 
               leaps over the bar, swings its claws at a ducking Belle, 
               then kick-rips the pay phone from the wall. SPARKS spit out.

               JUNIOR BEAST continues his tour as he destroys the TV.

               It sweeps down and pulls out half of Trampy's hair. She 
               bellows. It throws a booth at Beer Guy. He dives out of the 
               way. Items fly off of the walls and tables.

               The Elderly couple crouch, holding each other tight.

               Bartender scrambles for The Judge on the floor.

               Junior Beast's body BANGS the jukebox again, the song SKIPS.

               It rises to the ceiling for another attack.

               Para ducks as lethal talons rip his back rest.

               Junior Beast jumps and BREAKS a ceiling fan.

               Drunk Guy CHARGES the spastic monster with a stool.

                                     DRUNK GUY
                         GET 'EM!

               SWIPE! Drunk Guy misses the creature.

                                     DRUNK GUY
                         NOOOO!

               The wild Beast scoops up Drunk Guy. He is sent FLYING into a 
               wall.

                                     HEROINE
                         Close that window!

               BLAM! BLAM! Bartender FIRES The Judge at the creature hitting 
               lights and the walls. Drunk Guy rolls upright.

               BLAM! A shot DESTROYS Drunk Guy's face.

               Junior Beast's body BANGS the jukebox again. The song STOPS.

               Beer Guy WHACKS Junior Beast with a chair. Stunned, it flies 
               across the air, landing in a tall, metal ICE COOLER.

               Bozo SLAMS it closed, capturing Junior Beast.

                                     BOZO
                         Got 'cha!

                                     HEROINE
                         HOLD THAT TIGHT!

               Bozo struggles to keep the lid shut.

                                     BOZO
                         Hot damn!

               EXT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               THREE MORE FLYING BEASTS close in on the window, shrieking...

               INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               Bartender runs across the bar and SLAMS shut the thick wood 
               shutters over the window.

               The Beasts HIT. The shutters crack down the middle.

               ANGLE ON

               Roadie POWER LIFTS the table with Heroine and braces it 
               against the window for reinforcement but --

               POP! A FURRY ARM busts through the shutters and reaches 
               around, outside the edge of the bracing table and grabs the 
               other half of Hero.

                                     HEROINE
                         God damn you!

               Heroine grabs Hero's remaining hand and is jerked to the 
               wall. Roadie shoves the table with all of his might against 
               the intruding arm.

               Blood starts to SPRAY from outside as the rest of Hero is 
               being devoured through the smallish hole. Heroine is being 
               showered by the gore as she works a GOLD RING off of Hero's 
               ring finger.

               The feeding Beast's head breaks in through the hole. It grabs 
               Heroine's left forearm.

               Bartender aims The Judge at the Beast...

                                     ROADIE
                         You'll hit her!

               Roadie KNOCKS The Judge up -- BLAM!

               SECOND FLOOR

               The Judge's shotgun blast blows through Boss Man's RIGHT 
               FOOT again! He cries out in agony.

               Tuffy grabs the floor.

               MAIN BAR

               The attacking Beast's mouth opens to feed on Heroine.

               Heroine frantically grabs a SPLINTERED PIECE of the broken 
               chair and buries it into the BEAST'S RIGHT EYE.

               The Beast SCREECHES and jerks back, scratching Heroine's arm 
               and dragging the rest of Hero outside.

               Heroine has the ring. She kicks away from the wall to the 
               center of the bar's floor.

               Shrieks and flapping wings are heard outside.

               They dissipate.

               A moment of calm.

               Belle timidly looks up from behind the bar, shaking, with 
               pretzels in her hair. She holds the receiver of the busted 
               pay phone.

               The other patrons emerge from under tables and other hiding 
               spaces in various states of shock.

               The Judge's barrel smolders.

               Roadie breathes heavily against the table.

               Goldie sits up, shocked sober.

               Good Guy cautiously lowers Good Girl's hands from her face.

               Junior Beast has momentarily stopped moving. Bozo secures 
               the lid with a nearby PADLOCK.

                                     BOZO
                         What the FUCK is that?

               Heroine rolls back and flips upright, wild-eyed. She looks 
               at the blood soaked bar.

               The patrons eye the ice cooler in morbid curiosity.

               Bartender eases toward Heroine pointing The Judge at the 
               breached face of the bar.

               Heroine pants with adrenaline. We freeze on her.

               She reaches in her pocket, pulls out a couple dollars and 
               SLAMS them on the bar.

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

               There is a HOLLER at the top of the stairs. Everyone turns.

                                     BOSS MAN
                              (PANICKED)
                         IS IT CLEAR?!

                                     BARTENDER
                         Yeah.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         IS THERE A GUN POINTING AT YOU?

                                     BARTENDER
                         Nah, I got the gun.

               Boss Man hobbles down the stairs with the help of Tuffy.

               His foot is a bloody mess. He is holding a .38.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         All right god damn it! Who shot me!? 
                         Who did it!?

               Tuffy helps him. Belle and Bartender move to his aid.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         My god damn foot is gone! Who fuckin' 
                         shot me? Who fuckin' shot me!?

                                     BARTENDER
                              (motioning to Heroine)
                         Her fella.

                                     HEROINE
                              (weary)
                         My husband...

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Well, where's the sonuvabitch!?

                                     HEROINE
                         He's dead.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         What?

               Boss Man and Tuffy notice the destruction to the bar.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         What the hell happened down here?!

               Boss Man looks to Bozo.

                                     BOZO
                         I didn't do it! It was fuckin' 
                         monsters, asshole!

               Boss Man cocks the .38.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Jesus Christ on the cross... Someone 
                         make sense.

                                     HEROINE
                         Easy. We're surrounded by something 
                         the likes none of you have ever seen 
                         before. Some kind of animals. Real 
                         fast, volatile, predators. ONE went 
                         through three of your patrons like 
                         they were Kleenex.

                                     BOSS MAN
                              (matter of fact)
                         So, your dead hubby shot me twice, 
                         three of my customers have been eaten, 
                         and there are angry creatures outside?

                                     HEROINE
                         He only shot you once.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Huh?

                                     HEROINE
                              (re: Bartender)
                         He shot you the other time.

                                     BARTENDER
                         It was an accident. Sorry.

               Boss Man squints skeptically. Good Guy points to the bar.

                                     GOOD GUY
                         Look at it!

               Good Guy directs the attention of Boss Man and Tuffy to 
               GRANDPAPA BEAST'S HEAD at the end of the bar.

                                     BOSS MAN
                              (accepting)
                         Fan-fuckin-tastic.

               Tuffy, still supporting Boss Man, is mesmerized by the head 
               and damage to the bar.

                                     TUFFY
                         Oh my God... What is that?

                                     HEROINE
                         That's one piece of four problems.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Please elaborate.

               Tight on Heroine's eyes.

                                     HEROINE
                         That head over there?

               She points to the decapitated beast head.

                                     HEROINE
                         That's the oldest of the bunch, looked 
                         like the Grandpapa. We caught the 
                         little one, Junior, in the cooler 
                         there. As we've seen, what he lacks 
                         in size he more than makes up for in 
                         speed.

                                     BARTENDER
                         And the rest of 'em?

                                     HEROINE
                         Unfortunately, the worst of 'em are 
                         still outside.

               Heroine spins and recalls the gory details...

               NOTE: As Heroine describes each beast, we see a glimpse of 
               their virtues.

                                     HEROINE
                         The next one is taller, but all out 
                         of proportion. Like a "teen beast."

               EXT. PRAIRIE LAND -- NIGHT

               Just a quick glimpse of TEEN BEAST. He's got a big head and 
               awkward body. He clumsily moves and seems uncomfortable in 
               his own skin. He's got big balls and can't keep his hands 
               off of them.

                                     HEROINE (V.O.)
                         He was spastic, clumsy, but deadly 
                         just the same.

               INT. BAR FRONT -- NIGHT

               Heroine tends to her scratched arm.

                                     HEROINE
                         If I'm not mistaken, I just took the 
                         eye out of the Mother. She can guide 
                         the attacks. She calculates.

               EXT. PRAIRIE LAND -- NIGHT

               MOMMA BEAST flashes out from the dark. She's shorter than 
               Teen, but much wider. She has a big mouth and NATIONAL 
               GEOGRAPHIC BOOBS that hang down to her waist. She covers her 
               stabbed left eye and SCREECHES.

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

               Heroine taps her left eye.

                                     HEROINE
                         If you are face to face with her, 
                         dive left.

                                     ROADIE
                         And the last one is the...

                                     HEROINE
                         Father. The biggest, the strongest...

               EXT. PRAIRIE LAND -- NIGHT

               FLASH! We only see a blur of muscles, bloody fur, and teeth.

               INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               The entire bar stares at Heroine with their mouths on the 
               floor.

                                     HEROINE
                         No sign of any weaknesses. No sign 
                         at all. He's an eating machine.

               Goldie puts his head down.

                                     GOLDIE
                              (sotto)
                         Of all the friggin' bars to go into...

               The bar folks back up, not so confident about their chances.

                                     HEROINE
                         All right, we need to lock this place 
                         down! Everyone in this room?

               Tuffy eyes bug. She drops Boss Man's arm. He topples.

                                     TUFFY
                         Oh my god! My son! My SON!

               We race with Tuffy toward the staircase to the SECOND FLOOR.

                                     HEROINE
                         Wait!

               Heroine and Bartender give chase.

               Tuffy is halfway up the stairs.

                                     TUFFY
                         Cody! Cody are you all right? Mommy's 
                         coming! Mommy's coming, baby! Don't 
                         move! Mommy's coming!

                                     HEROINE
                         Stop her!

                                     BARTENDER
                         Hey!

               ON SECOND FLOOR

               Tuffy BURSTS through the door.

               Cody stands by the TV fiddling with the switches. Heroine 
               and Bartender halt to guard the doorway. Heroine watches a 
               PORTAL WINDOW between the doorway and Tuffy's son by the TV.

                                     CODY
                         Mommy, the TV doesn't work.

               Tuffy picks up Cody and holds him in her arms. Heroine waves 
               Tuffy and her son toward the door.

                                     HEROINE
                              (hushed)
                         Careful! C'mon!

               Tuffy cautiously shuffles back toward the doorway.

                                     TUFFY
                         Oh sweetheart! What was I thinking? 
                         Mommy is never gonna let you go. Oh 
                         Jesus... Never, ever, never let you 
                         go.

                                     HEROINE
                              (tense, to Bartender)
                         Let's lock off this room.

               Tuffy and Cody move to exit.

                                     TUFFY
                         Okay, baby? Never, ever, never. Never, 
                         ever, never, baby. Just stay close. 
                         I am never gonna let go. I love you, 
                         love you, lo --

               SMASH! Papa Beast BURSTS through the portal window and RIPS 
               Cody's torso from Tuffy's grasp!

               Tuffy holds his DANGLING ARMS! Blood SPRAYS everywhere!

                                     TUFFY
                         NOOOOOOOO!

               RAAR! Papa Beast LUNGES at Tuffy!

                                     HEROINE
                         Shoot him!!!

               BLAM! Bartender shoots, nailing Papa Beast in the side.

               He hisses, but can't fit through the small window.

               Bartender aims to shoot...

               BLAP! Papa Beast projectile vomits Cody's skull and the 
               remains of past meals at Bartender's chest... the shotgun 
               drops and Bartender stumbles back.

               Papa Beast retracts out the portal window.

               Heroine SLAMS the wood shutters closed.

               Tuffy drops Cody's arms. She is bug-eyed. She walks, zombie-
               like, to the staircase.

               Bartender stands dazed, covered in Papa Beast's bile. He 
               wipes his face, picks up the Judge, and follows.

               Heroine locks the staircase door shut. She rubs a gold locket 
               around her neck.

                                     HEROINE
                         Dammit.

               Heroine drops her head and moves down the stairs.

               We follow her into the main room where the shocked group 
               waits.

               Beer Guy stares at the bile covered Bartender.

                                     BEER GUY
                         Oh my god...

               Hands him a towel.

               Tuffy slowly walks toward the rest of the patrons. The blood 
               on her face and chest tells them what happened.

               The horror hits home.

               Good Guy holds Good Girl close.

               Bozo bows his head. Adulterer wipes his brow.

               Goldie downs another shot. Heroine eyes the destroyed phone.

                                     HEROINE
                         Is that the only phone?

               Bartender emerges from the back holding a mess of plastic 
               and wires.

                                     BARTENDER
                         The back phone is wrecked too.

               Adulterer is listening intently. Rubbing his chin. Good Girl's 
               eye's light up and she digs through her purse.

               Tuffy sits in a booth, shut down.

                                     GOOD GIRL
                         This is really happening. I can't 
                         believe this is really happening.

               Good Guy takes Good Girl's head to his lips.

                                     GOOD GUY
                         We'll be fine. We're gonna be just 
                         fine.

               Grandpa and Grandma have calmly re-taken their seats and are 
               sipping their drinks.

                                     GRANDPA
                         What'd you say?

                                     GRANDMA
                         I didn't say anything.

               Bartender hesitantly tosses a wash towel over the Grandpa 
               Beast head at the end of the bar. Goldie opens a fresh bottle 
               of something stiff and takes a generous swig.

               Para is slumped holding his dripping hand.

               Belle moves over to aid Para with a rag.

                                     PARA
                         Thank you.

                                     BELLE
                         Are you okay? Do you need something 
                         for your hand?

                                     PARA
                         No, it doesn't hurt.

               Para flexes the dart-wounded hand.

                                     PARA
                         The nerve endings are shot, can't 
                         feel a thing.

                                     BELLE
                         That's a pretty good scam.

                                     PARA
                         Pays more than the couch.

               Good Girl pulls out a CELLULAR PHONE from her purse.

                                     GOOD GIRL
                         Here!

               The group looks over. Adulterer GRABS it.

                                     GOOD GUY
                         Hey!

               Adulterer starts dialing.

                                     ADULTERER
                         Back off!

               Beer Guy walks from behind the bar.

                                     BEER GUY
                         So, what now? Did those things leave?

                                     BOZO
                         Why don't you go check it out?

                                     BEER GUY
                         Fuck no.

                                     ADULTERER
                              (to off-screen wife)
                         I have a signal! I have... Diane? 
                         Diane listen to me... get the kids 
                         and get in the basement... do it 
                         right now...

               Trampy is teary-eyed staring at her folded hands. Heroine 
               notices.

                                     ADULTERER
                              (flustered)
                         Diane don't do this now. I'll explain 
                         later. Not now! We can... I'm at a 
                         bar... look... shut up! JUST SHUT UP 
                         AND GET IN THE FUCKING BASEMENT, 
                         DIANE! Diane! Diane?... Hello? Dammit! 
                         I lost the signal!

               Adulterer gets up, a bit dazed.

                                     ADULTERER
                              (growing in intensity)
                         Okay. Okay. Look now, I gotta get 
                         outta here! I gotta go! My wife... 
                         See my wife is alone... I gotta go! 
                         She could be in trouble. I GOTTA GO!

               He backs up and moves towards the front door. Heroine shuffles 
               into his path, hands raised.

                                     HEROINE
                         I wouldn't do that.

               Adulterer, violently grabs Heroine to shove her away.

                                     ADULTERER
                         Fuck you, bitch!

               WHAM! WHAM! BAM! Heroine nails Adulterer with THREE HITS to 
               the chin, throat and chest.

               Heroine takes him by the forearm and FLIPS him to the floor.  
               Heroine pulls a KNIFE from her belt buckle and has it under 
               Adulterer's chin.

                                     HEROINE
                         YOU CAN RISK YOUR LIFE, BUT NOT MINE! 
                         YOU PULL THAT TOUGH BOY SHIT ONE 
                         MORE TIME AND I'LL SLICE YOU FROM 
                         NECK TO NUTS!

               Bartender aims The Judge.

                                     ROADIE
                         I'd listen to her if I were you.

               Adulterer nods obediently. Heroine removes the knife from 
               his neck and plants it back into her buckle.

               Adulterer slowly rolls upright, beaten.

                                     ADULTERER
                              (re: Bartender, 
                              catching breath)
                         You willing to shoot me?

                                     BARTENDER
                         If it keeps us alive.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Save your energy for a real problem.

               Adulterer moves from the door.

                                     ADULTERER
                              (to bar)
                         You can't keep me here. This is 
                         bullshit. Fuckin' bullshit. This is 
                         fucking BULLSHIT!

                                     HEROINE
                         We can't risk letting them in.

                                     ADULTERER
                              (trembling, pissed)
                         Right.

               Heroine kicks loose a metal footrest pole.

               The Bartender sets down the Judge to clean his face and arms 
               in the sink.

                                     BARTENDER
                              (sotto)
                         This shit burns.

               Good Guy approaches Adulterer and touches his arm.

                                     GOOD GUY
                         Just take a seat.

                                     ADULTERER
                         Don't touch me!

               Adulterer takes his seat. He looks over at the half bald 
               Trampy. She looks at him, hurt.

               He covers his face in shame. Good Guy takes the phone back.

               Heroine slides the thick metal pole through the double door 
               handles. The slide sends the Rust Red shotgun back into her 
               hands. She turns and cocks the weapon.

               BAM! BAM! BAM! Junior Beast bangs around in the ice cooler, 
               doing himself more damage than good.

                                     BOZO
                         I think it's hungry again.

               Heroine moves close, her gun raised.

                                     HEROINE
                         We have to kill it.
                              (to Boss Man)
                         Can you help?

               Boss Man aims his .38.

               Like he knows what is coming, Junior Beast goes wild, trying 
               to get out.

                                     HEROINE
                         Fire!

               BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! Bullets rip through the cooler.

               Junior squeals. More shots. Casings hit the ground.

               Smoke rises. Boss Man's .38 is empty.

               Bozo is the first to lean in.

                                     BOZO
                         I think we got --

               RAH! A tiny white arm fires out from the cooler grabbing 
               Bozo's leg. Bozo yelps. Junior shrieks.

               Tuffy shoves The Judge into a hole and...

               BLAM! Guts splatter. Junior's greenish-blood drips out of 
               the many holes.

               Bozo falls back unscathed. He catches his breath and looks 
               to Tuffy. She is born again, hard.

                                     TUFFY
                         You're welcome.

                                     GOOD GIRL
                         Jesus, it took all that? All those 
                         bullets? How can we possibly fight 
                         off the others?

                                     ROADIE
                         We'll think of somethin'.

                                     GOOD GUY
                         Maybe we don't have to fight them.

                                     BOZO
                         What you wanna do, call 'em names?

               Everyone is waiting for a little more.

                                     GOOD GUY
                         No, scare them. Scare them right 
                         back. This is a species stand-off. 
                         We just need to show them we're not 
                         vulnerable. That we're formidable.

                                     ADULTERER
                         How?

                                     GOOD GUY
                         I need a stick.

               Bartender opens the cooler's lid and carefully pulls out 
               Junior Beast with salad tongs. The carcass falls to the floor 
               with a SPLAT.

               Beer Guy hands Good Guy a splintered broomstick.

                                     GOOD GUY
                         Stand back.

               He buries the broomstick into Junior's side and carries the 
               limp carcass towards a covered hole in the wall.

                                     GOOD GUY
                         Let's get that board down.

               Roadie pries off a board to reveal a pumpkin sized hole.

                                     HEROINE
                         What the hell you doing?

               Good Guy shoves Junior's mangled body through to the outside.

                                     GOOD GUY
                         Showing superiority. The scent of 
                         their dead may drive them away.

               The whole bar moves to the side wall to see how the Beast 
               Family will react.

                                     GOOD GUY
                         Come on. Come onnnnnn.

                                     GOOD GIRL
                         Is there a call, or something?

               Bozo leans forward.

                                     BOZO
                         See that you monkey fucks! That's 
                         what you get when you mess with us! 
                         Woman or man, I don't give a fuck! 
                         Shit don't make me gay, you'll be 
                         sucking my dick!

               Bozo's last insult hangs in the air. Good Guy stares at him.

                                     PARA
                         Nice...

               EXT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               WHOOSH! Junior is swiped from the hand made pike.

               INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               Good Guy jerks back. The startled group refocuses as the 
               Father Beast perches under the moonlight before them cradling 
               his dead child.

               The other Beast Family members slowly approach Junior. For 
               the first time, the others in the bar get to see what they're 
               up against. And just as Heroine said, they're an odd mix of 
               white fur, teeth and claws.

               Papa Beast is gentle and it's almost endearing. Teen Beast 
               Bows his misshapen head. Momma Beast takes Junior in her 
               arms and nuzzles him.

                                     GOOD GIRL
                         It's working. I think it's working.

               INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               The whole group starts to ease.

               Then... Papa Beast HOLLERS.

               EXT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               From deep in his soul, Papa Beast lets out a HORRID WAIL.  
               If there were anyone alive for miles around, they'd be able 
               to hear him.

               The group covers their ears.

               Then, something really odd happens. Momma tosses Junior in 
               the air, opens her wide jaws, and SWALLOWS HIM WHOLE.

               INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               Boss Man pulls his .38.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Good christ! They're cannibals!

               EXT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               Papa Beast moves behind Mamma Beast and, despite the fact 
               that everyone is watching them, they go to work making ANOTHER 
               CHILD.

               INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

                                     GOOD GUY
                              (pure shock)
                         Oh... my... god.

               EXT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               Yes, Mamma Beast and Papa Beast are having MONSTER SEX.

               INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

                                     BOZO
                         Dude, they're fuckin'!

               EXT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               Unlike humans, Papa Beast finishes and the birth cycle lasts 
               all of thirty seconds. Momma Beast's belly balloons up and 
               she squats.

               POP! A SLIMY OBJECT the size and shape of a vacuum cleaner 
               drops from her.

               INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               Para's amazed.

                                     PARA
                         Wow!

               Good Girl VOMITS.

               EXT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               The slimy object twitches and then SPLITS in half. The two 
               halves spring appendages and raise their heads. The TWIN 
               SISTER BEASTS have been born.

               Papa moves forward and cleans off his new baby girls. The 
               Beast Girls look at the bar and hiss in unison.

               INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               Heroine's eyes bulge.

                                     HEROINE
                         Get back!

               SLAM-SLAM! The two hissing Beast Girls strike the bar front. 
               Roadie shoves that board back over the hole.

               Good Guy is holding back the still heaving Good Girl's hair.

                                     BOZO
                         Any more ideas Animal Planet?

                                     BEER GUY
                         You weren't helpin'.

                                     BOZO
                         Go douche.

                                     BARTENDER
                         What now?

                                     ADULTERER
                         We're stuck in here. That's what.

               Heroine eyes the bar's many weakened points. Boss Man 
               addresses Heroine.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         We've got some tools, and extra planks 
                         in the back, if we're on the same 
                         page.

               Heroine addresses the group.

                                     HEROINE
                         Let's work.

               MONTAGE OF LOCKING DOWN THE BAR

               Various hands find tools and spare boards. Various patrons 
               find more tools in the bar's tiny kitchen and in bar cabinets. 
               Nails sink into wood. Hammers strike.

               Tuffy cleans her son's blood from her body, sobbing.

               More boards up. Debris cleared. Heroine duct tapes a knife 
               to her right boot. Doors are barricaded.

               The torn apart bodies, wrapped in table cloths, are dragged 
               to the kitchen cooler. Hammers hammer. Saws saw.

               Heroine places a board against a wall beneath Goldie as he 
               hammers a nail. Goldie tries to take a look down Heroine's 
               tank top. Goldie HAMMERS his thumb. Screams.

               Wounds are tended to.

               More debris shuffled. Hammer. Board in place. Kitchen cooler 
               shut. Nail sinks. A saw cuts.

               A beer opens.

               END MONTAGE

               INT. BAR -- LATER

               Several of the chairs and tables barricade the doors. The 
               place seems in order.

               Heroine walks through the bar with Bartender.

                                     BARTENDER
                         Well, it don't look pretty.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         But it's got teeth.

               Heroine nods.

                                     HEROINE
                         Will these boards hold?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         The boards are solid oak planks, and 
                         the floor is reinforced by a steel 
                         grid beneath. Nothing real or 
                         supernatural is busting through this, 
                         least nothing the size of the beasts.

                                     HEROINE
                         Good.

               Bozo pops open a beer off the back of Para's wheelchair and 
               nods to Grandpapa Beast's head on the end of the bar.

                                     BOZO
                         Pocahantas!

               Heroine turns.

                                     BOZO
                         If you don't mind me askin', how'd 
                         you run into these things?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         More importantly, how did you run 
                         away from these things?

               Heroine stands in the middle of the room as they all gather 
               around her.

                                     HEROINE
                         It all started about forty hours

               Heroine and Hero watch TV with DEBBIE (matronly, older).

               EXT. PRAIRIE LAND -- CONTINUOUS

               We see the home on the horizon with a big barn next to it.

               Shrieking and flapping grows in the distance.

               INT. LIVING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

               Heroine, Hero, and Debbie look at each other with concern.

               Debbie rises to look out the window.

                                     DEBBIE
                         Holy mother of...

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

               Heroine has the group mesmerized.

                                     HEROINE
                         We barricaded ourselves in the cellar. 
                         Then it was just listening. We 
                         listened to those things destroy an 
                         entire heard of livestock. They cried 
                         and screamed but there was nowhere 
                         to go. It took those things all night 
                         to eat 'em. Cattle, lamb, and a full 
                         horse stock. Devoured in total. They 
                         just kept coming. Like they were 
                         insatiable. The swarm crept toward 
                         the house. Closer and closer, 
                         consuming anything in the way. 
                         Slashing, feeding and licking the 
                         bones clean. Just when we said our 
                         prayers, the first ray of sun hit 
                         the house...

               EXT. FARMHOUSE -- MORNING

               PLOP! A HORSE'S HEAD falls in front of us as we see Heroine 
               and her terrified companions in the sun soaked home peeking 
               out from the damaged cellar door.

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

                                     HEROINE
                         That first beam of sunlight drove 
                         'em away. Somewhere. They disappeared. 
                         Gone. We decided to run for it. We 
                         called who we could to warn them and 
                         we didn't see a soul the whole drive 
                         out. We went all day until our tank 
                         and spare canisters in the trunk 
                         were dry. We came upon a gas station 
                         to refill...

               EXT. PRAIRIE LAND -- EVENING

               The sun is falling into the horizon. The traveler's CAMARO 
               pulls into a small gas station.

               EXT. GAS STATION -- CONTINUOUS

               Heroine goes up to the service window. She cups her hands 
               over the sides of her face to look inside. Nobody.

               There is a slight buzzing from inside. Hero hollers from the 
               fuel pump by the car.

                                     HERO
                         What's goin' on? The pumps are shut 
                         off.

                                     HEROINE
                         There's nobody here --

               She follows the buzzing sound to a corner of the room.

               There is a swarm of black flies crawling over half a STATION 
               ATTENDANT'S gutted torso.

                                     HEROINE
                         They've been here!

               Debbie pops out of the back of the car with the empty fuel 
               canisters.

                                     DEBBIE
                         Turn on the pump!
                              (to Hero)
                         I'll find something.

               Glass shatters as Heroine reaches inside to turn on the pumps.

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

               Heroine's demeanor tightens as the story continues.

                                     HEROINE
                         We had no time. We didn't know if we 
                         were going in the right direction, 
                         or if there even was a right direction 
                         anymore. All we knew was the sun was 
                         dropping and we had to get enough 
                         fuel to make it through the night at 
                         90 miles per hour...

               EXT. GAS STATION -- NIGHT

               Debbie siphons fuel from a TOW TRUCK in the distance.

               Hero fills their CAMARO.

                                     HERO
                         Suck it down you metal bitch. Suck 
                         it down.

                                     DEBBIE
                              (to Hero)
                         Help!

               EXT. PRAIRIE LAND -- CONTINUOUS

               Debbie is carrying two jugs of gasoline over her shoulders.

               Hero sets the pump key and runs for Debbie to grab one.

               INT. BARN -- CONTINUOUS

               Heroine hastily grabs food and drinks, ignoring the cash 
               register completely. The sun is setting.

               EXT. PRAIRIE LAND -- CONTINUOUS

               Hero and Debbie move sluggishly under the weight of the 
               canisters. In the shadows, we can hear the shrill hissing...

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

                                     HEROINE
                         It happened fast...

               EXT. ABANDONED GAS STATION -- CONTINUOUS

               Heroine emerges from the Gas Station shop. Hero is moving as 
               fast as possible with Debbie.

                                     HERO
                         Get in the car!

               Heroine hears the growing cries of the beasts. Her loot hits 
               the pavement as she runs to the car's trunk and opens it.

               Hero loads the canisters into the trunk as Debbie takes the 
               driver's seat.

                                     HERO
                         Get in the car, baby.

               Hero pulls the nozzle out of the Camaro and drops the spilling 
               gas nozzle onto the pavement.

               Heroine jumps into the passenger seat.

               Hero runs over the top of the Camaro and slides into the 
               sunroof. He grabs a rifle and aims toward the leaking gas 
               pool. Something rises in the Gas Station.

                                     HERO
                         Roll!

               Debbie fires up the car and tears out. Hero fires and the 
               station becomes a fireball.

               Debbie guns the auto.

                                     HEROINE
                         Close the roof!

               Hero lowers into the back seat and starts to close the roof 
               as TEEN BEAST lands on top of the car...

                                     HERO
                         Shit!

               Debbie revs the engine.

                                     DEBBIE
                         Shoot that motherfu-

               RIIPPP! Heroine looks over to Debbie. Her throat is gone.

               Heroine grabs the wheel and steps on Debbie's foot.

               SCREEECH! The car 180's and Teen Beast sails off of the hood 
               into darkness. The Camaro tears down a tangent dirt road...

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

               Heroine stands in front of the people near Grandpapa Beast's 
               head.

                                     HEROINE
                         We drove the tank dry, with Debbie's 
                         corpse riding shotgun. We stopped 
                         for only seconds about an hour ago 
                         to gas up and lay Debbie to rest. It 
                         must have smelled the blood or 
                         something. We got back on the road 
                         and...

               EXT. PRAIRIE LAND -- NIGHT

               BOOM! Grandpapa Beast LANDS on the front hood of the Camaro. 
               Heroine and Hero SCREAM and rev the engine, swerving madly 
               as Grandpapa Beast VOMITS on the windshield.

                                     HERO
                         Break!

               Heroine slams on the breaks. Grandpapa Beast slides back, 
               holding onto the grill.

                                     HERO
                         Go! Go! Go!

               Grandpapa Beast tears into the engine through the grill as 
               sparks and smoke shoot out. Heroine jerks the steering wheel.

                                     HERO
                         Look out!

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

               C.U. - Heroine's eyes.

                                     HEROINE
                         And that's how I ended up here.

                                     BARTENDER
                         And the head?

               EXT. PRAIRIE LAND -- NIGHT

               SMASH! The Camaro drives into a ditch. The impact DECAPITATES 
               Grandpapa Beast.

               Its head FIRES through the windshield and lands on Heroine's 
               lap. Its snake-like tongue lashes out at Heroine's crotch. 
               She screams...

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

                                     HEROINE
                         I don't want to talk about that.

               Beat.

                                     BARTENDER
                         So, your husband ditched you?

                                     HEROINE
                         No, no, no it was... it was wild out 
                         there, no time to think, we just 
                         moved. He didn't leave me. He just 
                         ran.
                              (beat)
                         He just ran.

                                     BARTENDER
                         Well, justice is funny.

                                     ROADIE
                         You say there's four, huh?

                                     GOOD GUY
                         There's six now, actually.

                                     BOZO
                         Yeah, thanks for that.

                                     GOOD GUY
                              (heated to Bozo)
                         You know something? Standing next to 
                         you makes me dumber.

                                     BOZO
                         You wanna take this outside?

                                     GOOD GUY
                              (rolling eyes)
                         Case in point.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Easy.

                                     TRAMPY
                         What do we do?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         There's no protocol to follow here. 
                         We just gotta take stock, hole in, 
                         and think a way out of this.

                                     GOOD GUY
                         Do we have anything else to defend 
                         ourselves with? Anything?

                                     HEROINE
                         Right. Were going to need some fire 
                         power.
                              (to Boss Man)
                         Do you have any sort of guns or 
                         ammunition here? Anything at all?

               Boss Man sighs and rubs his head.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         I got my .38 here. That's six shots 
                         and two refills. Downstairs, I think 
                         we got another rifle, maybe a 
                         scatterer and some gardening tools. 
                         Maybe a couple boxes of shells for 
                         The Judge.

                                     BARTENDER
                         I got shells too, box and a half, 
                         tops.

                                     HEROINE
                         Okay, well that's something.

                                     ROADIE
                         So we've got guns, kitchen knives, 
                         pipes, fire and sticks.

               Beer Guy scans the stocked bar wall.

                                     BEER GUY
                         I might be able to do something with 
                         the bottles...

                                     GRANDPA
                         You're gonna need a whole lot more 
                         than that to get outta here alive.

               The crowd turns to face Grandpa and his wife.

                                     BOZO
                         I thought you were dead, old timer.

               Grandpa holds on to Grandma's hand as he speaks.

                                     GRANDPA
                         You young'uns worry about weapons, 
                         I'm thinkin' bout strategy.

                                     BOZO
                         Oh? And what's that?

                                     GRANDPA
                         Sit still, look less like a meal.

                                     BOZO
                         I think that's for bears and sharks, 
                         chunky chew.

               The group's attention shifts back to the bar.

                                     BELLE
                         This is unbelievable. Nobody knows a 
                         thing about these monsters flying 
                         around, tearing people apart.

               Tuffy shudders.

                                     BELLE
                         Sorry.

                                     GOOD GIRL
                         There has to be somebody. An entire 
                         room of people can't come up with an 
                         explanation? This kinda thing just 
                         doesn't come out of the BLUE.

                                     ROADIE
                         Consider us in the blue then.

                                     ADULTERER
                         Do you think they're gone? I haven't 
                         heard anything for a while, maybe 
                         they're gone.

                                     GOLDIE
                         Well, maybe they migrate?

                                     HEROINE
                         As long as it's dark, they're around. 
                         They hide, wait for you to drop your 
                         guard, and then attack.

                                     TRAMPY
                         How can you be so sure? You said 
                         yourself, this started only two days 
                         ago.

                                     HEROINE
                         We learned fast.

                                     BOZO
                         WE? WE learned fast? YOU are all 
                         that is left of WE. No offense Tonto, 
                         but I think someone else should play 
                         "Chief" tonight. Someone that knows 
                         the lay of the land.
                              (beat)
                         Like me.

               Bartender rolls his eyes at Boss Man.

                                     HEROINE
                              (dismissive)
                         Fine.

               Bozo, victorious, sits down.

                                     BOZO
                         Now we're gettin' somewhere.

               Adulterer moves over to the window that has shutters over 
               it. There's a SMALL HOLE in one of the pieces of wood.

                                     GOLDIE
                         Maybe these things are like locusts 
                         or something and only come out for a 
                         few days to feed. This could just be 
                         a part of their life cycle.

                                     PARA
                         We could just be a part of their 
                         life cycle.

               FROM ADULTERER'S P.O.V. - He peeks out the hole and sees 
               nothing, but the dark night.

                                     GRANDPA
                         I wouldn't do that, son.

                                     BOZO
                         They're probably on to the next buffet 
                         by now. There's a retirement home up 
                         the road. They'd be easy.

                                     HEROINE
                              (to Adulterer)
                         Careful.

                                     ADULTERER
                         I'm telling you, I don't see a thing --

               BOINK! Papa Beast's claw POKES into his eye...

               The screaming Adulterer JERKS away holding his squirting 
               socket.

               INSERT SHOT FROM THE EYE ON THE CLAW - The eye sees it's 
               owner stumble back and fall to the floor holding his face.

               NORMAL SHOT

               Beer Guy and Good Guy move to his aid. Trampy screams.

               FROM OUTSIDE

               The eyeball fires into Papa's drooling mega-mouth. SLURP!

               BACK INSIDE

               BASH! A Beast arm BURSTS through the side wall and SNAGS 
               Good Guy's pants and boxers. Good Guy screams and lunges 
               forward...

               He is BOTTOMLESS.

                                     HEROINE
                         Everyone stay in the middle of the 
                         room! Off the walls! Off the walls! 
                         NOW!

               Everyone obeys her command to get in the middle of the room. 
               Good Girl hands a little menu to Good Guy. He covers himself.

                                     HEROINE
                         Now, does everyone agree that they 
                         are still out there?

               The group nods.

                                     HEROINE
                              (to Bozo)
                         'Eh, Chief?

                                     BOZO
                              (mocking)
                         Duh hickey.

               Beer Guy holds Adulterer's wounded head. Trampy holds his 
               hand.

                                     BEER GUY
                         He's out cold.

                                     GOOD GIRL
                         I know some first aid if we have a 
                         kit. Do we?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         In the kitchen, under the sink.

                                     HEROINE
                         No one goes anywhere alone. Least of 
                         all, unarmed.

               Heroine hands the Rust Red Shotgun to Good Guy.

                                     HEROINE
                              (under breath)
                         Find some pants.

               Good Guy and Good Girl head for the KITCHEN.

               Heroine surveys the room.

                                     HEROINE
                         We need to stay alert.

               Heroine takes a bottle of liquor from Goldie just as he puts 
               it to his lips.

                                     GOLDIE
                         Hey!

                                     HEROINE
                              (eyeing Goldie)
                         Everyone take a role. Let's prepare 
                         the guns, ammo and whatever else we 
                         can scare up. We also need to help 
                         the hurt so we can move them on our 
                         ultimate exit outta here.
                              (beat)
                         So, who's going into the basement 
                         with me?

               The room is silent.

                                     TUFFY
                              (shaky)
                         I will.

               Tuffy stands, sniffling.

                                     BARTENDER
                         I don't think you should...

                                     BOSS MAN
                         With what just happened upstairs --

                                     TUFFY
                         Shut up! Shut your mouth. You have 
                         no idea what is running through me 
                         right now. No idea.
                              (to Heroine)
                         I'm ready.

                                     HEROINE
                              (slight smirk)
                         All right.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         I'm sorr-

               She walks by without looking.

               Heroine, Tuffy, Roadie, and Bartender all move to the 
               BASEMENT.

               The door creaks open slowly. Flashlights illuminate the 
               stairs. The group descends.

               Left UPSTAIRS are Para, Bozo, Beer Guy, Adulterer, Boss Man, 
               Good Girl, Good Guy, Goldie, Belle, Trampy, Grandpa, and 
               Grandma.

               Bozo makes his way to the bar for a beer.

                                     BOZO
                              (to Beer Guy)
                         She is one hot little minx.

               Beer Guy and Goldie are trying to make MOLOTOV COCKTAILS.

               SMACK! Bozo slaps Beer Guy's constructing hand.

                                     BOZO
                         Ah-ah-ah! You're doing that all wrong!

               Beer Guy looks up puzzled. Goldie sets his bottle down.

                                     BOZO
                         I'm telling ya, you got the cloth 
                         too deep, you're asking for it.

                                     BEER GUY
                         Oh yeah?

                                     GOLDIE
                         What do you know?

                                     BOZO
                         I know you're doing it wrong.

                                     BEER GUY
                         Enlighten us, please.

               Bozo grabs one of the cloth rags and moves to the alcohol 
               bottles.

                                     BOZO
                         Move aside, ladies.

               He stuffs the cloth rag into one of the bottles.

                                     BOZO
                              (serious)
                         You don't want the rag to touch the 
                         booze, that way you can hold it awhile 
                         and ensure it explodes when you throw 
                         it.

                                     PARA
                         You sure? I thought the rag had to 
                         touch?

                                     BOZO
                         I'm sure.

                                     GOLDIE
                         How'd you know this?

                                     BOZO
                              (to Para)
                         Remember Uncle Lou?

               Para has a blank expression.

                                     BOZO
                         Uncle Lou?

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. TRAILER PARK -- DAY -- FLASHBACK

               YOUNG PARA (8, small, sickly) and YOUNG BOZO (10, Black 
               Sabbath T-shirt, ripped jeans, stringy mullet) both stare at 
               UNCLE LOU (39, tan tank-top, beer belly, boxer underwear) 
               madly running around with his arm ENGULFED IN FLAMES.

                                     UNCLE LOU
                         HOT DAMN-SONUVABITCH-HOT DAMN-GOD 
                         DAMN-SONUVABITCH!

               The two young boys stare expressionlessly at the episode.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

               Para cringes.

                                     PARA
                              (eyes shut, wincing)
                         Uncle Louuuuuuuuuuu.

               Bozo puts down the Molotov cocktail, grabs a beer, and struts 
               away.

                                     BOZO
                         Right on. Right on. Right on.

               On the floor nearby, Boss Man rubs his shin above the wounded 
               foot, wincing in pain. Belle is watching him like a hawk. 
               She downs a shot.

               INT. BAR -- BASEMENT -- NIGHT

               The basement is dark and dingy. There is crap all over the 
               place. Dried out ANIMAL CARCASSES hang from the ceiling on 
               hooks. They SWAY as the group moves through them.

               There is a small cage made out of wood and chicken wire.

               The group rummages through the stuff.

                                     ROADIE
                         There's a rifle and a shotgun here.

                                     HEROINE
                         That's fine.

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

               Good Guy, wearing dirty jeans, and Good Girl return from the 
               kitchen with a sizable first aid kit. They hustle to the 
               unconscious Adulterer.

               Bozo is steadfastly working on molotov cocktails. Beer Guy 
               takes a seat next to Para.

                                     BEER GUY
                         Why do you take shit from him?

                                     PARA
                         Look, yeah, he's an ass, but he's my 
                         brother. Que sera-sera.

                                     BEER GUY
                         Your brother, huh?

                                     PARA
                         Yep.

                                     BEER GUY
                         Your parents of relation?

                                     PARA
                         We lived near power lines.

               Belle kneels next to the Boss Man.

                                     BELLE
                         I'll take over, if that's all right.

               She tends to his foot as he sets down his pistol.

                                     BELLE
                         How are you holding up?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Well...

               He pulls a small bottle out of his pocket and hands it to 
               her.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         ...open this.

               She fiddles with the cap.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Push and twist, it's child proof.

                                     BELLE
                         Oh.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Gimme a couple dabs on the tongue.

               She drops a few dabs in his mouth.

                                     BELLE
                         What is this?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Magic potion.
                              (beat)
                         You should try a little.

                                     BELLE
                         Oh, no.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         It'll calm your nerves. Works like a 
                         charm.

                                     BELLE
                         Really?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Uh huh. Just put a dab on your tongue.

                                     BELLE
                         Will I go crazy or something?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         No, no, it calms you, makes everything 
                         nice and smooth. Just takes the edge 
                         off like a beer, but in a fraction 
                         of the time.

                                     BELLE
                         Why not then?

               She takes the bottle and is about to take some.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Wait, before you do that, help me to 
                         the kitchen, I need to lay down. 
                         There's a cot back there.

                                     BELLE
                         But --

                                     BOSS MAN
                         It's much safer in there, sweety.

                                     BELLE
                         Okay then.

               She helps him up and they move through the kitchen to the 
               BACK ROOM.

               Beer Guy stands watching Good Girl. She starts to bandage 
               Adulterer's eye.

                                     GOOD GIRL
                         Where are they going?

                                     BEER GUY
                         I don't wanna know.

                                     GOOD GIRL
                              (to Adulterer)
                         How does it feel?

               She finishes wrapping the bandages around his head.

               Adulterer is coming out of his stupor.

                                     ADULTERER
                         Lousy.

                                     GOOD GIRL
                         You still have one left.

                                     ADULTERER
                         Right when I thought there wasn't a 
                         silver lining...

               Trampy leans in from the side.

                                     TRAMPY
                         It serves you right. You cheatin' 
                         jerk.

                                     ADULTERER
                         Spare me.

                                     TRAMPY
                         I figure it's karma. You wronged me 
                         and you wronged your wife and you 
                         wronged your children, so this is 
                         karma biting you on the ass, or in 
                         your case...
                              (flicks the eye bandage)
                         ...on the eye.

               Bozo addresses Trampy as he works.

                                     BOZO
                         Oh yeah?

                                     TRAMPY
                         Well, it could be worse, he could be 
                         dead. Then again, the night is young.

               Bozo acknowledges Trampy's half bald head.

                                     BOZO
                         Ya know, that's not a bad look on 
                         you, kinda 1985, but not bad. I'd 
                         hook it up.

                                     TRAMPY
                         Huh?

                                     ADULTERER
                         Leave her alone.

                                     BOZO
                         Hey Cyclops? Let's have a quiet 
                         contest... starting now.

               Bozo turns his attention back to Trampy.

                                     BOZO
                              (licking lips)
                         Ya know, in situations of duress, I 
                         have found that women are attracted 
                         to my authority.

               Trampy cringes.

               INT. BAR -- BASEMENT -- NIGHT

               Roadie emerges with two crates. He drops them on the floor.

                                     ROADIE
                         Flares, the light might scare them.

               Bartender turns holding TWO LARGE MACHETES.

                                     BARTENDER
                         These could come in handy.

               Heroine grabs one and swings it.

                                     HEROINE
                         Nice. Let's get everything upstairs.

               Heroine moves to the stairs, but stops. She grabs Tuffy by 
               the arm and takes her aside.

                                     HEROINE
                         You know you don't have to do this.

                                     TUFFY
                              (shaky)
                         I'm fine, I really am.

                                     HEROINE
                         I admire your strength.

                                     TUFFY
                         We all have to be strong, right?

                                     HEROINE
                         Right.

               Heroine reaches into her shirt and pulls out an IDENTICAL 
               LOCKET as Tuffy's.

               She opens it and displays a picture of a LITTLE GIRL.

                                     HEROINE
                         Her name is Charlie.

                                     TUFFY
                              (fighting back tears)
                         Oh...

                                     HEROINE
                         She's still alive, I hope. I wouldn't 
                         have made it this far if it weren't 
                         for the chance of seeing my little 
                         girl again. I need to get to her.

                                     TUFFY
                         I'll do anything to help.

                                     HEROINE
                         I know. Thanks. Just don't tell anyone 
                         I have a soft side.

                                     TUFFY
                              (tiny smile)
                         Deal.

               INT. BAR -- KITCHEN -- NIGHT

               Boss Man is lying on a cot, kissing Belle. She pulls away 
               and brushes back her hair.

                                     BELLE
                         Doesn't your foot hurt?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         I can't feel a thing, Hon.

               She touches his crotch.

                                     BELLE
                         How 'bout now?

               She stands up and starts to take off her clothes.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         You're a bad little girl, aren't 
                         you.

               She dances around, high.

                                     BELLE
                         Um-hmmm.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         The girl's got rhythm.

               She takes off her blouse and tosses it at him.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Whoaaaa...

               She lifts up her skirt and bends over, giggling.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         There it is.

               She rubs her hands over her rounded ass and flicks her tongue.

                                     BELLE
                         You wanna see, baby?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Sure.

                                     BELLE
                         How much you got?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         How much I got, what?

               She turns and rubs her breasts together.

                                     BELLE
                         How much you got to see the show?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         You don't understand sweety, Daddy 
                         doesn't pay, Daddy sees the show for 
                         free. But you do get points for being 
                         horny on a night like this.

               She cringes and backs up a little.

                                     BELLE
                         What? Really?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Uh huh, now wiggle that sweet little 
                         ass over here and sit on Daddy's 
                         face, I wanna do some appraising.

               Belle leans forward with puckered lips.

                                     BELLE
                         Um-hmmm.

               CRASH! Sister Beast #1 and Sister Beast #2 REACH through the 
               side wall and GRAB Belle by the scalp. She is JERKED against 
               the wall.

               BAM! BAM! BAM! She's slammed against the wall again and then- 
               RIP! Belle's skin is TORN from her head and torso.

               Boss Man jumps back.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Hoh-SHIT! Help!! Help me!!!

               The howling Belle FALLS into Boss Man's arms for a hideous 
               KISS.

               FROM MAIN BAR

               Heroine whips attention to the screams. The armed group runs.

               IN BACK ROOM

                                     BOSS MAN
                         NO! NO! NO!

               Boss Man shoves the screaming Belle back against the wall.

               Sister Beast #2 pokes her head inside the room, hissing.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         OHH JESUS! HELLLP!

               Belle's wild arms SMEAR blood all over Boss Man.

               BAM! The door is kicked open.

               BOOM! Road's shotgun blast takes out Belle.

               Heroine lunges at Sister Beast #2. The machete chops. The 
               upper half of Sister Beast #2 drops to the floor.

               SPLUT! Belle's dead body falls.

               Sister Beast #2's torso PROPS UP. She RUNS using her hands 
               as legs.

               Heroine hacks at it, but misses.

               Sister Beast #2 claws into Boss Man's wrapped foot. Blood 
               squirts!

               Boss Man WAILS in pain and SHAKES his foot with the Sister 
               Beast #2 still attached.

               Heroine swings the machete. Sister Beast #2 releases.

               SPLUTCH! Boss Man's foot is hacked into. He cries out.

               Sister Beast #2, trailing guts, climbs up on the bed and 
               heads straight for Boss Man's CROTCH. He screams, backing 
               up.

               She lunges!

               CHOP! Heroine swings the machete and SLICES the Sister Beast 
               #2's torso in half. The two halves fall to the floor, 
               wiggling.

               Heroine HACKS her into tiny little pieces.

               Boss Man grabs his crotch making sure everything is still 
               intact.

                                     HEROINE
                              (panting)
                         I told you to stay in the main room.

               Boss Man squirms in the bed.

                                     BOSS MAN
                              (shocked)
                         Mmmm-yyy f-fooot!

               Bozo peeks in.

                                     BOZO
                         Medic!

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

               The group carries the remaining SUPPLIES up from the basement.

               Good Girl pensively stays on her phone. Dialing. Waiting and 
               dialing. She puts the phone down.

                                     GOOD GIRL
                         I can't get anybody. I don't even 
                         know if I have a signal anymore.

               Beer Guy and Bartender talk while unloading the crates of 
               FLARES.

                                     BEER GUY
                         I have a CB in my truck, we could 
                         get some help out here.

                                     BARTENDER
                         Who the hell would you call?

                                     BEER GUY
                         Anyone.

                                     BOZO
                         Do you drive a short beer bus or 
                         something? You go out there you get 
                         eaten, you stay in here you get eaten, 
                         anyone comes to help they get eaten. 
                         Don't you see a pattern here, Spuds 
                         Makenzie?

                                     BEER GUY
                              (sarcastically)
                         Well then I guess we should just 
                         give up.

                                     BOZO
                              (re: Trampy)
                         Believe me, I'd love to save the day 
                         and get some heroic snatch. But it's 
                         not in the cards, partner.

                                     BARTENDER
                         I think I know where a CB is.

                                     BOZO
                         Where's that?

                                     BARTENDER
                         Upstairs.

               Bozo turns to Boss Man and hollers.

                                     BOZO
                         Hey, Hop-a-long! You holding out on 
                         us? You got a CB upstairs?

               Boss Man, pale and morphine pumped, sits at a table with his 
               foot raised.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Go for it. It's by the far wall. A 
                         small wave band. Channel 9 is the 
                         emergency frequency. But I don't see 
                         the point.

                                     HEROINE
                         You're wasting your time, there's no 
                         one out there.

                                     BOZO
                         Oh yeah, hot pants? Well I'll be the 
                         judge of that.
                              (hands out)
                         Shotgun please.

               Heroine hands it over.

                                     HEROINE
                         Fine, Chief.

                                     BOZO
                         Gimme the keys.

                                     HEROINE
                         NO, but I will lock you in.

                                     BOZO
                         What?

                                     HEROINE
                         We'll be on the other side waiting 
                         for you. If you become food I don't 
                         want the only set of keys in the 
                         belly of one of those things. It's 
                         your funeral.

                                     BEER GUY
                         We're better off.

                                     BOZO
                         Who's with me?

               No one budges.

               Bozo glares at them.

                                     GRANDPA
                              (rising from his seat)
                         I'll go with ya.

                                     BOZO
                         What are you gonna do? Throw your 
                         teeth at 'em? Sit down, Cocoon.

               Bozo moves to the staircase. There's blood at the bottom and 
               it gets worse with each step. Heroine leans in toward him.

                                     HEROINE
                              (stern)
                         You are taking a chance that is not 
                         worth the risk.

                                     BOZO
                         Well, we are one miracle short 
                         tonight. So, just guard the stairs?

                                     HEROINE
                         Done. But you're locked in.
                              (to Bartender)
                         Will you hold the keys?

               Bartender nods, taking the machete. The trio climbs the 
               staircase. Bozo slightly slips on the blood. He grips the 
               railing and pulls himself up the staircase like an old man.

                                     BOZO
                         Now, I don't want to hear any of 
                         this... "oh, I dropped the key", 
                         "wrong key", "ain't no key here." 
                         When I want out, I want out, ok?

               Bartender holds up and shakes the keys.

                                     BARTENDER
                         They're right here.

               ON SECOND FLOOR

                                     HEROINE
                              (whisper)
                         Hey!

                                     BOZO
                         What?!

                                     HEROINE
                         Move slow and move quiet.

                                     BOZO
                         No shit.

               Bozo, Heroine and Bartender unblock, then unlock the door.

               It swings open.

                                     HEROINE
                         Move it!

                                     BOZO
                              (to Bartender)
                         You keep that key handy.

               Bartender has the key loaded into the thick dead bolt, ready 
               to move.

               Bartender nods.

               Bozo, bug-eyed, hustles in. The door shuts and locks.

                                     BOZO
                         Wish me luck!

               WHAM! Bozo is on the ground.

               FROM OUTSIDE THE DOOR

                                     HEROINE
                         Shit!

                                     BOZO (O.S.)
                         I'm fine! I'm fine!

               INSIDE SECOND FLOOR

               Bozo rises and nervously surveys the damaged floor.

                                     BOZO
                              (anxious, hushed)
                         Come on. Come on. Come on!

               Bozo jumps when he sees the gore and the bloody shoes from 
               Cody's attack. The static signal from the TV ILLUMINATES the 
               room.

                                     BOZO
                              (cringing)
                         Geeezzzus.

               He moves slowly.

                                     BOZO
                         Okay, now. Easy steps. Easy breaths. 
                         Easy steps.

               FROM OUTSIDE THE DOOR

                                     BARTENDER
                         Come on, come on.

               BEHIND THEM, through a boarded window, something CRAWLS 
               upward.

               Not noticing, Heroine bites her lip.

               INSIDE THE SECOND FLOOR

               Bozo moves turtle slow.

                                     BOZO
                              (slowly)
                         Lamaze. Lamaze. Lamaze.

               He moves to the door of Boss Man's private room.

               DOWNSTAIRS

               Everyone is looking up at the ceiling following Bozo's foot 
               steps.

               INSIDE THE SECOND FLOOR

               Bozo, still creeping toward the door, puts his hand out to 
               open it.

               DOWNSTAIRS

               Everyone's head stops turning as Bozo's foot steps stop.

               Good Girl inhales deeply.

               INSIDE THE SECOND FLOOR

               Bozo, trembling, touches the knob and...

               DOWNSTAIRS

               Goldie has his teeth clenched.

               INSIDE THE SECOND FLOOR

               CREEEEEEEEAK! The door eases open. Bozo steps inside the 
               room.

               DOWNSTAIRS

               Good Girl exhales.

               OUTSIDE THE DOOR

                                     BARTENDER
                         Jesus Christ, I'm gonna have a stroke.

                                     HEROINE
                         Easy.

               INSIDE THE SECOND FLOOR

               Bozo moves over to a lamp. He goes to pull the chain.

               REEEEEEEEE! A bat FLIES off the lamp shade screeching.

               Bozo falls backwards.

                                     BOZO
                         HAAAA!

               DOWNSTAIRS

               The group jumps.

               OUTSIDE THE DOOR

               Heroine turns to Bartender.

               INSIDE THE SECOND FLOOR

               Bozo gets off the floor again. He may have filled his pants.

                                     BOZO
                              (to everyone)
                         JUST A BAT! I'M FINE! JUST A BAT! 
                         SORRY!

               OUTSIDE THE DOOR

                                     HEROINE
                         If he doesn't shut up...

               ON SECOND FLOOR

               Bozo turns and points the gun around the room.

               He moves slowly.

               He sees the CB. It is like an intercom with a cable running 
               outside.

               He drops the shotgun and hustles to the CB. He fidgets with 
               the knobs.

                                     BOZO
                         Hello? Anyone there? We need help 
                         out here at the United Nations Tavern. 
                         Send guns, tanks, and all that shit. 
                         10-4. S.O.S. Help us please.

               All we hear is STATIC.

                                     BOZO
                              (to Heroine)
                         I found it! I found it!

               A faint GROWL is heard outside.

               ON STAIRCASE

               Heroine hears the growl.

                                     HEROINE
                         Hurry!

               ON SECOND FLOOR

                                     BOZO
                         REPEAT. WE NEED HELP. SOS. CALLING 
                         ALL CARS! WE NEED HELP AT THE UNITED 
                         NATIONS TAV--!

               WHOOP! The CB is JERKED from Bozo's hands and slams into the 
               wall creating a CRACK. CHEWING SOUNDS can be heard.

                                     BOZO
                         SHIT.

               ON STAIRCASE

                                     HEROINE
                         MOVE YOUR ASS!

               INSIDE THE SECOND FLOOR

               Bozo aims the gun at the chewing sound...

               A pop and fizzle.

                                     BOZO
                         Misfire!

               He spins and runs to the door.

               OUTSIDE

               Claws TEAR at the wall. The CB pops out.

               INSIDE AT STAIRCASE DOOR

               Bozo, watching the growing threat, knocks on the door.

                                     BOZO
                         Okay, I'm ready to come out now.

               OUTSIDE DOOR

               Bartender confidently sticks the key in the lock and turns.

               CLICK! It breaks off in the lock.

                                     BARTENDER
                         Oh!

               INSIDE DOOR

                                     BOZO
                         "OH!?" WHAT IS "OH?" What does "oh" 
                         mean?

               Bozo knocks on the door hard.

                                     BOZO
                         HEY! OPEN IT!!

               A white beast arm comes through the hole in the wall. Bozo 
               yelps.

               OUTSIDE DOOR

               Bartender looks to Heroine.

                                     BARTENDER
                         Wha?

               INSIDE DOOR

                                     BOZO
                         OPEN THE DOOR!

               BASH! The boards fly off the wall in Boss Man's room.

               Bozo spins still pounding the door.

               OUTSIDE DOOR

               Heroine RIPS the earring from Bartender's ear. He screams.

               She jams the backing into the lock.

               INSIDE DOOR

               Bozo bangs on the door and looks over his shoulder at the 
               Mother and Father Beast chomping at the wall.

                                     BOZO
                         GET ME OUTTA HERE!

               OUTSIDE DOOR

               Heroine frantically tries to pry the lock open.

               INSIDE DOOR

               Bozo kicks and punches the door.

                                     BOZO
                         HELP! GOD-DAMNIT!

               DOWNSTAIRS

               The group is mesmerized.

                                     PARA
                         Oh please, no.

               OUTSIDE THE DOOR

               Heroine's picking fingers are bleeding from her effort.

                                     HEROINE
                         COME ON!

               INSIDE THE SECOND FLOOR

                                     BOZO
                              (POUNDING)
                         HELLLLLLLLP!!

               BASH! Right behind Bozo, the boards fly off the portal window.

               P.O.V. - PAPA BEAST - It flies at Bozo...

               CHA-CHICK!!! The door opens... Bozo is YANKED to safety...

               BAM! Papa Beast hits the door, but "something" gets caught 
               on the other side of the door...

               OUTSIDE THE DOOR

               An oddly high-pitched shriek is heard. Bozo, Heroine, and 
               Bartender look down in amazement... PAPA BEAST'S LARGE COCK 
               AND BALLS ARE CAUGHT IN THE DOOR.

               Instinctively, Bartender raises the machete and comes down 
               hard...

               IN MAIN BAR

               An even higher pitched SHRIEK is heard. The patrons track 
               the wild crashing and shrieking sounds of Papa Beast.  ZIG-
               ZAG-ZIG-ZIG-ZIG-ZAG-ZIG!

               CRASH! It breaks out of the upstairs.

               Heroine, Bartender and the shaken Bozo creep down the stairs.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         What the hell was that?

               Bozo holds up Papa Beast's balls.

                                     BOZO
                         Dad's neutered.

               The group is still.

                                     PARA
                         Awesome!

               Good Girl VOMITS again...

                                     GOOD GUY
                              (rising, full of brawn)
                         Now is the time to band together. We 
                         need to rise up against these monsters 
                         of the night! Those creatures are no 
                         match for the human spirit! We can 
                         do it! We just need to believe in 
                         each other! In all of us! We need to 
                         make a stand! Right here! Right now!

               Long silence.

               Bozo stares at Good Guy.

                                     BOZO
                         Dude, are you gay?

               Beat. Good Guy sits down, humbled, and once again, holds 
               back Good Girl's hair.

                                     GOLDIE
                         Okay, well... anybody else have an 
                         idea?

                                     HEROINE
                         Is there any other way out of this 
                         place? ANYONE?

               Everyone has a blank look, but Bartender. He looks over at 
               Boss Man, who promptly shushes him.

                                     HEROINE
                              (to Boss Man)
                         What?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         What?

                                     HEROINE
                         What do you mean what?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Huh?

                                     HEROINE
                         What's going on between you two?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Nothing.

                                     BEER GUY
                              (looking to Roadie)
                         I saw something down there earlier 
                         tonight...

                                     ROADIE
                         You saw nothing.

               Heroine grabs Bartender by the collar.

                                     HEROINE
                         Don't bullshit me! If you know a way 
                         out of this place and you're holding 
                         out --

                                     BARTENDER
                         There's a tunnel.

               Boss Man sighs.

                                     HEROINE
                         What tunnel? Where?

                                     BARTENDER
                         It's in the basement, about a hundred 
                         yards long. It spits out on the 
                         backside of that hill down the way. 
                         There's a truck there.

                                     HEROINE
                         What's it for?

               They clam up.

                                     HEROINE
                         What's it for!?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Grass. I grow some pot down there. 
                         It's no big deal, just something I 
                         dabble in. The truck's for a quick 
                         get away, deliveries, whatever.

                                     HEROINE
                         Is it gassed up?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Fully.

                                     HEROINE
                         Four door?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Two.

                                     HEROINE
                         Open?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Covered.

                                     HEROINE
                         How many?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Holds four.

                                     HEROINE
                         Max?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Seven.

                                     HEROINE
                         Nine?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Seven.

                                     HEROINE
                              (with hand out)
                         Keys.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         What!? So you can just get the hell 
                         outta here and forget about all of 
                         us!? No way! That's my god damn truck!

                                     HEROINE
                         Let me make this clear; if we stay, 
                         we die!

                                     BOSS MAN
                         I don't trust you. No way! I pick 
                         who goes! And I'm holding you 
                         responsible.

               Boss Man reluctantly pulls out some keys that are on a string 
               around his neck.

                                     ROADIE
                              (approaching)
                         Give 'em to me, I know the tunnel.

               Boss Man tosses them to Roadie.

                                     BARTENDER
                         You're trusting that guy? He'll ditch 
                         us and never look back.

                                     ROADIE
                         Fuck you too.

                                     BARTENDER
                         Get in line!

                                     HEROINE
                         HEY! No, I'm not trusting him either, 
                         that's why you and I will both be 
                         going with him.

                                     BARTENDER
                         What!? I'm not going down there again!

                                     HEROINE
                         This is it! This is our only way 
                         out! They have this place surrounded. 
                         We go out the front, we're dead. We 
                         go out the back, we're dead, but if 
                         we go UNDER them... we might just 
                         make it.
                              (to room)
                         Now, who else is in? Seven can go.

                                     BARTENDER
                         This is a bottleneck waiting to 
                         happen.

                                     BEER GUY
                         I'm in.

                                     HEROINE
                         Anyone else?

               Good Guy stands.

                                     GOOD GUY
                              (once again, full of 
                              brawn)
                         I'll go!

               Good Girl grabs his hand.

                                     GOOD GIRL
                         No, don't.

               SMACK! Bozo SLAPS Good Guy's ass.

                                     BOZO
                         Get 'em Shirley!

               Good Guy jumps and recovers to calm Good Girl.

                                     GOOD GUY
                         Just stay here, you'll be safe. I'll 
                         be back.

               Bozo moves close.

                                     BOZO
                              (winks)
                         I'll keep an eye on her.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         You're full of shit! You think I'm 
                         gonna let you all leave the rest of 
                         us here!?

                                     HEROINE
                         We're going to get help.

                                     BEER GUY
                         We gotta try.

                                     HEROINE
                         Anybody else?

               No one budges. Grandpa and Grandma look down.

                                     GOLDIE
                              (nodding)
                         Yeah, I'll go.

                                     HEROINE
                         Ok. Let's see what happens.

               The remaining patrons watch as the departing people prepare 
               for THE TUNNEL.

               Roadie grabs a machete and his shotgun... he duct tapes a 
               flare to the end of the shotgun... Bartender loads The 
               Judge...

               Boss Man reluctantly hands the .38 to Beer Guy.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Watch your feet around this group.

               Good Guy moves as the group proceeds.

                                     GOOD GIRL
                         I love you.

                                     GOOD GUY
                         I love you, too.

               Good Guy kisses her forehead.

               They move to the BASEMENT.

               INT. BAR -- BASEMENT -- CONTINUOUS

               The door swings open and casts a long shadow down the stairs. 
               Roadie winks and motions for the truck's keys.

                                     ROADIE
                              (to Bartender)
                         I'll take the car keys, you handle 
                         the doors.

               He hands the door keys to Bartender and cocks his shotgun.

                                     BARTENDER
                         Don't lock this door! If we turn 
                         back I don't want to --

                                     TUFFY
                         We'll be ready.

                                     BARTENDER
                         Right.

               IN THE BASEMENT

               They make their way through the basement with their shotguns 
               leading the way. Creeks and cracks with every step.

                                     BARTENDER
                         You all sure about this?

                                     HEROINE
                         Follow me.

               She turns and something STREAKS BEHIND HER. She doesn't 
               notice.

                                     HEROINE
                         Where's the tunnel?

                                     BARTENDER
                         In the corner, behind the curtain.

               They move to the curtain.

               The light casts a shadow of something BEHIND THE CURTAIN.

               They raise their shotguns as they cautiously approach.

                                     ROADIE
                         Hellloooooooo.

               Roadie moves to open the curtain with his barrel.

                                     HEROINE
                         Easy.

               WHIP! The curtain SLIDES...

               It's a dried animal hide on a hook. They all sigh.

                                     BARTENDER
                         Beef jerky.

               BEHIND THEM, we can see TEEN BEAST rise up and spread its 
               massive wings. It GRIPS the ceiling, hiding.

               Heroine turns. Nothing.

               Bartender pulls out the keys for the tunnel door lock.

               Heroine pushes some debris out of the way. Scanning the room.

                                     GOOD GUY
                         What's wrong?

                                     HEROINE
                         Nothing, just lookin'.

                                     GOLDIE
                         You feel a breeze?

                                     SIDEKICK
                         It's just cold.

                                     GOLDIE
                         Yeah... I don't know...

                                     BEER GUY
                         Keeps the kegs fresh. Don't worry 
                         about it. This place is creepy in 
                         the daytime, too.

               Bartender's hand shakes as he tries to unlock the door.

                                     ROADIE
                              (to Bartender)
                         Scared?

                                     BARTENDER
                         No. You?

                                     ROADIE
                         Of course not. I fight monsters all 
                         the time.

               Bartender uneasily chuckles.

                                     BARTENDER
                         I'd love to be macho, but this is a 
                         pants wetter from all angles.

                                     ROADIE
                         The door... on three.

               Roadie and Heroine raise their weapons. Bartender slowly 
               opens the lock.

                                     ROADIE
                         One... two... three!!!

               Bartender whips open the door. Nothing.

               BANG-GONG-GONG! Some pipes CRASH to the ground next to them... 
               they jump, but nothing is there.

               A little MOUSE emerges from the fallen heap.

                                     GOOD GUY
                         Well, look at that.

               Good Guy leans down and puts out his hand.

               FROM LOW ANGLE, we see Good Guy's smiling face, Heroine 
               watching over his shoulder, and Teen Beast holding onto THE 
               CEILING ABOVE THEM.

                                     GOOD GUY
                         Hey, little fella.

               Heroine moves past him.

                                     HEROINE
                         Let's go.

                                     GOOD GUY
                              (to mouse)
                         She's not very nice, is she?

               He leaves the mouse and follows Heroine to the tunnel.

               SLURP! A pink tongue LASSOS the mouse.

               ANGLE ON

               A red fluorescent glow radiates from the tunnel.

               They all drop into the tunnel, one by one. Bartender, Roadie, 
               Heroine, Beer Guy, Good Guy and Goldie enter the steamy, 
               confined, space.

                                     GOLDIE
                         Yeah, this looks good. Real safe.

                                     BARTENDER
                         Shhhhhhhhhhhhh.

               INT. TUNNEL -- CONTINUOUS

               The tunnel is thin and no more than SIX FEET HIGH. Cherry 
               red fluorescent lights line the top of the tunnel and knee 
               high marijuana plants are along the ground soil.

               There are small pipes above the plants that seem to be a 
               makeshift misting water system.

                                     GOOD GUY
                         Nice set-up.

                                     BARTENDER
                         A bit of heat and a sprinkler... 
                         viola, hash heaven.

               There is about six inches of water on the floor.

               Roadie leads the way and glares at the opposite end. The 
               tunnel slightly curves, so he can't see the whole way down.

                                     ROADIE
                         Looks clear.

               He moves forward and the rest drop in behind him.

                                     GOLDIE
                         You sure?

               Roadie doesn't answer as he cautiously moves forward.

               They proceed.

                                     GOOD GUY
                         Ha-Sheesh, there's a lot of smoke 
                         here.

                                     GOLDIE
                              (to Bartender)
                         Your boss must do pretty well.

                                     BARTENDER
                         He hasn't been able to really perfect 
                         it yet. Either he waters them too 
                         much or he cooks them with the lamps. 
                         I told him --

               Suddenly, there is a sharp NOISE.

                                     BEER GUY
                         Fuck!

                                     GOOD GUY
                         Crap!

               They stop.

               The marijuana plants start to SHIFT and sway a few yards 
               ahead.

               The group is frozen.

                                     GOLDIE
                         Oh no. Oh no. Oh please...

               The plants bend toward them.

               Closer and closer.

                                     ROADIE
                         Shut up!

               Closer-closer-closer.

               Roadie, Heroine, and Bartender bite their lips and lean in 
               for the kill.

               Beer Guy holds still.

               Goldie holds up a kitchen knife and shuts his eyes.

               Closer-closer-closer. The plants part.

                                     ROADIE
                         NOW!

               KAB-LAM! KAB-LAM!! The guns fire.

                                     HEROINE
                         Hold it!

                                     ROADIE
                         Whoa!

                                     BARTENDER
                         We got it!

               The smoke settles.

                                     ROADIE
                         Ohhh.

                                     BARTENDER
                         What?

                                     ROADIE
                         Look.

               Bartender looks over Roadie's and Heroine's shoulders.

                                     HEROINE
                         We just smeared a skunk.

                                     BARTENDER
                         Shit!

               Good Guy waves the air by his face.

                                     GOOD GUY
                         Oh lord, that is wretched.

               They all wave the air.

                                     ROADIE
                         Oh that's awful!

               Roadie holds up his hand and moves forward.

                                     GOLDIE
                              (hushed)
                         Let's go back.

                                     GOOD GUY
                         Okay.

                                     BEER GUY
                         We gotta be close.

                                     HEROINE
                         What?

                                     GOLDIE
                         We just made enough noise for all 
                         those things to hear us!

                                     ROADIE
                         No way. Not yet.

                                     BARTENDER
                         It's a little bit farther.

                                     GOOD GUY
                         Bad, bad idea. This is getting 
                         reeeaalllly lousy.

               Roadie holds his finger to his mouth and crouches. He tries 
               to see around the curved tunnel. Nothing there.

               He stands and waves the group forward.

                                     ROADIE
                         It's nothing.

               They proceed.

                                     HEROINE
                         Let's move.

                                     GOLDIE
                              (to Good Guy)
                         I'm done drinking. That's it. Just 
                         Church and grocery stores. Nothin' 
                         else.

                                     BEER GUY
                         Stop it.

                                     BARTENDER
                         Hey. You noticed that no one's been 
                         killed or maimed for awhile?

               Heroine looks at Bartender. Goldie and Good Guy stop moving.

                                     BARTENDER
                         It would seem like this would be an 
                         opportune time for something nasty 
                         to happen. A couple of life's 
                         peripheral characters to be... well... 
                         offed.

               Roadie turns.

                                     ROADIE
                         That's an unwise thing to say, you 
                         know that?

                                     BARTENDER
                         Just an observation.

                                     ROADIE
                         Well, why don't you keep your 
                         observations to yourself?

               FROM GROUP'S P.O.V.

               WHOOSH! SISTER BEAST #1 SWOOPS into the tunnel, right at 
               them.

               Bartender's eyes bulge!

                                     HEROINE
                         Duck!!!

               Roadie turns.

                                     ROADIE
                         What the!?

               Sister Beast #1 lunges at him. He drops.

                                     ROADIE
                         Whoa!!!

               WHOOSH! She flies past.

               Roadie turns and fires his shotgun. BOOM!

               BLAM! He hits Sister Beast #1 and she CRASHES to the ground 
               in the middle of the group's line, smashing the plants and 
               lights.

                                     BEER GUY
                         Look out!

               Sister Beast #1 flaps and scratches, separating Goldie, Good 
               Guy, Beer Guy, and Heroine from Bartender and Roadie.

               Bartender spins to shoot Sister Beast #1.

                                     GOOD GUY
                         DON'T!

                                     HEROINE
                         YOU'LL HIT US!

               Sister Beast #1 goes wild. Lights shatter! Pipes burst!

               Water sprays everywhere!

               Heroine swings her weapon at Beast #1. It flails wildly.

               Sister Beast #1 bites into Bartender's leg. He yells.

                                     BARTENDER
                         Aahhhh!!!

               Beer Guy crouches on the ground and fumbles with the .38.

               He aims point blank at Sister Beast #1's head.

               The creature releases from Bartender's leg and backhands the 
               pistol. It fires into the lights.

               Roadie pulls out his machete and scrambles to the creature.

               Sister Beast #1 turns to feed on him.

                                     ROADIE
                         Come get a taste!

               Sister Beast #1 jumps.

               Roadie sticks the machete into the creature's mid-section, 
               rolls backwards and hoists Sister Beast #1 into the lethal 
               current of the busted florescent light.

                                     ROADIE
                         Take it Bitch-Beast!

               Sister Beast #1 convulses off the machete, cooked.

               Roadie turns and runs down the tunnel.

                                     ROADIE
                         Let's go!

                                     HEROINE
                         Wait God-dammit!

               Several of the Beast's teeth are still lodged in Bartender's 
               leg. The Group starts to give chase to the departed Roadie.

                         I fucking knew it!

               INT. TUNNEL EXIT -- NIGHT

               Roadie scrambles to the end of the tunnel. There is a ladder 
               to the surface.

               INT. TUNNEL -- NIGHT

               The group with the wounded Bartender move as fast a possible 
               to the exit.

                                     BARTENDER
                         I'm gonna shoot him if they don't 
                         get him first.

                                     HEROINE
                         Just move!

               INT. TUNNEL EXIT -- NIGHT

               Roadie pulls himself up the LADDER.

               He pokes up like a gopher and looks from left to right. He 
               sees the TRUCK.

               It's covered with some sort of tarp. He fumbles with the 
               thick KEY CHAIN. He cautiously presses the UNLOCK/DISARM 
               button.

               BEEP-BOOP-BEEP! MOMMA BEAST and PAPA BEAST rise from the 
               hood of the truck and spread their wings.

                                     ROADIE
                              (sotto)
                         OHH Fuck ME!

               ANGLE ON

               The group rushes forward, but stops when SCREECHES are heard 
               from the far end of the tunnel.

                                     HEROINE
                         Stop!

                                     SIDEKICK
                         What was that?

                                     GOLDIE
                         Oh boy.

               Roadie rounds the corner, panicked and screaming. The 
               SCREECHES get louder.

                                     ROADIE
                         Go back! Go back! Go back!

               Their eyes bulge as the Mother and Father Beast drop into 
               the tunnel and fly towards them.

               They turn and madly run, stumbling, scrambling, kicking up 
               the mud.

                                     BARTENDER
                         Move jackass!!!

               Goldie, at the head of the retreat, does his best to move 
               quickly as the group propels him with their momentum.

                                     GOLDIE
                         Stop pushing!

               ANGLE ON

               Roadie runs. Without turning around, he pumps his shotgun 
               and points it behind him. BLAM! BLAM!

               The two Beasts scatter.

               ANGLE ON

               Goldie moves to exit the tunnel. His head pops out.

                                     GOLDIE
                         We're gonna make it --

               SPLAT! TEEN BEAST pops Goldie's head like a grape.

               Goldie's body falls back on the group.

                                     BARTENDER
                         Good lord!

               Teen Beast opens its wide mouth and shrieks.

                                     BEER GUY
                         Come on!

               Beer Guy picks up Goldie's body and SHOVES it into Teen 
               Beast's open mouth, JAMMING it down his throat.

                                     BEER GUY
                         Eat it!!!

               Teen Beast lurches back, CHOKING on Goldie's dead body.

               WHACK! Beer Guy plants a boot in Teen Beast's gut, causing 
               it to fall back. The group sees their opportunity and sprints 
               to the rickety staircase.

                                     BARTENDER
                         DOOR! DOOR! DOOR! OPEN THE DOOR!

               Tuffy whips open the door. The group piles out.

               Heroine bounds up the stairs and turns at the doorway...

                                     HEROINE
                         COME ON! HURRY!

               Roadie JUMPS from the tunnel, kicks the hatch door closed 
               and scrambles to the stairs.

                                     HEROINE
                         COME ON!

               Teen Beast slams into the wall, Goldie's body jettisons from 
               his throat.

               Roadie races up the staircase.

               KA-CRASH!!! Teen Beast lunges and tears out the top two 
               stairs. Roadie FALLS through the staircase -- KA-BOOM!!!

               He hits the floor hard and rolls away from Teen Beast.

                                     HEROINE
                         Look out!

               BASH! The hatch door flies off as Momma Beast and Papa Beast 
               fly into the basement. Papa Beast flies for the open door.

               Heroine sees a blur. WHAM! She SLAMS the door closed...

               BAM! Papa Beast rams into the door, bouncing off.

               ANGLE ON

               Roadie jumps up.

               The three Beasts cautiously move in for the kill.

               Roadie RAISES his weapon.

                                     ROADIE
                         Sorry about the rest of the family.

               He PUMPS the shotgun and aims.

                                     ROADIE
                         Prepare to join 'em!

               Click -- out of ammo!

                                     ROADIE
                         Oh shit.

               The Beasts SCREECH...

               Roadie THROWS the shotgun at them and pulls out the MACHETE. 
               He rolls left and swings.

               SWOOSH! Papa Beast loses two fingers.

               He slides.

               SWOOSH! SWOOSH! Roadie YELLS as he grazes Teen Beast...

               SWOOSH! He swings for Momma Beast, but gets whacked to the 
               floor.

               Roadie rolls with the hit, grabs his shotgun, and dives into 
               the KEG ELEVATOR.

               He slams closed the door as the Beasts regain their composure 
               and lunge at the closing door.

               BAM! BAM! They CRASH against the door.

               INSIDE KEG ELEVATOR

               Roadie wedges the door CLOSED with the empty shotgun.

               WHACK! WHACK! The Beasts continue to try to get in.

               Roadie BANGS the top of the small elevator...

                                     ROADIE
                         Hey! Send it up! Send it up!

               WHACK! WHACK!

               INSIDE BAR

               Tuffy backs up and hears the screams from the keg elevator.

                                     TUFFY
                         Hey! Hey! He's in the shaft!

               Beer Guy runs over and hits the button. The gears grind and 
               start to pull the elevator up to the main floor.

               INSIDE KEG ELEVATOR

               Roadie squirms as the elevator rises.

                                     ROADIE
                         Move it! Move it! Move it!

               IN BASEMENT

               CRASH! The Beasts start to tear at the base of the rising 
               keg elevator in the shaft...

                                     ROADIE
                         NASTY FUCKERS!

               Roadie pounds and tears at the few planks above him in the 
               keg elevator.

               INSIDE BAR

               Beer Guy pounds the button. LOUD NOISES can be heard from 
               the shaft.

                                     BEER GUY
                         Come on!

                         Shut up!

               INSIDE KEG ELEVATOR

               The elevator SHAKES. Roadie grips the machete and POUNDS a 
               hole in the top of the elevator.

               He squirms and tries to squeeze through the SMALL HOLE.

               He looks to the staircase, Teen Best and Mother Beast are 
               walking up the stairs along side waiting for a chance to 
               strike. A grated wall is all that is between them.

               IN BASEMENT

               CRUNCH! Papa Beast BITES through the floor board of the keg 
               elevator.

               CLANGGG! The elevator stops. Roadie lurches and grabs the 
               greasy cables to stop his fall.

               ON TOP OF KEG ELEVATOR

               Roadie screams as the elevator shakes. Papa Beast is 
               struggling to climb right under him.

               Teen Beast and Momma Beast tear into the grated shaft wall.

               Tuffy moves for the keg door. Adulterer holds up a shotgun.

               Roadie HACKS at one of the two greasy cables in the shaft 
               holding the elevator... Papa Beast is in the elevator body 
               and RISING.

               Roadie almost has the primary cable cut. Papa Beast rises up 
               to bite.

               SNAP!! The cable BREAKS. Roadie SOARS to the top of the shaft.

               Papa Beast is pulled down screeching to the bottom of the 
               shaft.

               BA-BAM! The keg elevator door bursts open on impact.

               BAM! Roadie SLAMS into the ceiling, kicking and yelling.

               IN BAR

               BAM! Tuffy KNOCKS Adulterer's shotgun up, takes the gun, and 
               rips open the keg door.

               Roadie swings out.

               P.O.V. - Papa Beast is right behind him it opens to feed 
               and...

               Simultaneously, Tuffy and Heroine shove their shotguns into

                         I think we have enough firepower to 
                         get outta here. That's not bad, our 
                         odds are getting better. Right?

               Boss Man sips a bottle, still hopped-up on morphine.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         If you ask me, I'm gonna just lay 
                         right here, wait for sunrise, then 
                         walk on out of here.

               He nods to himself.

               CRASH! Momma Beast's arm ERUPTS through the Boss Man's 
               belly...

                                     BOSS MAN
                         OHHH!!!

               SNAPPP!!! His head and legs SLAP together as the arm pulls 
               him THROUGH the small hole in the floor.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         UGHHHHH!!!

               The group jumps back! Blood rockets out! His body is pureed 
               down the tiny hole!

               CRASH! CRASH! CRASH! Teen Beast and Momma Beast start to 
               PUNCH through the floor, grabbing anything they can reach.

                                     HEROINE
                         Get on the tables!!! ON THE TABLES!!!!

               Everyone struggles to get on the tables.

               PUK! PUK! PUK! Planks rip down.

               A Beast arm GRABS Good Guy's new pants and RIPS them from 
               his body. BOTTOMLESS again.

                                     GOOD GUY
                         CRAP!

               He jumps on a table and is embraced by Good Girl.

                                     GOOD GIRL
                         Sweety!

               Grandpa grabs Grandma as her chair is yanked to the floor.

                                     GRANDMA
                         Oh!

                                     GRANDPA
                         Hold on!

               Grandpa pulls her upright to the table top.

               CRASH! A Beast arm reaches up and GRABS Para's wheelchair, 
               violently shaking it.

                                     PARA
                         Helllllp!!!

               THUD! Para FALLS to the floor.

               Teen Beast sticks its head through the small hole where Boss 
               Man's dead body was pulled through. It screeches, but is 
               instantaneously KICKED by Roadie's boot. Tuffy flips a table 
               over the hole in the floor.

               CRASH! Teen Beast's arm GRABS Para's leg and tries to pull 
               him down the hole...

                                     PARA
                         HELP MEEE!

                                     BOZO
                         BONSAI!

               Bozo JUMPS from a table and HACKS Teen Beast's arm in half... 
               he picks up Para and TOSSES him onto the table with Good Guy 
               and Good Girl.

                                     BOZO
                         Hot potato!!!

               Bozo leaps onto the table with Tuffy...

               RAH! An arm grabs a table leg from Heroine's table. It 
               totters. She jumps to the bar and slides on her side to the 
               near end of the bar top.

               BAM! BAM! BAM! The two Beasts continue to CRASH into the 
               floor, trying to get in.

                                     TRAMPY
                         Stop!!! Stop!!! Stop!!!

               Silence.

               The banging stops.

               The room is silent.

               Everyone is on the tables, huffing and puffing, looking from 
               left to right.

               Good Girl tries to cover up her exposed boyfriend. They notice 
               Bozo looking at them, again smiling.

                                     BOZO
                         You're into this aren't you?

               Grandpa holds Grandma close. They still have their drinks.

                                     HEROINE
                         All right!
                              (to Beer Guy)
                         Tell us about the truck!

                                     BEER GUY
                         Uh, uh, I think if we can get everyone 
                         into it... we can get out of here.

                                     GOOD GUY
                         Let's wait it out.

                                     HEROINE
                         They'll tear this place down within 
                         the hour.

                                     BEER GUY
                         There's a delivery tunnel out the 
                         back door.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. BAR -- DELIVERY TUNNEL -- NIGHT

               The tunnel is long and dark. The walls are metallic and a 
               lone strip of white fluorescent lights line the ceiling.

               The outer doors open and the truck is about ten feet away.

                                     BEER GUY (V.O.)
                         We line everyone up in the tunnel, 
                         light the flares, toss the fire bombs, 
                         and then come out blasting.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

               They all hover on the tables.

                                     BEER GUY
                         My truck can't be more than ten feet 
                         away. We load into the back, I can 
                         get in the front and we roll out of 
                         here.

                                     HEROINE
                         What's in the back?

                                     BEER GUY
                         Nothing, this was my last delivery.

                                     GOOD GUY
                         So what do we have to do?

                                     BARTENDER
                         IT'S ANOTHER GOD-DAMNED BOTTLE NECK!

                                     ROADIE
                         If there is only one way out for us, 
                         there is only one way in for them.

                                     HEROINE
                         Make a distraction out front and go 
                         for it out the back. There's cars 
                         back there, right?

                                     BEER GUY
                         Yeah, the lot's right there. My truck 
                         is right out back.

                                     HEROINE
                         But not flush against the tunnel?

                                     GOOD GUY
                         How many feet will we be exposed? 
                         Without any cover?

                                     BEER GUY
                         I dunno... a few yards.

                                     TRAMPY
                         I don't like it.

               Good Girl dry heaves.

                                     ROADIE
                         Look, the armed surround the unarmed 
                         in a circle and we move as a tight 
                         group. Those that can shoot, protect 
                         the rest to his ride.

                                     BOZO
                         Hey, when this plan completely goes 
                         to shit, what are ya gonna do?

                                     BARTENDER
                         You got something better?

                                     BOZO
                         If we move in a group, we are one 
                         target. If we scatter, they CAN'T 
                         get us all.

                                     ROADIE
                         Bullshit.

                                     BOZO
                         No bullshit.

                                     BARTENDER
                         Who's for the truck?

               The group agrees without Bozo's approval.

                                     BOZO
                         We'll be food, dickheads!

                                     BARTENDER
                         Well, your last words can be "I told 
                         you so."

                                     BOZO
                              (to Para)
                         You gotta be with me on this.

                                     PARA
                         I'm in a wheelchair, the truck sounds 
                         pretty good.

                                     BOZO
                         Amazing you made it this far.

                                     HEROINE
                              (to Beer Guy)
                         It's imperative that you get that 
                         truck moving.

                                     BEER GUY
                         Just cover me. It was built to move.

               BAM! BAM! BAM! The Beasts hit the floor.

                                     BOZO
                         Where the hell are we going to go 
                         then, Billy Jack!?

                                     HEROINE
                         There's a bomb shelter over in Durant, 
                         by the IGA, on First. You all know 
                         where that is?

               Everyone nods.

                                     HEROINE
                         It's the safest place until sunrise.

               Grandpa looks to Grandma. He smiles affectionately.

               Good Guy puts his arm on Good Girl's shoulder, and holds her 
               tight.

                                     BARTENDER
                         You seem mighty collected about this.

                                     HEROINE
                         Buddy, I'm a full-blooded Chucktow. 
                         I can't think of a time my people 
                         haven't been takin' it dry. The fact 
                         that we are being eaten now, doesn't 
                         even faze me...
                              (beat)
                         ...this is just another Tuesday.

                                     BOZO
                         Well aren't you stoic.

                                     ADULTERER
                         Not everyone's gonna be able to shoot 
                         at those things, you know.

                                     BOZO
                         That's right. Rubber legs, baldy, 
                         honey pie, gramps, stumpy, and "no 
                         son" ain't gonna be of much use, so 
                         you better think of something better.

               Tuffy sits up.

                                     TUFFY
                         I've killed two. How many have you 
                         killed?

               He leans closer to her.

                                     BOZO
                         You know, you don't sweat much for a 
                         fat chick.

               Tuffy KICKS him off the table, down to the floor.

                                     BOZO
                         Hot shit!!!

               He springs back to the table.

                                     BOZO
                         What the hell's your problem!? You 
                         trying to kill me!?

               Heroine tosses Tuffy a shotgun.

                                     HEROINE
                         Right.

               POP! The power GOES OUT! The room is BLACK! Everyone GASPS.

                                     TRAMPY
                         We're gonna die!

                                     GOOD GUY
                         What the hell!

               BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! Shots fired! Chaos, SCREAMS!

               Heroine STRIKES A FLARE.

                                     HEROINE
                         Stop shooting! Stop shooting! All 
                         they did was pull the power!

               The shooting and shouting stops as the group shuffles around 
               the tables.

               Silence.

               Dead silence.

                                     ROADIE
                         Clever fuckers.

                                     BOZO
                         What the hell's going on here!?

                                     TRAMPY
                         I heard something!

                                     GOOD GUY
                         They're pacing. It sounds like they're 
                         pacing down there.

                                     HEROINE
                         Shut up! Everyone shut up!

               Heroine hops from table to table and then to the bar top.

               She grabs several flashlights and tosses them around the 
               room. They click on.

               The room looks like a MAZE OF BEAMS.

                                     HEROINE
                         STAY QUIET.

                                     TRAMPY
                         They're figuring out where we're 
                         sitting.

               KAH-CRASH! An arm busts through he floor, SWIPING the leg of 
               the table with Adulterer, Beer Guy, and Trampy on it.

               They TUMBLE to the floor...

               BASH! BASH! BASH! Arms burst from the floor again, grabbing 
               for the fallen people. Trampy runs but falls near a hole, a 
               Beast arm pops out.

                                     TRAMPY
                         OH JESUS!

               Trampy is PULLED by her hair.

               POP! POP! POP! Beer Guy shoots the .38 and pulls Trampy to 
               the top of the bar.

               RIP! Adulterer's leg is GRABBED and his flesh is ripped apart.

                                     ADULTERER
                         HELP!

               BLAM! Heroine BLASTS a Beast arm. Roadie pulls Adulterer on 
               top of the bar.

                                     HEROINE
                         Get up! MOVE! MOVE!

               In a mad dash, everyone who was on the tables moves to the 
               bar top or booths.

               BAM! BAM! BAM! The two Beasts CRASH into the floor.

               The steel grid and shards of wood in the floorboard are all 
               that keep the two creatures from jumping up into the main 
               bar. They continue grabbing and clawing at everything they 
               can reach.

               Roadie, Heroine, and Tuffy all pump their shotguns at the 
               creature heads and arms as they pop up from the floor.

                                     HEROINE
                         Hold your fire!

               Their shotgun barrels smoke. There is commotion in the 
               basement. We hear the high shrill sound. Then...

               They're gone.

               Silence.

               Everyone crouches on the bar and in booths, shaking, ready 
               to move.

                                     BEER GUY
                         We gotta go!

                                     GOLDIE
                         What are they doing!?

                                     HEROINE
                         She's calculating...

               Suddenly, a BEAM OF LIGHT blasts through the cracks in the 
               wood walls.

               Everyone jumps.

                                     ROADIE
                         We got company!

               They all stare out the side of the bar.

               Most hold their weapons in their hands.

                                     BEER GUY
                         Who is it?

               EXT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               We see two headlights drive up the lonely road that leads to 
               the bar.

               As the car gets closer we can see it's a POLICE CAR.

               INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               Everyone gasps.

                                     GOOD GUY
                         It's a sheriff!

                                     PARA
                         He's fucked.

                                     GOOD GIRL
                         Someone do something!

                                     BOZO
                         In the name of the Father, the Son, 
                         and the Holy Spirit. Amen.

               Tuffy starts to bang on the bar screaming.

               EXT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               Sheriff steps from his car and looks around with his 
               flashlight.

               INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               Tuffy sticks the barrel of the gun through a crack in the 
               wood wall.

                                     TUFFY
                         Look out! Look out!

               She FIRES.

               EXT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               Sheriff ducks when he hears the blast. He pulls out his own 
               gun and hides behind the car.

               INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               They all SCREAM.

                                     BEER GUY
                         Get out of here! Get out of here! 
                         Get the fuck outta here!

                                     TUFFY
                         No! Don't let him go!

                                     ADULTERER
                         Call for help!

                                     GOLDIE
                         Oh god! They're gonna get him!

               P.O.V. - Teen Beast swoops down and PICKS UP the Sheriff.

               He is DROPPED onto the hood of the squad car face first.

               CROSS CUTTING

                                     GOOD GIRL
                         Oh Jesusss!

               Momma Beast lands by the Sheriff's sprawled body and grabs 
               him by the hair to raise his head toward the petrified bar 
               patrons.

               Heroine locks eyes with Momma Beast.

               Momma Beast smiles a hideous smile. The Sheriff fumbles with 
               his pistol.

               Heroine's eyes widen...

                                     HEROINE
                         NOOOOOO!

               SPLUT!!! The Sheriff's HEAD is savagely TWISTED OFF.

               BLAM! The Sheriff's gun DISCHARGES.

               CRACK! His bullet comes through the front wall.

               Momma Beast and Teen Beast go to work on the Sheriff's body.

                                     ADULTERER
                         We should go! We should go right 
                         now!

                                     HEROINE
                         He's right, let's move. Be quiet and 
                         get to the exit. Pair up, grab the 
                         weapons.

                                     BEER GUY
                         Let's roll.

               Bozo takes Para in his arms.

                                     BOZO
                         Nothin' will happen to you. You get 
                         on my back, hold on tight and we 
                         truck out of here together.

                                     PARA
                         Am I too heavy for you?

                                     BOZO
                         Don't worry, you'll be like my little 
                         papoose.

               Heroine nudges Tuffy as she moves by her.

                                     HEROINE
                         We should stick together out there.

                                     TUFFY
                         I'd love to.

               The group passes out the molotov cocktails, guns, and ammo 
               hastily.

                                     BEER GUY
                         Are they still out there?

               Trampy looks outside.

                                     TRAMPY
                         Jesus...

               Heroine comes over.

                                     HEROINE
                         What?

                                     TRAMPY
                         I don't know, they're doin' something.

               The group looks outside again.

               Mamma Beast and Teen Beast are holding hands on top of the 
               Sheriff's cruiser. It looks they are heaving in great gulps 
               of air. The sound is like a backward hi-cup.

               EOCH-OCK-OCK! OCK-OCK-OCK! A deafening pattern of sounds 
               erupts from the Beasts. Again and again. OCK-OCK-OCK!

               FROM FAR IN THE DISTANCE, fluttering can be heard, something's 
               coming.

                                     GOOD GUY
                         SHE'S CALLING FOR HELP!

               The group eyes the horizon, knowing that sound. Just as 
               feared, a DOZEN BEASTS bear down on the bar.

                                     BOZO
                         The fan has officially been buried 
                         in the shit!

               Heroine reloads. She sees Grandpa take a seat next to his 
               wife.

                                     HEROINE
                         Come on!

                                     GRANDMA
                         Maybe next time, dear.

               The Heroine pauses for a beat. She swallows and runs to the 
               waiting group.

                                     HEROINE
                         Light the flares toss them! Fire 
                         everything you've got!

               SMASH! A GROUP OF BEASTS strike the front of the bar.

                                     ROADIE
                         RUN!

               Roadie throws a molotov cocktail at the wall just as the 
               first SOLDIER BEAST breaks through.

               It screams in a blaze, its burning body spreading the fire 
               to the bar's dried wood.

               Roadie, Heroine, and Tuffy fire at the wall as Beasts start 
               ripping into the BURNING BAR.

               Beer Guy, Good Guy, Good Girl, and Adulterer all move to the 
               DELIVERY TUNNEL.

               Bozo with Para on his back, reaches down and takes Trampy's 
               hand from under a table and they run for the tunnel.

               An arm rips Trampy up through the ceiling.

                                     BOZO
                         Honey pie!!!

               She is turned into a MEAT SHOWER. The Beast reaches again.

                                     BOZO
                         Keep her!

               Bozo, with Para, MOVE TO THE BACK...

               Tuffy helps a limping Bartender.

                                     TUFFY
                         Come on!!!

                                     BARTENDER
                         My leg!

               Roadie and Heroine blast away at the Beasts as the FLAMES 
               quickly spread throughout the bar...

                                     HEROINE
                         Go! Go!

                                     ROADIE
                         Not without you!!!

                                     HEROINE
                         Go!!!

               Roadie turns and moves to the back...

               Heroine shoots down one of the Beasts it falls into the corner 
               and struggles to get up...

               She runs over and CRUSHES its skull with the butt of her 
               shotgun. Blood hits her face.

               Fire spreads rapidly. Heroine turns to run out.

               PANG! Momma BEAST swoops down and knocks the shotgun from 
               Heroine's hands. Momma Beast lands. It turns to face Heroine, 
               hissing...

               Heroine, eye-locked with the creature, slowly crouches and 
               pulls the long KITCHEN KNIFE from her boot.

               Momma Beast shudders, readying its claws for a strike.

               Heroine glares up at Momma Beast. She slowly exhales.

               Momma Beast screeches and ATTACKS...

               Heroine jumps left, CLOSE-LINING Momma Beast with the blade.

               SPLAT! Momma Beast falls and convulses with the knife sticking 
               out of its left shoulder.

               It CRIES in pain. Heroine kicks the blade in.

                                     HEROINE
                         Burn you bitch!

               POW! BASH! Momma Beast flies back against a flaming wall.

               Heroine picks up her shotgun and runs to the back.

               INT. BAR -- DELIVERY TUNNEL -- CONTINUOUS

               They all hover in the tunnel as Heroine sprints up.

                                     HEROINE
                         Stay together! There can't be more 
                         than a few of them out there!

               CRASH! BANG-BANG-BANG! The Beasts start BANGING into the 
               sheet-metal covering the tunnel... dents multiply as they 
               ram into it...

               The group ducks and screams in horror...

               The Beasts rip through the sheet-metal and SCRATCH at whatever 
               they can get a hold of...

                                     HEROINE
                         FLARES! Shoot the flares!

               Roadie kicks open the TUNNEL DOORS... the FLARES go off... 
               the white snow turns orange from the BRIGHT flares...

               The dark sky is lit up revealing the circling Beasts high in 
               the air...

               NOTE: For the next few moments, all hell breaks loose with 
               Beasts, bullets and blood everywhere. Try to keep up.

               The group fire their weapons and run for the TRUCK.

               BAM! BAM! BAM! The Beasts circle in the air, dodging the 
               fire from the group. Beer Guy makes his way to the front of 
               the truck.

               WHOOSH! Beasts attack the group.

               POP! BAM! POP! Guns blast.

               SPLUTCH! Beasts crash into the snow.

               The Beasts that were inside the bar bust out the side walls.

                                     HEROINE
                         PICK IT UP!

               Roadie opens the BACK of the truck.

                                     ROADIE
                         Get in! Hurry!

               Beer Guy jumps in the FRONT of the cab.

               BAM! A Beast slams into the side door.

                                     BEER GUY
                         Fuck!

               Beer Guy turns the key and fires her up.

               BLAM! BLAM! Heroine fires at the Beasts as the group files 
               into the truck back.

                                     TUFFY
                         Come on! They're all in!

                                     ROADIE
                              (to Heroine)
                         I'll cover!

               Heroine jumps in.

               Roadie backs into the truck firing.

               SLAM! The door shuts just as a Beast dives.

               VAROOM! The truck MOVES OUT.

               IN TRUCK BACK

               The group uneasily stands as the Beasts crash into the rear 
               of the truck.

               NOTE: There is a SMALL WINDOW so that the group can see the 
               back of Beer Guy's head in the FRONT CAB.

                                     BOZO
                              (whacking window)
                         Move this girl!

               IN FRONT CAB

               Beer Guy jams on the gas as the Beasts ram the front cab.

               IN TRUCK BACK

               The group sways back and forth as the truck speeds over the 
               rocky terrain.

               CRASH! CRASH! The aluminum siding of the truck crunches with 
               every Beast hit.

               IN FRONT CAB

               Beer Guy drives the truck fast. He hits several parked cars 
               turning onto the main road. The Beasts close in on him.

                                     BEER GUY
                              (into a CB)
                         Under attack! Under attack! Can anyone 
                         hear me!? We're under attack!!!

               IN TRUCK BACK

               The group watches as a Beast drops down BEHIND Beer Guy.

                                     GOOD GUY
                         Look out!

               IN FRONT CAB

               Beer Guy, still talking into his CB, looks up in the rear 
               view mirror...

                                     BEER GUY
                         HUH --

               BASH! The Beast PUNCHES through the back windshield, Beer 
               Guy's skull, and OUT HIS MOUTH!

               IN TRUCK BACK

               The group gasps and screams at the horror.

               IN FRONT CAB

               The Beast GRABS the wheel and turns sharply. The truck JACK-
               KNIVES.

               THUD! The group falls to the side. The truck barrels off the 
               side of the road and INTO THE DITCH.

               CRASH! The truck slides on it's side and screeches to a halt.

               IN TRUCK BACK

               The disheveled people try to get up.

                                     BOZO
                         Blow the goddamn hatch!

                                     ROADIE
                         Clear!

               BAM! The shotgun blast splits the back open.

                                     HEROINE
                         Get to your cars!

                                     ROADIE
                         GO-GO-GO!!

               The group falls over each other as they try to escape the 
               truck.

               Bozo, with Para on his back, Good Guy and Good Girl sprint 
               for their autos.

               WHOOSH! A Beast RIPS Para from Bozo's back. Para screams.

                                     BOZO
                         OH NO! GIVE HIM BACK!

                                     GOOD GUY
                              (pulling Bozo along)
                         Keep moving, he's dead!

               Bozo runs for his TRANS-AM. Para falls to the ground, still 
               alive. Bozo turns back and sees him.

                                     BOZO
                         OH JESUS!

                                     PARA
                         HELLLPPP!

               Bozo gets to his brother and puts him on his back again, 
               runs.

                                     BOZO
                         I thought we lost you --

               SWOOP! Para is RIPPED into the air again. Para screams.

                                     BOZO
                         You FUCKERS!

               Good Guy and Good Girl reach their car. He SHOVES her inside 
               the driver's seat.

                                     GOOD GUY
                              (to Good Girl)
                         Get in! Get in!

               SWISH!! Good Guy is SCOOPED up by a Beast. Good Girl screams 
               and slams the door closed. Heroine and Tuffy help Bartender 
               to the car. They both SHOOT at Beasts.

               RIIIIPPP! Bartender is picked up and TORN TO PIECES.

               Tuffy screams. The Beast drops Bartender's BLOODY CARCASS 
               and swoops down.

               Heroine whips a FLARE into the Beast's mouth.

                                     HEROINE
                              (shoving Tuffy)
                         Get in!

               Good Girl STARTS her car.

               BAM! Good Guy is dropped ON THE HOOD of the car with his 
               body RAVAGED, but his face still intact.

                                     GOOD GIRL
                         AHHHHHHHH!!

               She HONKS the horn.

               Roadie MOVES like a wild man to his truck. He shoots them, 
               hits them, whatever it takes.

               Bozo leaps into his Trans-Am. The Beasts SLAM into the side 
               as he tries to start the car.

                                     BOZO
                         DO IT!

               VAHVVVOOOMMMM! The car ROARS to life. He pushes in a TAPE. 
               THE "MIAMI VICE" THEME SONG BLARES FROM THE SPEAKERS.

                                     BOZO
                         Get me FUCK BIRDS!

               Bozo peels out. Teen Beast lands right in his path and 
               clumsily tries to run to the side.

                                     BOZO
                         No you don't!

               BAM! He SMACKS Teen Beast head on. Sending the creature's 
               disemboweled body sailing through the air.

                                     BOZO
                         VENGEANCE!

               BASH! SMASH! He hits two more Beasts.

               Para DROPS from the sky, still ALIVE and panting. Cars are 
               moving everywhere.

                                     PARA
                              (wincing)

               The burning JUKEBOX plays ERIC CLAPTON'S "YOU LOOK WONDERFUL 
               TONIGHT."

               Slowly dancing and holding each other, Grandpa lightly 
               smooches Grandma on the forehead.

               EXT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               Para CRAWLS along the ground, being ignored by the Beasts.

                         Help me! HELP ME SOMEBODY!

               Bozo turns on his windshield wipers to clear off blood. He 
               sees Para.

                                     BOZO
                         HANG ON!

               Para claws the ground.

                                     PARA
                         Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

               Good Girl hysterically JERKS the wheel of her car.

                                     GOOD GIRL
                         Get away from meeeee!

               Para SEES Good Girl's car.

                         NOOO!!!

               Para rolls right, just missing tires.

               Bozo's swerves to miss Good Girl's car.

                                     BOZO
                         AHH!!!

               Good Girl hysterically swerves.

                                     GOOD GIRL
                         Oh god! Oh god! Oh god!

               Para YELLS for his brother.

                                     PARA
                         COME ON! GOD-DAMMIT!

               Bozo's eyes bulge.

                                     BOZO
                         Look out!

               BAM! Para is SMEARED by Roadie's truck.

                                     ROADIE
                         Shit!

               Roadie keeps going.

               Bozo floors it.

                                     BOZO
                              (overly endearing)
                         I meant to tell you so much!

               Good Girl screams as she drives her car toward the crashed 
               truck. She jerks her steering wheel.

               BAM-BAM-BAM! Beasts ram her car on the side. It FLIPS into 
               the crashed truck. Ka-BOOM!! The impact triggers a fireball 
               EXPLOSION.

               The REMAINING CARS aggressively maneuver around the smoldering 
               truck to hit the OPEN ROAD.

               INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               Grandpa and Grandma hold each other tight.

               A Beast LANDS in front of their table, hissing. It starts to 
               move in for the kill.

               EXT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               WHAM-BAM! Bozo's car is rammed by a Beast. He grips the wheel, 
               but can't control the car.

               BAM! WHAM!

                                     BOZO
                         AHHHH!

               Grandpa KISSES his wife gently.

                         Close your eyes, hon.

               The Beast OPENS it's massive jaws and...

               CRASH! Bozo's car DRIVES through the bar.

               BAM! The Beast is SMEARED.

               The Elderly couple slowly open their eyes.

               INT. BOZO'S CAR -- CONTINUOUS

                                     BOZO

                         WOOOO HAAA!!!

               Bozo GUNS the engine.

               BASH! He FLIES out the other end of the bar.

               He tears through the parking lot.

               Roadie SHOOTS out his window, madly drives.

               Heroine BLASTS away at the Beasts as Tuffy steers the car...

               WHAM-BAM! Bozo's car is RAMMED by two Beasts. It FLIPS into 
               the ditch.

                                     BOZO
                              (rolling)
                         Fuck!!!

               Adulterer screams as he speeds DOWN THE ROAD.

               Heroine fires as a Beast slams into the side of their car.

                                     HEROINE
                         AHHHH!!!

               Bozo squirms in his flipped car, UPSIDE-DOWN.

                                     BOZO
                         Help me! Help me!

               He hears the Beasts SWARMING. He pulls out a BUTTERFLY KNIFE 
               from the open glove box and SAWS at his safety belt.

               A Beast leans into the passenger side of the car and LOOKS 
               him right in the eye. The Beast SMILES.

               Bozo RAISES the knife.

                                     BOZO
                         I'll give you gas cocksucker.

               From outside the car, we see the Beast leap in.

               Bozo screams.

               The remaining THREE CARS race down the road. Beasts swoop 
               through the air RAMMING into the sides of the cars.

               BOMP! A Beast holds on the side of Adulterer's car. It busts 
               the rear left passenger glass and claws for him.

               Tuffy sees this and side-swipes Adulterer's car, SQUASHING 
               the Beast.

               Adulterer nods his gratitude and veers off the RIGHT SIDE 
               ROAD. Tuffy follows.

               Roadie turns down a LEFT SIDE ROAD and tears away.

               Adulterer and Tuffy's cars hurtle forward. Heroine glances 
               over to Tuffy. Tuffy is slack-jawed.

               Heroine looks straight ahead. She gasps.

               A rising SEA OF CREATURES appear in the front of them. Beyond 
               terrified, the two women are awe-struck by the massive wave 
               of death before them.

               The sea of Beasts SWOOP down on the cars, shrieking.

               They brace for impact, eyes shut.

               And...

               Nothing. Not a scratch. The Beasts disappear.

               The women look up as the SUN begins to creep up over the 
               horizon.

               The last fluttering sound of the Beasts can be heard 
               distancing.

               The car SCREECHES to a halt.

               The two women sit alone, a couple miles from the carnage.

               They breathe heavily.

                         Did we make it?

                                     HEROINE
                         I think --

               BOOM-BOOM-BOOM! They both jump and look over to see Adulterer 
               smiling, at Tuffy's window.

                                     ADULTERER
                         Are you two all right? Did you see 
                         that!? They left! We made it! I think 
                         we made it!

                                     HEROINE
                         They'll be back.

                                     ADULTERER
                         Oh, come on! Can't you be happy for 
                         one split second? They're gone!

               Heroine smiles as Tuffy pulls a CIGARETTE from the armrest.

                                     TUFFY
                         We're safe until dark, but we need 
                         to get to that bomb shelter.

               Heroine pushes in the car lighter, grabs a cig.

                                     HEROINE
                         You know where it is?

                                     ADULTERER
                         Um, yeah, thirty miles east.

               PING! The lighter springs out, hot. Tuffy lights up and passes 
               the lighter to Heroine.

                                     HEROINE
                         We'll meet in three hours?

                                     ADULTERER
                         I don't wanna go home alone... I 
                         don't wanna see what might have...

                                     TUFFY
                         Don't worry about that. Just go.

                                     ADULTERER
                         Right.

               Moment of silence as Adulterer and Tuffy look down the 
               desolate road.

                                     ADULTERER
                              (to Tuffy)
                         I'm sorry about your son.

                                     TUFFY
                         Thank you.

               She affectionately touches his hand.

                                     ADULTERER
                         Where are you two going?

                                     HEROINE
                         We're going to get my little girl.

               Adulterer nods and stands up straight.

                                     ADULTERER
                         I wish you luck.

               The car peels off.

               Adulterer watches the car tear down the road.

               He glances up at the RISING SUN.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. PRAIRIE ROAD -- DAY

               A sign reading "DURANT" swings lazily in the breeze. The car 
               rolls by.

               Tuffy and Heroine coast down an abandoned road. There are 
               random POOLS OF RED BLOOD in the white snow.

               They pass a gas station, no one in sight.

               Tuffy slowly turns the dial on the CAR RADIO. Static.

               They pass a house, abandoned.

               They creep through a shopping area, not a soul.

               Heroine rubs her locket.

               EXT. TOWN ROAD -- DAY

               Adulterer drives along a small town road. There's no sign of 
               life here either.

               EXT. HEROINE'S GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE -- DAY

               The car pulls up to the HOUSE. The only sound is the wind.

               INT. TUFFY'S CAR -- CONTINUOUS

               Heroine finishes loading The Judge. They look at each other 
               and proceed with caution.

               INT. ADULTERER'S CAR -- DAY

               He pulls up in front of his house. The front door is swinging 
               open, BANGING against the doorframe.

               INT. HEROINE'S GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE -- DAY

               Heroine enters the house, led by her shotgun. Tuffy follows.

               The place is ransacked.

               INT. ADULTERER'S HOUSE -- DAY

               He enters his house. It too, is a mess.

               He moves through the house, searching.

               INT. HEROINE'S GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE -- DAY

               They look down the stairs to the basement. Nothing. They 
               move up the stairs to the second floor.

               SECOND FLOOR

               SMACK! They spin to the noise.

               SMACK! A shutter NAILS a busted window pane.

               INT. ADULTERER'S HOUSE -- DAY

               He moves up the stairs to the master bedroom.

               BANG! There's a noise at the end of the hall. BANG!

               INT. HEROINE'S GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE -- DAY

               They cautiously move to the last room in the hall. A 
               scratched, closed door without an outside handle.

                                     HEROINE
                         Oh no...

               BASH! Heroine kicks in the door and...

               There's a note on a teddy beer that says, "WE WENT TO THE 
               SHELTER. LOVE GRANDMA AND CHARLIE."

               They both sigh.

                                     TUFFY
                         They're alive!

               INT. ADULTERER'S HOUSE -- DAY

               Adulterer holds a shattered PICTURE of his wife and two kids.

               He sighs and puts it down.

                                     ADULTERER
                         I'm sorry... I'm so sorry...

               He moves from the room.

               EXT. IGA (GROCERY STORE) -- DAY

               The sun shines bright in the cloudless sky.

               There is a stiff wind that stirs up the snow, creating tall 
               snow banks.

               Tuffy's car slowly lurches up the street. Again, she slowly 
               rolls the radio dial. Again, static.

               Click! She turns the radio off.

               INT. TUFFY'S CAR -- CONTINUOUS

               They skeptically look at the surroundings.

                                     HEROINE
                         It's right up there, in the back of 
                         the store.

               EXT. IGA (GROCERY STORE) -- CONTINUOUS

               The car pulls up around to the back of the store and stops.

               They get out of the car with their weapons in their hands 
               and look around.

               They see ROADIE'S TRUCK, but no sign of him.

               Look inside the truck. Nothing there.

               POP! A hand GRABS Tuffy. It's Adulterer.

                                     ADULTERER
                              (hands up)
                         Sorry, didn't mean to scare you.

                                     HEROINE
                         Where is everyone?

                                     ADULTERER
                         I don't know, I just got here. Did 
                         you find your girl?

                                     TUFFY
                         She's supposed to already be here.

               They move forward.

                                     TUFFY
                         Your family?

               Adulterer shakes his head, acknowledging their death.

                                     TUFFY
                         I'm sorry.

                                     ROADIE (O.S.)
                         Hey!

               They all look and see Roadie trotting toward them with a jug 
               of GASOLINE in hand.

               He waves to them.

               They all smile and move towards him.

                                     ROADIE
                         I'm glad to see you! This is a ghost 
                         town!
                              (to Heroine)
                         Did you find your girl?

               Heroine sighs.

                                     ADULTERER
                              (pointing)
                         Over there!

               They all look over to the ENTRANCE to the shelter and see 
               CHARLIE lurking in the doorway.

                                     HEROINE
                         Charlie!

               She RUNS to her and the others follow.

               Charlie moves awkwardly back into the SHADOWS of the doorway.

                                     HEROINE
                         Charlie!

               Just as Heroine is about to enter the doorway, Roadie LUNGES 
               forward and stops her with his arm.

                                     ROADIE
                         Hold it!

               A concerned look comes over her face as she tries to get by 
               Roadie.

                                     HEROINE
                         Honey!?

               Just as Heroine enters the doorway, she looks down. A STREAM 
               OF BLOOD flows towards her. She looks up.

               Charlie's body LURCHES back a bit further, yet her feet don't 
               move, they just SLIDE.

               CHARLIE'S EYES ARE BULGED.

                                     HEROINE
                         CHARLIE? CHARL --

               RAAAHH! The burned, one-eyed MOMMA BEAST lunges at her

               FROM BEHIND CHARLIE'S DEAD BODY!

                                     HEROINE
                         NOOOOO!

               Roadie pulls Heroine back!

               Momma Beast HISSES as it removes its PUPPETEERING CLAWS from 
               the back of Charlie's head.

               The limp body DROPS.

               Momma Beast raises its BLOODY CLAWS at them.

               It CAN'T leave the dark shadows.

                                     ADULTERER
                         Back up!!!

               Heroine screams as the others pull her back.

                                     HEROINE
                         Charlie! Charlie! No!

               Horror fills her eyes as she tries to hold up her shotgun.

               Suddenly, the SUNLIGHT starts to FADE.

               They look up at the SUN.

                                     TUFFY
                         Oh god.

               The MOON moves in front of it -- a SOLAR ECLIPSE.

               The sunlight is quickly fading.

               We start to hear the Beasts FLUTTERING around them.

               Heroine looks from left to right, panic stricken.

               Demonic eyes lurk in the shadows.

               The sunlight is almost gone.

               Heroine raises her shotgun.

               The sun is GONE.

               Momma Beast appears from the dark doorway and spreads its 
               vast wings. It releases an EAR-SHATTERING SCREAM.

               The group HUDDLES together with their weapons RAISED. Tuffy 
               screams as a CLOUD OF BEASTS emerge from the shadows to ENGULF 
               them.

               Heroine SPINS and FIRES.

                      DESPITE THE OMINOUS LAST IMAGES, THEY SURVIVE

               NOTE: After the credits, we wander through the smoking 
               wreckage of the United Nations Tavern. It is destroyed except 
               for one table and two chairs.

               We creep up the table legs to see Grandpa and Grandma, 
               unscathed, each sipping a drink.

               SQUEAK-SQUEAK! The Little Mouse from the basement climbs up 
               on top of the table. The elderly couple stop drinking and 
               look at the tiny animal.

                                     GRANDPA
                         Well, I'll be damned...

                                                             FADE TO BLACK:

                                         THE END
