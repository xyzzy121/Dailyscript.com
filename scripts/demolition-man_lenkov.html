        TWO MEN
        <u>TWO VERY DIFFERENT SPECIES OF MEN</u>













                             <u>DEMOLITION MAN</u>


        FADE IN:

        A stream of mist rises, breaking off in all directions,
        as if inside a deep freezer.  It is hazy and DISTORTS
        all IMAGES.  An eerie HEARTBEAT BUILDS until reaching a
        crescendo and DIES...

        <u>INT.  CRYO-PRISON FACILITY X23-55 - LOS ANGELES</u>

        The mist clears, REVEALING behind it the frozen, expres-
        sionless face of a man, cocooned in a glass pod.  Standing
        upright, held in suspended animation, in a freezer-like
        coffin.  Electrodes spread across his bare chest.

        A TITLE appears in the lower portion of the screen:

                            CRYO-PRISON X23/55
                               LOS ANGELES
                                   2018

        Identical pods behind and to either side house hard-core
        criminals.  A small data bank surrounds each pod.  Monitors
        display digital read-outs corresponding to each individual
        prisoner.

        <u>INT.  CRYO-PRISON - CORRIDOR</u>

        The WARDEN and a SALT & PEPPER ESCORT TEAM named SANCHEZ
        and DOEBLER ride a mobile Cryo-Pickup cart.  Driven by a
        Cryo-Prison guard named PUCKETT.  Down a narrow hi-tech
        corridor.  Each man wears the requisition sub-zero suit.
        They carry their helmets.

                                 WARDEN
                           (pointing to the
                            suit instruments)
                    ...Breathe through the respirators...
                    and keep an eye on this monitor...
                    it starts to jump... you get out of
                    there...

                                 PUCKETT
                    Last escort team forgot to fasten
                    the safety seals...
                           (snaps his fingers)
                    ...just like that.  T.V. dinners.

        The cart approaches CELL BLOCK 60.  The monitor on the wall
        reads: -320 F.  The cart slows to a stop.

                                 PUCKETT
                    Bundle up boys and girls.  It's cold
                    out there.

        The four put on their headgear and fasten the safety seals.
        Thumbs up.  Puckett depresses the auto door opener and the
        chamber opens.  The cart drives in.

        <u>INT.  CELL BLOCK 60</u>

        Rows and rows of stiffs, no pun intended.  Sanchez and
        Doebler look on in awe.

                                 PUCKETT
                           (turns to Sanchez and
                            Doebler)
                    Human popcicles.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    Are they dead?

                                 WARDEN
                    Temporarily.

                                 PUCKETT
                    Next stop psychopaths, techno-
                    thugs, child molesters, necro-
                    philiacs... Aaah... here we
                    are... serial murderers.

        The cart slows to a stop in front of POD 79-SECTOR G5.
        Guess who?

                                 PUCKETT
                    Pod seven.  Simon Doucet.

        A DATA BANK reads:

                           SIMON DOUCET

                                            REPAIRMAN

        The four men stare at frozen Doucet hoping he'll somehow
        disappear.  UP ON...

        <u>INT.  CRYO-PRISON - POST-OP LABORATORY</u>

        A team of DOCTORS and SCIENTISTS work mechanically reviving
        Doucet.  Sanchez and Doebler stand along the back wall
        watching.  Machines jam.  Spit out information.

                                 SCIENTIST #1
                           (monitoring)
                    BP... thirty... thirty-five...

                                 DOCTOR #1
                    Blood transfusion complete.

                                 SCIENTIST #2
                    I'm shutting down the diathermic
                    unit.

                                 DOCTOR #2
                    Slowly.

                                 SCIENTIST #1
                    ...forty-five...

                                 DOCTOR #2
                    Seventy-two percent cerebral activity,
                    climbing.  Should level off somewhere
                    in the eighties.

                                 SCIENTIST #2
                    How's the WEDGE pressure?

                                 SCIENTIST #1
                    Below ten centimeters.

                                 DOCTOR #1
                    M.A.P.  seventy and moving.

                                 SCIENTIST #1
                    Pulse contour looks good and well-
                    defined.  Steady rhythm.

        Doucet convulses on the slab.

                                 DOCTOR #2
                    He's going into convulsion shock.

                                 DOEBLER
                    Is something wrong?

                                 SCIENTIST #2
                    Normal post-op reaction.

                                 SCIENTIST #1
                    He's up to fifty...

                                 DOCTOR #1
                    Strap him.

        Doucet is strapped to the table with restraints.

                                 DOCTOR #2
                    Digit movement.

        Doucet's hand opens and closes.  His body moves slowly.
        His eyes struggle with the light.  He is like a baby
        being born.

                                 SCIENTIST #1
                    BP normal.

                                 DOCTOR #2
                    You can shut down.

        Re-animation is a long process.  For Doucet it's short.
        His eyes open.  He's alive.  It is not a dream.  Doctor #1
        checks his eyes with an ophthalmoscope.  Dulcet regains
        control of his body.  The Scientists and Doctors stand
        back.  Sanchez steps forward and flashes his holograph cop
        badge.  Complete with computer bar I.D.  code.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    Simon Doucet, according to Section
                    795 dash seven sub-section nine of
                    the California Penal Code, you are
                    hereby granted a parole hearing.

        <u>INT.  CRYO-PRISON - CORRIDOR</u>

        Sanchez and Doebler ride the mobile Cryo-Pickup cart.
        Doucet in back.  Manacled from head to tow.  Worn by the
        ice.  He cracks his neck.  Makes fists.  Stretches as best
        he can.

        <u>INT.  CRYO-PRISON - PAROLE BOARD HEARING ROOM</u>

        Doucet is ushered over to a chair in the middle of the
        room.  Three console screens face him.  Three stone-faced
        Parole Judges on line.  They are: MR. RYANS, Mr. Edgars,
        and Ms. Walleck, who at this very moment is fighting a bad
        cold.  Doucet is uneasy as he slides into his seat.  Mr.
        Ryans glances down at Doucet's file and begins.

                                 MR. RYANS (V.O.)
                    Good morning, Mr. Doucet.  My name
                    is Mr. Ryans.  On my left is Mr.
                    Edgars...
                           (Edgars nods)
                    ...and on my right is Ms. Walleck.
                           (Walleck blows her nose)
                    After careful consideration we have
                    unanimously decided to decline your
                    eligibility for parole.

        Doucet's not surprised.

                                 MR. RYANS (V.O.)
                    Do you have anything to say?

        Doucet clears his throat.  His first words are mumbled.
        He tries again.

                                 DOUCET
                           (raspy)
                    Fuck you.

        Doebler steps forward.

                                 DOEBLER
                    Let's bring him back.

        He checks his pockets.  Searching for something.

                                 DOEBLER
                    Shit.  I forgot the data sheet.
                    Can't freeze him without it.
                           (to Sanchez)
                    Get it from the cruiser.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    Why me?

                                 DOEBLER
                    You're the rookie.

        Sanchez leaves the room.  Probably saying something like
        "This job sucks" under his breath.  Doucet is very un-
        comfortable.  Doebler crosses the room.  Taps the big guy
        on the shoulder.

                                 DOEBLER
                    Easy big fella.  You'll be back on
                    the rocks in no time.

        Without warning, Doucet's right hand grabs Doebler.  Like
        a vise.  The Cop gasps.  That's all he has time to do.
        Doucet's left hand rips itself from the restrainers and
        pulls Doebler down.  Doucet hand-butts the Cop.  A quick
        jab to the throat and Doucet destroys any hopes Doebler had
        for becoming Chief of Police.

        The action which follows appears as if in slow motion.
        That's because capturing Doucet at normal speed is
        virtually impossible.  All hell breaks loose.  Doucet
        rips himself from the shackles.

                                 MR. RYANS (V.O.)
                    Simon Doucet, I order you to restrain
                    yourself.

        <u>INT.  SANCHEZ AND DOEBLER'S CRUISER</u>

        Sanchez whistles a tune.  Rifles through a sack of docu-
        ments.

        <u>INT.  PAROLE BOARD HEARING ROOM</u>

        Doucet snatches the dead Cop's standard-issue laser auto-
        mag.

                                 MR. RYANS (V.O.)
                    Mr. Doucet, you have just violated...

        Doucet BLOWS away the CONSOLES.  One by one.  Puckett
        storms into the room.

                                 PUCKETT
                    What the fuck's going on...

        Doucet takes a step.  Growls.

                                 PUCKETT
                    <u>Shit</u>.

                                 DOUCET
                    Exactly.

        Doucet TRIGGERS.  Blows Puckett all over the place.
        Silence.  Well, almost.  The CONSOLES FIZZLE.  Doucet
        hurtles Doebler's body through a window creating an
        escape route and climbs out.

        After a brief moment, Sanchez casually walks into the
        room.  He stops dead in his tracks.  The room's a mess.
        His partner's been waxed.  His reaction is chock full o'
        horror.

                                                     FADE TO BLACK.

        UP ON

        High energy techno-pop version of "HOORAY FOR HOLLYWOOD."
        OVER:

        CREDITS ROLL:  DEMOLITION MAN

        <u>EXT.  HOLLYWOOD SIGN (HOLLYWOOD HILLS)</u>

        Once the symbol of dreams of desires, the defaced sign is
        in sorry shape as it looms over an equally-decaying city.

        <u>EXT.  HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD</u>

        One look at the boulevard makes us want to head for the
        hills.  A tourist couple photograph the burnt-out shell of
        what was once Mann's Chinese Theatre.  A holograph-talking
        billboard promises hope.  It features Ray Gallagher, a
        smiling grey-haired politician with the slogan:

                        "THE SOLUTION IS SIMPLE...
               POLICE COMMISSIONER RAY GALLAGHER FOR MAYOR"

                          "I WAS THERE FOR YOU"

        Gallagher's rhetoric bores 24 hours a day...

                                 GALLAGHER (V.O.)
                    ...I was there for you... when Los
                    Angeles was declared a state of
                    emergency following the 2001 earth-
                    quake... I was there for you... when
                    crack houses threatened your real
                    estate value... I was there for you...

        A stretch limo cruises by.

        <u>INT.  STRETCH LIMO</u>

        A futuristic ride.  Loaded with luxury gizmos.  A suitcase
        stuffed with dead presidents sits on a man's lap.  The kind
        of cash you don't declare to the IRS.  The man sits in the
        shadows, so it's hard to make out his identity.  His hands
        flip through a stack of twenties.  Seated in front of him
        are a Yuppie-like entourage.  PEEBLES, an ivy-Leaguer in
        his late twenties.  REBECCA, all teeth, all body.  Finally,
        ROSHKO, a high-priced attorney.

                                 ROSHKO
                    Our friend Dubbs increased his

                    I like to hear.

                                 PEEBLES
                    Hello.

        He hands it to the man.

                                 PEEBLES
                    It's for you, Commissioner.

        COMMISSIONER GALLAGHER leans out of the shadows.  Same
        smiling politician running for mayor.  He grabs the horn

                    Yeah.

        His eyes go wide.  Great reaction on his face.  Kinda like
        Sanchez's.

                           (riled up)
                    What do you mean he's escaped?!
                    They're not supposed to escape!

                    It's a real mess down here.  Some-
                    thing must a'gone wrong.  No man
                    could possess that kind of strength
                    after being frozen for twenty years.

                                 GALLAGHER
                    Tell Doucet that.  What was his
                    rehabilitation training?

                                 WARDEN (V.O.)
                    Telephone repairman.

        Gallagher glances at his cellular and sighs...

                                 GALLAGHER
                    Just great.

                    I don't want any press on this.  I've
                    got an election to win day after to-
                    morrow.

        <u>INT.  ALLEYWAY (HOLLYWOOD) - TRASH CONTAINER</u>

        COMING DOWN IN A SPIRAL.  The naked body of a man lies
        amongst knee-deep garbage.  Technothug haircut.  Flaming
        skull tattoo on the back of his right hand.  This man is
        dead.

        <u>EXT.  ALLEYWAY</u>

        A dark and dingy side street catering to the rats and
        vermin.  Shafts of sunlight break through creating an
        eerie prison bar effect on the brick walls.  It's no
        surprise that Doucet is standing beside the large trash
        container.  He is wearing torn Army pants, combat boots,
        a Heavy Metal Band T-shirt, and a long overcoat.  All
        the wrong size, but the price was right.

        He walks.

        <u>EXT.  DEAD-END</u>

        An old Lincoln, circa 1995, sits idle.  Dented bumpers,
        broken windows, torn upholstery, obviously not a pimp's
        car.  It pulls alongside Doucet.  MANNY, the gun runner,
        shows off his wares to a TECHNOTHUG.  He's a fast talking
        shmoozer with the right connections.  His trunk popped
        open.  Inside is a selection of weaponry able to ignite
        a small war.  Including knives and ammo.

                                 MANNY
                    Let me show you how this works.  Rule
                    number one... no cash, no carry.  No
                    loot... no shoot.  That means no
                    checks, cards, food stamps, or IOUs...
                    Comprende?
                           (as Technothug is silent)
                    Attention shoppers.
                           (as Technothug turns to
                            Manny and nods)
                    Okay... rule number two.  Absolutely
                    no refunds.  Exchanges maybe, but on
                    unused weaponry only.  I smell gun-
                    powder or laser heat in the chamber,
                    you can forget it.  Alright?

        Technothug nods.  Doucet walks up.  Manny can't help but
        smile.

                                 MANNY
                    Nice get-up, where'd you pick it
                    up, Psychos 'R' Us?

                                 DOUCET
                    Give me a Ruger .357.

                                 MANNY
                           (laughs)
                    A magnum.  You livin' in the Stone
                    Age or what?  They don't make .357s
                    anymore.  My daddy sold those.  Hey
                    look Pal, I've got another client.
                    Sit tight and I'll set you up.

        Manny gets back to business with the Technothug.  Doucet's
        hands begin to tremble.  He coughs uncontrollably and drops
        to his knees.  Manny steps backwards.

                                 MANNY
                    Hey, buddy, if you're gonna start
                    blowing chunga, will ya do it the
                    other way?  I just had this thing
                    washed.

        Doucet pulls himself up.  He doesn't look so good.  He
        reaches into Manny's trunk.  Manny pulls him out.

                                 MANNY
                    Whoa, whoa, eager little Merc
                    ain't ya?

        Doucet pushes Manny aside.

                                 TECHNOTHUG
                    Screw you, Man.  Wait your turn.

        Doucet removes a compact Stinger missile launcher.  Techno-
        thug panics and runs.

                                 MANNY
                           (re: Stinger)
                    Good choice.  A favorite for urban
                    assault.  Dual heat seekers...

        Doucet slings the launcher over his shoulder and pulls out
        a dual-barrel handgun.  He snaps in a clip.

                                 MANNY
                    That little number's light...

        Doucet pivots and hammer-punches Manny to the kidneys with
        pile-driver force.  Manny falls like an unmanned puppet.
        He gasps for air and shivers in pain.  He's a salesman
        to the end...

                                 MANNY
                    Will that be all?

                                 DOUCET
                    Shut up.

        Manny looks up into the business end of a double barrel
        handgun.  Doucet FIRES.

        <u>SERIES OF SHOTS</u>

        Doucet shoves a Buck 9 assault knife into a leather waist
        sheath.  Tapes a small pistol to his ankle.  Opens his
        overcoat and loads the pockets with weaponry.  The double
        barrel handgun.  The Stinger missile launcher.  A mean-
        looking weapon called the AK 2000 (Armageddon 2000).  A
        cross between a bazooka and an M57.

        BACK TO SCENE

        Doucet zips up.  Loaded to the gills with hardware.  He
        grins.

                                 DOUCET
                    Dressed to kill.

        <u>EXT.  BEL AIR COUNTRY CLUB</u>

        Judge Baker hits his drive.  He's in his mid-seventies.
        His partner checks wind temperature against the fairway
        distance.  Using a portable golf computer.  It chooses
        his club for him.  Judge Baker shakes his head.  He's
        impatient.

                                 JUDGE BAKER
                    Meet you at the tee.

        Judger Baker climbs into his golf cart and speeds off.
        Halfway down the fairway a commotion catches his attention.
        He turns, as Manny's Lincoln tears up the green.  Doucet
        drives.  The car makes a beeline towards Judge Baker.

        Judge Baker's eyes go wide.  Doucet is a man hard to
        forget.  The golf cart peels out, but the Lincoln blind-
        sides it.  Sending the vehicle and Judge Baker into the
        water.  Both hit the bottom hard and fast.  I guess the
        Judge's partner won this round.

        <u>INT.  CENTURY CITY HI-RISE - PARKING GARAGE</u>

        Hot shot private attorney TIM DULEY heads for his Porsche.
        He's in his early sixties.  You just know he watches
        "L.A.  Law" reruns.  Manny's LINCOLN SCREECHES 'round a
        corner.  Pins Duley to the wall.  His legs crack.  Doucet
        steps out of the car.  Duley pleads.

                                 DULEY
                    Pleeeeaaasee.  Don't kill me...
                    don't kill me.

                                 DOUCET
                           (taunts and mimics
                            the lawyer)
                    Pleeeeaaasee.  Don't kill me...
                    don't kill me.

        Doucet empties an entire clip into Duley's Versace suit.
        Luckily he's never going to need it again.

        <u>INT.  HOLLYWOOD POLICE DEPARTMENT - BOOKING ROOM</u>

        Looks like NASA.  Cops and computers.  Officer Sanchez sits
        in front of his terminal.  He's a determined man.  Doucet's
        profile on line.  OFFICER SHEPPARD passes from behind.

                                 SHEPPARD
                           (re: Sanchez's terminal)
                    Jesus, Sanchez... what do you think
                    you're doin'?  That's flatfoot data.
                    You're not supposed to have access
                    to that.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    This is the guy that killed my
                    partner.

                                 SHEPPARD
                    You startin' a fan club or some-
                    thin'?

                                 SANCHEZ
                    Says here one of our boys brought
                    him down.  You ever heard of a
                    badge named Wade?

        It rings a bell.

                                 SHEPPARD
                    Demolition Man.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    What's it mean?

                                 SHEPPARD
                    You never want to find out.

                                 SANCHEZ
                           (re: terminal)
                    Take a look at this.

        Sheppard leans in.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    He had a partner.  Our own Ray
                    Gallagher.
                           (reading)
                    He tagged Wade dangerously defiant.
                    Psychotic.  Reckless.  Seems our
                    Commissioner didn't like him much.
                    Busted his buns on a narcotic's
                    violation.
                           (reading/surprised)
                    Wade was sentenced to twenty-five
                    years.

                                 SHEPPARD
                    He went dirty and they made an
                    example of him.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    But he was such a good cop.

                                 SHEPPARD
                    They always are.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    Well I've got news for you.  This
                    dirty cop was the <u>only cop</u> who
                    could bag Doucet.

        <u>INT.  HOLLYWOOD POLICE STATION - DISK LIBRARY</u>

        Sanchez approaches the Librarian.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    I'm looking for an LAPD personnel
                    file on Sergeant William Wade.
                    Shield retired, October '98.

        <u>INT.  LIBRARY - READING ROOM</u>

        Sanchez watches a videotape of Wade's trial.  Prosecuting
        Attorney revs up the jurors.  Holds up a <u>Los Angeles Times</u>
        headline which reads: "HERO COP NABS SERIAL MURDERER."  A
        smaller heading reads: "DEMOLITION MAN GETS HIS MAN."

                                 ATTORNEY (V.O.)
                    ...Hero cop nabs serial murderer.
                    They forgot to add; sells heroin
                    to kids...

        Sanchez hits fast forward.  Images race.  A greaseball
        named Dubbs takes the stand.  Sanchez lets it play.

                                 ATTORNEY (V.O.)
                    ...Mr. Dubbs, you have been granted
                    full immunity for testifying today...

        Fast forward.  Dubbs talks.  Sanchez lets it play.

                                 DUBBS (V.O.)
                    ...He told me he could get any-
                    thing I wanted.  Heroin, toot,
                    crack, weapons, anything...

        Fast forward.  Dubbs rambles on.  Sanchez lets it play.

                                 DUBBS (V.O.)
                    ...He said he had a key to the
                    evidence room.  Listen... I'm
                    a businessman.  I didn't ask
                    questions...

        Fast forward.  Gallagher takes the stand.  Sanchez lets it
        play.

                                 ATTORNEY (V.O.)
                    ...Do you think he's a dirty cop?

                                 GALLAGHER (V.O.)
                    Yes.

        Fast forward.  Wade is dragged out of the courtroom.
        Sanchez lets it play.

                                 WADE
                    I'm innocent.

        <u>EXT.  BEL AIR COUNTRY CLUB</u>

        The battle zone cordoned off.  Spectators watch from be-
        hind police barricades.  The golf cart and Judge Baker are
        pulled from the water.  Police gather evidence.  Reporters
        news hunt.

        A ROTOJET (LAPD INNER-CITY HELICOPTER) touches down and
        Gallagher storms out.  Pissed off.  He heads for a Young
        Cop named DAVIDSON.

                                 GALLAGHER
                    How many?

                                 DAVIDSON
                    One... I think.

        A Plainclothes Older Detective named BENNETT steps for-
        ward.  Davidson heads for the body bag.  He and Bennett
        are partners.

                                 BENNETT

                    I can smell it.

        Bennett's portable police RADIO SQUAWKS.

                                 VOICE (V.O.)
                    Bennett...

        Bennett scoops up the radio and speaks.  Gallagher crosses
        over to Judge Baker who is being zipped up in a morgue
        tote-bag.  Gallagher recognizes Baker.

                                 GALLAGHER
                           (to himself)
                    Judge Baker.

        In the b.g., Bennett continues.

                    Better get a vulture squad down to
                    Century City.  We've got a busy day.

                                 BENNETT
                    Run me down a profile.

        Gallagher approaches.

                                 VOICE (V.O.)
                    ...male Caucasian.  Early sixties.

                    Tim Duley.

        Bennett turns to Gallagher.

                                 GALLAGHER
                    I know the man who did this.

        A POLICE ARTIST steps forward carrying a portable ETCHCOMP
        (Computer Sketch Board) with a 10-inch screen.

                                 POLICE ARTIST
                    This is the best I can do.

        The computer drawing on the screen is Doucet.

                                 GALLAGHER
                    That's him.  Simon Doucet.

                                 BENNETT
                    Jesus.  Sweet Jesus.  We've got
                    trouble.

                                 GALLAGHER
                    This monster escaped from Cryo-
                    Prison this morning.

                                 BENNETT
                    Well, he's sure working fast ain't he?

                                 GALLAGHER
                    I want this bastard brought down.

        Davidson rushes forward.

                                 DAVIDSON
                    Chief, you want'a make a statement?
                    The press's getting antsy.  They
                    want'a get this on for the eleven
                    o'clock.

                                 GALLAGHER
                    Screw the press.

                                 BENNETT
                    Better say something, or they'll
                    be high balling this story with
                    your name on it.

        Gallagher moves toward the Press.

                                 GALLAGHER
                           (mumbling)
                    Goddamn Serial Killer, that's all
                    I need.

        Fake smile.  Straightening his tie.  Very Hollywood.

                                 GALLAGHER
                           (calling out)
                    Alright, get your cameras rolling.

        <u>EXT.  HOLLYWOOD POLICE STATION - HELIPAD</u>

        Gallagher's ROTOJET LANDS.  As the rotors slow, his
        entourage approaches.  They greet their boss with an
        agenda.  In the b.g., a Telephone Repairman works the
        main lines.  Hard hat and goggles on.  Sanchez crosses
        over to Gallagher and follows.

                                 GALLAGHER
                    What is it...

        Gallagher reads Sanchez's cop badge.

                                 GALLAGHER
                    ...Officer Sanchez?

        He's a good politician.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    I ran a GCI scenario on the Doucet
                    case.

        Gallagher snaps to attention.  Pulls out a light pen and
        runs it across Sanchez's bard code.  The Rookie's stats
        come on.

                                 GALLAGHER
                    That's not your zone.  Stick to
                    data entry.

                                 SANCHEZ
                           (angrily)
                    I was part of the escort team that
                    re-animated him.  My partner's dead
                    because of this guy.

        Gallagher walks.  Sanchez calls out.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    Your ex-partner, Sergeant William
                    Wade, put Doucet away.  He did it
                    once, he could do it again.  He
                    knows how the killer works -- how
                    he thinks.

        Gallagher turns.

                                 GALLAGHER
                    Wade's in Cryo-Prison.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    He could be brought back.

        On that note, the Telephone Repairman removes his hard hat
        and goggles.  Reveals his true identity.  It's none other
        than our new pal, Doucet.  He opens his phone bag and pulls
        out his party favors.  Cops go for their guns.  Doucet
        slides down the pole with one hard.  The other squeezes off
        ROUNDS.  Gallagher grabs Rebecca and pulls her into the
        line of fire.  She takes one in the shoulder.  Sanchez
        throws both to the ground.

        Doucet straight-arms his weapon.  Walks and FIRES.  A man
        without fear.  Another rotojet appears in the sky above
        Doucet.  The killer ducks behind the central air unit.

        <u>INT.  ROTOJET - COCKPIT</u>

        Battle mode.  Pilot's hand grasps the throttle.  Finger
        cradles the trigger.  Helmet on.  Visor down.  ELECTRONIC
        THUNDER of an arcade.  In a thermograph monitor we see the
        computer-enhanced outline of Doucet.  In another, a suspect
        rendering body graph pinpointing strategic bullet wound
        areas such as "the rear thigh muscle" and "tail bone".
        A digital monitor reads the weapons Doucet is carrying.
        Another is a suspect surrender countdown.

        <u>EXT.  HELIPAD</u>

        Rotojet hovers.  Doucet re-loads.

                                 PILOT (V.O.)
                    Drop your weapons.  You are locked
                    on target and under arrest.

        Doucet FIRES.  Mere bullets bounce off the rotojet's
        bulletproof frame.

                                 PILOT (V.O.)
                    Drop your weapons.  If you do not
                    comply...

        Unfortunately, the police have been trained to give a
        suspect a chance to surrender before they open fire.
        Peebles applies first-aid to Rebecca's wound.  Gallagher
        grows frustrated.

                                 GALLAGHER
                    Kill him... kill him.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    Simon Doucet.  You are under arrest.
                    Please come out with your hands in
                    the air.

        Sanchez is not much in the hero department.  Doucet FIRES.
        BULLETS TEAR up the roof.  Gallagher grabs Sanchez's ZV6
        handgun.  Complete with laser targeting.  FIRES.  Dis-
        integrates the central air unit piece by piece.  Doucet
        rushes and FIRES.  Gallagher dodges the BULLET SHOWER.
        Hits a wall and crumples to his knees.  Doucet jumps off
        the roof.  Rotojet follows.  Sanchez leads the pack over
        to the ledge.  They look down, but there's no sign of
        Doucet.  Rotojet shoots upwards.

                                 PILOT (V.O.)
                    I lost him.

        Gallagher catches his breath.  Wipes his brow.  Ponders.

        <u>INT.  POLICE STATION - SQUAD ROOM</u>

        Two COPS walk down the corridor.  Another speedily
        approaches.

                                 COP
                           (out of breath)
                    I hear they're letting Wade out.

        <u>INT.  SQUAD ROOM</u>

        The front doors burst open and Gallagher charges through
        followed by his entourage.  Peebles is missing.  Rebecca's
        arm is in a sling.  They all walk fast.  Talk fast, too.

                                 ROSHKO
                    Releasing Wade's a bad move.

                                 GALLAGHER
                    You got any better ideas?  Doucet's
                    dusting everyone involved with his
                    arrest and prosecution.  I almost
                    bought it back there.  To catch him,
                    you've got to give him a little bait.
                           (grins)
                    What better than the cop who put him
                    away?

        They pass a Cop watching the Election News on a portable.
        His name is UNDERHILL.

                                 UNDERHILL
                           (turns to Gallagher)
                    Hey Chief... says here you have at
                    least sixty-two percent of the votes.

                                 GALLAGHER
                           (to Cop)
                    Tomorrow it'll be over seventy.  I
                    guarantee it.
                           (back to his entourage)
                    In case you forgot, I got an election
                    to run in.  I can't afford problems.
                    Doucet wants my ass.  Wade will be a
                    diversion.
                           (smiles)
                    Hopefully they'll kill each other.

        They move and talk.  Move and talk.

                                 REBECCA
                    This could work for us.  Doucet's
                    escape will reinforce your stand
                    on capital punishment.  We can
                    shut down Cryo-Prisons by the end
                    of the year.

                                 GALLAGHER
                    We're going to keep this quiet for
                    now.  No press until Doucet's caught.
                    This thing leaks and I'll have your
                    heads on a stick.

                                 REBECCA
                    What makes you think he won't just
                    take off?  Go to his family.  Leave
                    the country.

                                 GALLAGHER
                    'Cause I have what he'll want.

        Peebles charges.  Two Requisitioned Men in tow.  Dark suits.
        Foster Grants.  Almost identical except one's Chinese.
        Their names are KAI LING and DOKES.

                                 PEEBLES
                    Excuse me, sir... they're here.

        Gallagher turns to Kai Ling and Dokes.  Peebles hands over
        the paperwork.  Gallagher glances the info.  Cringes.  Looks
        up to Kai Ling.

                                 GALLAGHER
                    How did you beat the rap?

                                 KAI LING
                    Arresting officer forgot to read me
                    my rights.

                                 GALLAGHER
                    That'll do it every time.
                           (turns to Dokes)
                    You ever kill a man?

                                 DOKES
                    Yes Sir.

                                 GALLAGHER
                    Good.  You're both hired.
                           (points to his ass)
                    See this.  Your job is to look
                    after it.

        Gallagher walks.  His bodyguards follow tight.  Roshko
        speeds up to his boss.

                                 ROSHKO
                    Do you really think this is necessary?

                                 GALLAGHER
                    Absolutely.  I'm not going to let that
                    defrosted psychopath end my bid for
                    the White House.

        Gallagher storms into the Roll Call Room.

        <u>INT.  ROLL CALL</u>

        COPS listening to their Sergeant.  Sanchez sits front row.
        Gallagher's presence demands quiet.

                                 GALLAGHER
                           (raising his hands)
                    Okay, listen up.  I want everyone's
                    attention.  Sergeant William Wade
                    will be temporarily re-assigned to
                    this precinct.  Just until this
                    Doucet matter is cleared up.  So
                    I want this under the lid.  Got it?

        The Cops can't believe it.

                                 COPS
                           (in unison)
                    <u>Yessir</u>.

        Cops buzz.  Low and in the back.  Talk of Wade and his
        heroic exploits.  The fact that he went dirty.

                                 GALLAGHER
                    I know Wade.  I partnered with him.
                    I also uncovered the truth about him.
                    He crossed the line and paid for it.
                    The stories are true.  If you think
                    he's a hero, think again.  He's a
                    lone wolf.  A renegade with an old-
                    fashioned belief in law and order.
                    The kind of cop I hate.  I want you
                    to stay away from him.  If he needs
                    help, give it to him.  Don't offer.
                    Let him do his job.

        The convict is WILLIAM WADE.  Mid-to-late twenties, it's
        hard to tell.  Probably handsome, but that too is difficult
        to make out.  One thing is certain, he looks like shit.
        ONE MAN, ONE GUN, IS HIS ANSWER TO CRIME.

        The two Guards hop out.  Guard #2 recognizes Wade.

                                 GUARD #2
                    Hey... I know this guy.  He was a cop.
                    The Demolition Man.
                           (knocks on the glass pod)
                    We got ourselves a hero.

        <u>INT.  CRYO-PRISON - LABORATORY</u>

        A crack team of DOCTORS and SCIENTISTS re-animate Wade.
        Bennett stands along the back wall.

                                 SCIENTIST #2
                    Eighty-seven percent cerebral

                    BP strong...

                                 SCIENTIST #2
                    He's coming back.

                                 DOCTOR #1
                    M.A.P.  looks good.

        Wade's fingers move.

                                 SCIENTIST #2
                    Movement.

        Wade's left foot moves.

                                 DOCTOR #1
                    Shut down.  He's coming to.  Give
                    his some room.

        The team steps back.  Wade's head twitches.  His eyelids
        fight the light.  He swallows comforting his dry throat.
        He mumbles.

                                 SCIENTIST #1
                    He's trying to say something.

                                 DOCTOR #1
                    Save your strength.

                                 WADE
                           (whispers)
                    What year is it?

        Wade's words are too low to comprehend.

                                 DOCTOR #1
                    Try not to speak.

                                 WADE
                           (louder)
                    What year is it?

        The team looks at each other.  Each knowing the answer, but
        afraid to speak.

                                 WADE
                    What year?

                                 DOCTOR
                    Two thousand... eighteen.

        It is virtually impossible to describe the look on Wade's
        face at this very moment.  My guess it's one hell of a
        shock.

        <u>EXT.  STUDIO CITY - SUBURBAN SPLIT LEVEL</u>

        Manny's Lincoln pulls to the curb.  Doucet steps out and
        crosses the lawn instead of the walkway.  Toys litter the
        lawn.  He rings the bell.  The door opens.  A woman answers
        it.  Mid-twenties.  Pretty.  Her name is KIMBERLY.  Wade's
        daughter.  Doucet looks like an urban devil.  Kimberly is
        concerned, but strong.

                                 KIMBERLY
                    Yes?

                                 DOUCET
                    I want to speak with William Wade.

        This takes her by surprise.

                                 KIMBERLY
                    You must have known my father when
                    you were a teenager.  He's been in
                    Cryo-Prison for over twenty years.

        Doucet calculates the possibilities of this being true.

                                 KIMBERLY
                    Maybe I can help you.

                                 DOUCET
                           (mechanically)
                    No.

        Doucet turns and follows the walkway to the Lincoln.
        A woman crosses the living room over to Kimberly.  Mid-
        forties.  Resembles an older Kimberly.  That's because
        it's her mother, CASSY.

                                 CASSY
                    Who is it, Kimberly?

        Doucet gets into the Lincoln.

                                 KIMBERLY
                    That man was looking for Dad.

        Cassy looks out.  Too late.  Doucet drives away.

        <u>INT.  CRYO-PRISON</u>

        An ALARM SHRIEKS.  The two Cryo-Prison guards storm down
        the hall.  The WARDEN picks up a telephone.

                                 WARDEN
                    We've got a shut-down on the third
                    floor.

        <u>EXT.  CELL BLOCK</u>

        The monitor on the wall has been blown to shreds.  Wires
        everywhere.  The door is open.  Guess who?

        <u>INT.  CELL BLOCK</u>

        Doucet walks.  M7-42 ready.  All around him, pods are being
        defrosted.  Some inmates come to life for a moment, quiver
        and then die.  Eyes open for the last time.  Hands reaching
        for life.  One man cracks in half.  Another breaks through,
        takes two steps and collapses.  Water floods the floor.
        Doucet continues.  He approaches Wade's pod.  Locks and
        loads.  When he gets there his jaw drops.  Wade's gone.
        Doucet's pissed.  The two Cryo-Prison Guards storm in.

                                 GUARD #2
                    Hey you... Stop!

        Doucet FIRES.  One Guard falls, skidding on his face.
        The other is riddled backwards into a pod.  Doucet crosses
        through the mess.

        <u>INT.  SQUAD ROOM</u>

        Wade follows Bennett through the front doors and into the
        station.  Favoring his right leg.  Uses a cane for support.
        As he passes Cops, the talk stops.  Silence.  Wade's being
        stared at.

                                 BENNETT
                    How's the leg?

                                 WADE
                    Better.

                                 BENNETT
                    Doc said it'll take a little time
                    till the circulation gets back to
                    normal.

        They walk.

                                 WADE
                    You got a cigarette?

        Bennett turns.  Weird look on his face.

                                 BENNETT
                    Smoking's illegal.

        Wade can't believe it.  Bennett leads him to Gallagher's
        office.  Kai Ling and Dokes stand at attention.

        <u>INT.  GALLAGHER'S OFFICE</u>

        Weighed down by paperwork.  Election news spits out from a
        counter top three-inch.  Bennett KNOCKS on the door.

                                 GALLAGHER
                           (without looking up)
                    Yeah?

                                 BENNETT
                    Wade's here.

        Gallagher's head snaps to attention.  Eyes wide.  Play-
        time's over.

                                 GALLAGHER
                    Send him in.  Alone.

        Gallagher rises and straightens his tie.  Bennett steps
        back as Wade walks in.  Bennett closes the door.  The two
        men stand off.  Face to face.  One old.  One young.  A bomb
        could explode between these two men and they wouldn't know
        it.  Wade takes it all in.  The medals.  The trophies.  The
        fancy desk and furniture.

                                 GALLAGHER
                           (hand extended)
                    Good to see you, Wade.

        Wade doesn't shake.

                                 WADE
                    Looks like you did more than jackoff
                    while I was gone.

                                 GALLAGHER
                    Maybe re-animating you wasn't such
                    a bright idea.  You look like shit.

                                 WADE
                    Shucks, and I got all dressed up.

        No love lost between these guys.

                                 GALLAGHER
                    Twenty years have passed, Wade.
                    Lay it to rest.

                                 WADE
                    I was set up and you know it... but
                    you swore under oath I was dirty.
                    You helped bury me.

                                 GALLAGHER
                    Jury found you guilty, not me.  I
                    just called it as I saw it.  Fuck
                    that.  You were brought here for
                    a reason.
                           (takes a deep breath)
                    Doucet's escaped.  Re-animated for
                    his parole hearing.  Killed a lot
                    of people.  Most of them cops.

        Wade turns to the door.

                                 WADE
                    I'm not on the force anymore.

                                 GALLAGHER
                    Well, you've just been taken off
                    the bench.

                                 WADE
                    I want to see my wife and kid.

                                 GALLAGHER
                    Later.  I want Doucet first.

                                 WADE
                    I told you.  I'm out of the cops and
                    robbers business.  Retired twenty
                    years ago.  I've been trained as a
                    bus driver.  Got a whole route planned
                    and everything.  Even nailed down the
                    lingo - '<u>Exact change, please</u>'.

                                 GALLAGHER
                           (impatient)
                    I'm going to bring this down hard.
                    I've got an A-1 badass killer loose,
                    an election day after tomorrow, and
                    I'm risking everything on you.
                    You're going to bring him in.  I
                    don't care how.  If you do, you'll
                    get your freedom.  An official pardon
                    from me.  A clean slate.  A good
                    job.  A chance to get back with your
                    family.  If you don't want to, I'll
                    put your ass back in the freezer so
                    fast, you'll forget you were ever
                    defrosted.

        Gallagher reaches into his desk and tosses Wade his old
        badge.  It's chipped and faded.

                                 GALLAGHER
                    Here.  Now you're back in the cops
                    and robbers business.

        Gallagher tosses Wade an insurance form.

                                 WADE
                    What's this?

                                 GALLAGHER
                    Fill it out.  Standard issue mal-
                    practice insurance.  All Cops
                    carry it.

        Gallagher crosses the room carrying five HOLOGRAPH MUG
        SHEETS, featuring Doucet at various stages of aging.

                                 GALLAGHER
                    Mug sheets.

                                 WADE
                    I remember what he looks like.  I
                    can't forget.

        Gallagher hands Wade the weird 3-D mug sheets.  Wade's
        first taste of 21st Century cop technology is startling.

                                 GALLAGHER
                    Edicon system made these.  Ages,
                    photographs.  We use it to find
                    missing children.

                                 WADE
                    He's not that old yet.  You've lost
                    confidence in me.

                                 GALLAGHER
                    No, but he's going to be by tomorrow.
                    He's aging.  'Bout the entire twenty
                    years lost while being frozen in
                    forty-eight hours.  In that time
                    he'll be an old man.  Could be a
                    year, an hour, or all at once.
                    Called NPA Syndrome.  Natural Pro-
                    gression of Aging.  It affects each
                    individual differently.  I'm sure
                    it's painful.

        Wade's eyes widen.  He lunges forward, grabs Gallagher and
        rams him hard into the wall.

                                 WADE
                    You son-of-a-bitch.  How do you stop
                    it?

                                 GALLAGHER
                           (cool and calm)
                    We have an antidote that'll retard
                    the aging process.

                                 WADE
                    Give it to me.

                                 GALLAGHER
                    When you bring in Doucet.

        Wade slams Gallagher into the wall even harder.  The room
        shakes.

        The door bursts open.  Underhill darts in and draws his gun.
        Kai Ling and Dokes right behind.  Wade releases his grip.

                                 UNDERHILL
                    Freeze.

                                 GALLAGHER
                    It's all right.

                                 UNDERHILL
                    You sure, Chief?

                                 GALLAGHER
                    Close the door.

        Underhill, Kai Ling and Dokes leave.  Gallagher straightens
        his shirt.

                                 GALLAGHER
                    The faster you get Doucet, the
                    younger you'll be.

                                 WADE
                    I'm going to kill you when this is
                    all over.

        Gallagher laughs.  It's a sick laugh.  Wade heads for the
        door.  He tosses the cane aside.  Gallagher wipes the smile
        off his face.  Now he's dead serious.

                                 GALLAGHER
                    You're working a partner on this.

                                 WADE
                    I've been alone for twenty years.
                    I don't feel very sociable.

        Wade leaves the room.

                                 GALLAGHER
                           (calling out)
                    Name's Sanchez.  Pick him up in
                    Motorpool.

        <u>EXT.  SQUAD ROOM</u>

        Wade walks.  Gallagher screams from inside his office.

                                 GALLAGHER
                    Don't even think of going home.
                    I've got men there!  Do you hear
                    me!  You're in my city now, Wade!

        Wade ignores Gallagher.  Crumples up the malpractice insur-
        ance forms and tosses them into the garbage.  Hurries down
        the precinct stairs.

        <u>INT.  ARMORY</u>

        An ARMORY SERGEANT paces the aisles of weaponry searching
        for something.  Wade stands behind the counter fidgeting
        with an M7-42.

                                 ARMORY SERGEANT
                           (searching deeper)
                    That there's an M7-42.  'Bout the
                    same shits as a .714 Magnum 'cept
                    its got a bigger mag.  Almost
                    twice the firepower.

        Armory Sergeant dusts off an old box, reads the inscription
        and crosses over the Wade,

                                 ARMORY SERGEANT
                    I knew! had one of 'ese lying 'round
                    somewhere.  Raids sometimes bring 'em
                    in.

        Armory Sergeant opens the box and removes a .38 Police
        Special.

                                 ARMORY SERGEANT
                    .38 Police Special.  Thing's an
                    antique.
                           (hands the .38 over
                            to Wade)
                    You sure this is what you want?  With
                    this kinda profile, you just asking
                    for trouble.  Take the M7-42.

        Wade handles the gun like it was a long lost friend.

                                 WADE
                    Does the same job, doesn't it?

        <u>INT.  FIRING RANGE</u>

        Cops BLOWING holes in human silhouettes.  Hi-tech firepower
        all around.  In the last stall stands Wade in his rapid-
        fire mode.  Holding a mere .38.  BAM!  BAM!  BAM!  BAM!
        Five shots.  All around the bull's eye.  Gun play stops.
        Cops at the end stall staring at Wade's handiwork.

                                 WADE
                    I'm a little rusty.

        Wade lets another ONE fly.  This one hits the bull's eye
        dead center.

                                 WADE
                    Not bad for a bus driver.

        <u>EXT.  MOTORPOOL</u>

        Wade passes a long stretch of cruisers.  Unmarked.  Marked.
        Cops going in.  Cops going out.  Standing beside an unmarked
        cruiser, carrying an array of crime-fighting gizmos is
        Officer Sanchez.  Wade approaches.

                                 WADE
                    You my partner?

                                 WADE
                           (interrupts)
                    Are you a cop?

                                 SANCHEZ
                    Yes.

                                 WADE
                    Well, that's good enough for me.

        Wade crosses over to the driver's door.

                                 WADE (CONT'D)
                    I drive.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    Commissioner Gallagher gave me specific
                    orders not to let you drive until you
                    re-familiarize yourself with the process
                    and territory.

                                 WADE
                    I'm ready.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    But Sergeant...

                                 WADE
                    Give me a break, Sanchez.  It's like
                    riding a bike.

        Sanchez step into the cruiser.

        <u>INT.  WADE'S UNMARKED CRUISER</u>

        To Wade's surprise the dash is entirely computerized.
        Lights.  Screens.  Technocop.  Seat belts automatically
        snap in place.

                                 WADE
                    How do you start this thing?

        Sanchez punches a code into the ignition and the CRUISER
        ROARS INTO LIFE.

                                 WADE
                    Does it drive itself, too?

                                 SANCHEZ
                    You have to use the steering wheel
                    to turn.  The pedal for gas...

                                 WADE
                    Got it.
                           (forefinger reaches a
                            red button)
                    Ejection seat?

                                 SANCHEZ
                           (pulling Wade's hand away)
                    Whoa.  Don't touch that.  <u>Pursuit</u>
                    <u>Mode</u>.

                                 WADE
                    Lean year for role models.

        <u>EXT.  MOTORPOOL</u>

        The CRUISER peels out backwards.  Spins around forward and
        BLASTS onto the streets.

        <u>INT.  WADE'S UNMARKED CRUISER</u>

        Wade re-familiarizing himself with driving.  Sanchez holding
        on for dear life.

                                 WADE
                    And you were worried.

        <u>INT.  SALVATION ARMY MISSION (HOLLYWOOD)</u>

        Street people feast on soup and bread.  In the far corner
        of the room sits a psycho.  A CLOSER look REVEALS Doucet.
        All alone at a huge table.  A Bag Man carries his tray and
        readies to sit down close by.  One look at Doucet and the
        Bag Man chooses to eat elsewhere.

        <u>INT.  WADE'S UNMARKED CRUISER</u>

                                 WADE
                    I have to go home, Sanchez.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    Commissioner Gallagher said...
                           (glances at Wade)
                    ...twenty years is a long time.

        Wade's eyes remain glued to the road.

                                 WADE
                    No offense, but why'd they partner
                    me with a rookie?

                                 SANCHEZ
                    Doucet killed my partner.

        Wade glances back.

                                 WADE
                    I'm sorry.

        Wade sees something.  He pulls to the curb.  Stares off
        into the distance.  He turns off the ignition.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    What is it?

        WADE'S POV THROUGH WINDSHIELD

        Two TECHNOTHUGS.  Sitting in a dented late model.  No
        plates.  Parked across from a Security Pacific.

        BACK TO SCENE

                                 WADE
                    See those guys?

                                 SANCHEZ
                           (looking out)
                    Technothugs.

        Wade looks confused.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    Urban Warriors.

        Still confused.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    Bad dudes.

        Sanchez brings the lingo down to Wade's day.

                                 WADE
                    They're going to rob that bank.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    How do you know?

                                 WADE
                    Some things never change.

        Sanchez is impressed.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    I'll inform dispatch.

                                 WADE
                    There's no time.  There are civilians
                    in there.  It's about to go down.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    We don't know that for sure.  We'll
                    have to wait until they move.

                                 WADE
                    Well, I'm sure.  You're a cop.  I'm
                    a cop.  Let's do what cops do.

        Wade moves.  Sanchez grabs his arm.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    Wait.

        Sanchez quickly punches letters and numbers into the on-
        board computer.  Wade watches Sanchez, confused.  A blueprint
        of the Security Pacific appears on the monitor.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    There are three entrances to the bank.
                    Main.  Back emergency and an air con
                    vent on the roof...
                           (punches more info
                            into the computer)
                    ...I'll punch in the COMMTRACK <u>suspect</u>
                    <u>apprehend program</u>, and...
                           (turns to Wade, proud)
                    ...I'll have a proposed plan of assault
                    and arrest in about thirty seconds.

        Wade grimaces.  Checks the rounds in his .38.

                                 WADE
                           (impatient)
                    I'll be right back.

        The on-board dash monitor comes to life.  Gallagher on
        line.  Wade sits tight.

                                 GALLAGHER (V.O.)
                    Doucet's just offed two of the jurors
                    who put him away.  I'm rounding up
                    the rest of them and putting them in
                    police custody.  What's your status?

                                 SANCHEZ
                    We seem to've come across a 211, sir.

                                 GALLAGHER (V.O.)
                    Forget it.  Stick to the program.

        Wade reaches for the monitor.  Shuts it off.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    You can't turn him off.  He's the
                    Commissioner.

                                 WADE
                    I'm not fond of television comedies.

        Wade reaches for the door.  Back to business.

                                 WADE
                    Wanna come?

                                 SANCHEZ
                    My insurance won't cover it.

        Wade shakes his head.  Crosses the boulevard over to the
        bank.  Alone.

        <u>INT.  SECURITY PACIFIC</u>

        Six customers.  Three Tellers.  Two Assistant Managers.
        Wade enters and crosses over to a FEMALE TELLER.

                                 FEMALE TELLER
                    Hi, can I help you?

        <u>EXT.  SECURITY PACIFIC</u>

        The Two Technothugs step out of their car and cross over to
        the bank.  They are cautious.  One's name is NARVELLE.  The
        other is WIGGINS.

        <u>INT.  WADE'S UNMARKED CRUISER</u>

        Sanchez is keeping an eye on the suspects and one on the
        monitor.  The digital display reads:

        <u>INT.  SECURITY PACIFIC</u>

        Narvelle and Wiggins bolt through the doors and whip out
        their AUTOMAG 754s.  Each has a flaming skull tattoo on
        his right hand.

                                 WIGGINS
                    Okay, everyone hit the fuck'n floor!

        People scream.

                                 WIGGINS
                    Now!

        People hit the floor.  Narvelle BLOWS AWAY the surveillance
        cameras.

                                 NARVELLE
                           (maniacal laugh)
                    We're gonna do some bank'n!

        Wiggins holds up a miniature electronic device.

        He charges toward a TELLER.

                                 WIGGINS
                    Open the safe!

                    So get me the fuck'n manager.

        The Teller reaches for an intercom button.

                                 WIGGINS
                           (cocking his gun)
                    Aaaah!

                                 TELLER
                    It's an intercom.

                                 WIGGINS
                    I'll blow your head off, if it ain't.

        Wiggins depresses the intercom switch.

                                 WIGGINS
                    Mr. Manager, get the fuck out here.
                    We're having a little party, and
                    <u>you're</u> invited.

        Wade steps out of the back office.  Suit.  Tie.  He could
        be the manager, but we know better.

                                 WADE
                           (nonchalant)
                    There's no party.  You lied.

        Silence.  Wiggins looks to his buddy.  Is this guy for real?

                                 WIGGINS
                    Open the fuck'n safe before I get
                    angry.

        Wade raises his hands in the air.

                                 WADE
                    Just don't hurt anybody.

                                 WIGGINS
                    That all depends on you.
                           (to his Buddy)
                    Go with him.

        Wade leads Narvelle to the safe, situated in the back of
        the bank.

                                 WIGGINS
                    You got one minute.

        Wade and Narvelle disappear FROM VIEW.  They approach the
        safe.  Wade punches numbers into the coded lock.  The door
        doesn't budge.

                                 NARVELLE
                    Hurry up!

        With blinding speed, Wade back-elbows Narvelle in the
        breastbone with pile-driver force.  The winded recipient
        falls cold.  Wade removes the clip from the Auto Mag and
        tosses it aside.  Casually he walks back into the bank
        foyer.

                                 WIGGINS
                    Hey, what the fuck's going on here?
                    Where's the other guy?

                                 WADE
                    Grabbed some cash and hightailed it out
                    the back door.  Wasn't that your plan?

                                 WIGGINS
                    Shit'n skunk...

        Wiggins races, full steam towards the safe.  As he passes
        Wade, he is introduced to his forearm, full force.  Wiggins
        staggers.  Drops his Auto Mag, and falls.  He quickly rises
        and gets into a major karate pose.  Perhaps even Ninjutsu.
        It's something weird.

                                 WIGGINS
                    You fuck'd with the wrong guy, slosh
                    monkey.  I'm going to drop your sorry
                    ass.

        Wade mimics the phrase 'slosh monkey' silently.  It makes
        no sense.  Wiggins screams and charges.

        <u>EXT.  SECURITY PACIFIC</u>

        Wiggins flies through the window like a rock in a shower of
        GLASS SPLINTERS.  Wade crosses through the window wreckage
        instead of using the door.  Sanchez runs forward and draws
        his ZV6 handgun.  He's pumped.  Adrenaline-high.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    You're under arrest.

        Sanchez thrives on action.  Cruisers pull up.  Cops
        surround the Technothug.  Wade heads for his unmarked
        cruiser.  Sanchez darts to Wade.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    Alright!  You did good.  Double hand
                    me.

        Wade doesn't understand.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    Double hand me.

        Sanchez demonstrates the futuristic high five.  Almost like
        a child's patty cake.

        <u>INT.  WADE'S UNMARKED CRUISER</u>

        Wade climbs in.  Sanchez takes the passenger seat.  Once
        again, the monitor lights up.  Gallagher on line.  Pissed
        off.

                                 GALLAGHER (V.O.)
                    You two fucks listen up.  Doucet's
                    killing people and you're wasting
                    valuable time busting two-bit
                    Technothugs.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    But sir, Sergeant Wade saved the
                    hostages.

                                 GALLAGHER (V.O.)
                    I'm thrilled beyond belief.

        He's one sarcastic S.O.B.  A MONTAGE of forensic photos
        pass the screen.  The two jurors lie dead.

                                 GALLAGHER (V.O.)
                    Take a good look at these.  The one
                    on the right used to be a woman.

        The pix stop.  Gallagher comes on.

                                 GALLAGHER (V.O.)
                    She's left behind three kids and no
                    husband.  You know what that means?
                    Taxpayers are going to foot the bill
                    'til they grow up.  That's money out
                    of your pocket, Sanchez.

        This is too much.  Gallagher is a warped man.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    Sir, your transmission's fading.

                                 GALLAGHER (V.O.)
                    What the hell are you talking about?

        Sanchez gestures.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    We can't hear you.

        Wade turns to Sanchez.  A look of respect.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    Your picture's fading.

        Sanchez turns off the monitor.  He and Wade exchange smiles.

        <u>EXT.  HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD</u>

        Wade stands by a COMPUPHONE.  His cruiser parked along the
        curb.  Sanchez is out of sight.  An OPERATOR appears on the
        liquid screen.

                                 WADE
                    Cassy Wade.

                                 OPERATOR (V.O.)
                    Would you like me to connect you?

        Wade's mind races.

                                 OPERATOR (V.O.)
                    Would you like me to connect you?

                                 WADE
                    Yeah.

                                 OPERATOR (V.O.)
                    Ringing.

        Wade takes a deep breath.

        <u>INT.  SUBURBAN SPLIT LEVEL (VALLEY)</u>

        The TELEPHONE RINGS.  Cassy crosses the living room.
        Switches it on.  The screen lights up.

        INTERCUT AS NEEDED WITH:  Wade panics.  Ducks out of sight.
        Breathing heavy.  Afraid.  Cassy appears on screen.  Smiles.

                                 CASSY
                    Hello.

        Wade flattens himself against the side of the Compuphone
        booth.

                                 CASSY
                    Hello?  Is anyone there?

        Cassy glances around.  All she can see is the street.

        Wade desperately tries to take a step in front of the
        Compuphone.  He can't.  He closes his eyes.  He hasn't heard
        his wife's voice in twenty years.  It's just too much.

                                 CASSY
                    Hello?

        Wade can't take it any more.  He reaches around the
        Compuphone and hangs up.

        <u>EXT.  HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD</u>

        A CLEANSWEEP (Robotic Sidewalk Cleaner) moves towards the
        Compuphone.

                                 CLEANSWEEP (V.O.)
                           (male voice)
                    Please step aside... Please step
                    aside...

        Cleansweep passes people who taunt it, but step out of
        its way.  Wade doesn't see it as he steps out of the
        Compuphone.

                                 CLEANSWEEP (V.O.)
                    Please step aside...

        Wade turns towards the voice pattern.  He is startled by the
        mechanical figure bearing down on him.  He jumps out
        of the way as it passes.

        Sanchez walks up holding two bags of food.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    I had to go to three places to
                    find someone who'd make a bacon
                    cheeseburger.

        Sanchez hands Wade his bag.  Wade removes the burger and
        takes a major bite.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    Get with it, Wade.  Beef is bad.
                    Not to mention the nitrates from
                    the pig.  You're bucking for some
                    major cardiovascular problems.

        Sanchez opens his bag and takes a bite of his vegiroll with
        puree beet sauce.  Wade looks on.  Beet sauce dribbles down
        Sanchez's chin.  Wade hands him a napkin.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    Thanks.  Want'a bite?  McDonald's
                    vegiroll.

                                 WADE
                    Pass.

        Sanchez stops eating.  Gets serious.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    Can I ask you something?

                                 WADE
                    Yes.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    When you're frozen, you're legally
                    dead, right?

        Wade nods.  Sanchez points to his brain.

                                 SANCHEZ (CONT'D)
                    Then what goes on in there?  What I
                    mean is, what are you thinking about?

                                 WADE
                           (in between bites)
                    Bacon cheeseburgers.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    Give me a break.  I'm serious.
                    What's it like to be dead?

                                 WADE
                    Trust me.  You don't want to know.

        A car parallel parks directly in front of Wade's cruiser.
        It also blocks a fire hydrant.  The driver's door opens.
        The hydrant voice modulator is activated.

                                 FIRE HYDRANT (V.O.)
                           (from voice modulator)
                    You are in direct violation of Municipal
                    Ordinance 90l3-CF.  Obstructing

                    feet.  You have twenty-five seconds
                    to remove your vehicle.  If you do
                    not comply, a parking infraction will
                    be recorded and issued.

        The Driver high-tails it into a Dry Cleaners.

                                 WADE
                           (calling out after
                            the Driver)
                    Hey, buddy...

                                 SANCHEZ
                    Relax, let technology do the work.

                                 FIRE HYDRANT (V.O.)
                    ...Municipal Ordinance 90l3-CF was
                    passed in the mid-twentieth century...

        The Driver darts out of the Dry Cleaners carrying his
        laundry.  He dashes to his car.

                                 HYDRANT (V.O.)
                    ...Thank you for obeying the law.
                    Drive carefully.

        The look on Wade's face is unbelievable.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    You win some, you lose some.

        Sanchez snickers at his joke.  Wade doesn't.  Sanchez
        punches more numbers and letters into the computer.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    NPA metamorphosis should biologically
                    slow him down.  That's when we'll get

                    You can't catch this man with a

                    what has to be dane.

        Sanchez is impressed.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    Sir, I took the liberty of running
                    a GCI scenario on a TM-1 earlier

        Sanchez wants to know why he went dirty.  You can see it on
        his face.

                    You're saying you were put away for

                    a badass named Dubbs.  He was going
                    to turn me onto the big man.  He made
                    me for a cop.  Mysteriously my fellow
                    officers discovered ten pounds of
                    heroin in my cruiser.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    It doesn't make sense.  Who would
                    want to do that to you?

                                 WADE
                    Nothing makes sense when you're a cop.

        Wade takes a deep breath.  Sanchez shuts up.

                                 WADE
                    Married?

                                 SANCHEZ
                    Engaged.  Plan on doing it this
                    summer.  You still married?

                                 WADE
                    Yeah.  Least I think so.  Twenty-
                    six years this March.

        Wade's in his early thirties.  He removes an old, crumpled
        snapshot from his pocket.  This thing looks like it went
        through the wash.  Probably frozen with him.  He unfolds
        it.  It is a photo of Wade, Cassy and Kimberly at Disney-
        land.  A great family photo.  Wade shows the photo to
        Sanchez.

                                 WADE
                    It's good to be married.

        Wade pulls up to a stretch of land stationed between apart-
        ment buildings in various stages of development.  This is
        the land the old run-down projects sat on.

        Across the street, wrecking crews sit idle for the night in
        front of buildings scheduled for demolition.  Wade stops,
        steps out and crosses over to a chain link fence.  Sanchez
        follows.

                    What's this place?

                                 WADE
                    This is where I found Doucet twenty
                    years ago.  Thought maybe he'd come
                    back.

        A pain thunders through his leg.  He grabs it.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    You okay?

        Wade looks up.

                                 WADE
                    Yeah.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    Hey, Rip Van Winkle, maybe we'd
                    better call it a night.

        Wade smiles at the reference.

        <u>INT.  SANCHEZ'S APARTMENT - DEN</u>

        Wade glances around the room.  Picks up a framed holograph
        photo of Sanchez and his gal.  Sanchez walks into the room,
        loaded with a blanket, pillows and sheets.

                                 WADE
                    She's pretty.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    Thanks.

        He opens the couch and unfolds the hide-a-bed.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    She's back East visiting her mother 
                    for two weeks.

        Sanchez places BioBears sheets on the bed.  BioBears are
        cartoon characters.  Shaped like bears.  Named after body
        parts.  Furry friends like Larry Legs, Ernie Eyes and
        Harriet Heart.  Wade smiles.

                                 WADE
                    Nice sheets.

        Sanchez laughs.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    I've had these ever since I was a kid.
                    Last thing my father bought for me before
                    he died.  I guess they've got
                    some sort of sentimental value.

        Sanchez finishes the bed.  Lays down the pillows.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    You need anything else?

                                 WADE
                    I'll be okay.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    Good night, Wade.

                                 WADE
                    Good night.

        Sanchez leaves the room.  Wade takes off his shirt.  Lays
        it down on a chair.  Reaches into his pocket and pulls
        out the weathered photo of his family.  Stares at it for
        a brief moment.  Places it beside the bed.  Removes his
        pants, turns off the light, and climbs into bed wearing
        only his underwear.  He's uncomfortable.  For twenty years
        he's stood upright.  His body is not used to comfort.

        Sanchez appears.  Switches on the light.  He and Wade swap
        stares.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    You did good today.

        <u>EXT.  HOLLYWOOD - ALLEYWAY</u>

        A thin stream of garbage lined back street, half-lit by
        the moon.  Defaced by "Technothugs Rule" graffiti.  Torn
        holograph campaign posters wallpaper the entrance.
        Gallagher's smiling mug promises: "FIGHTING FOR YOU.
        24 HOURS A DAY".  Two Technothugs rewire the billboard's
        voice modulator.  Gallagher cusses a blue streak.

        A Bag Man rummages through a trash container searching for
        a midnight snack.  In the darkest corners sleep shadows of
        humans brought down to their lowest degree.  They cling to
        sole possessions which include pieces of clothing and empty
        Wild Turkey bottles.  Doucet sleeps with the best of them.
        Half covered in newsprint.  Peaceful.  Curled in a fetal
        position.

        <u>INT.  SANCHEZ'S APARTMENT - DEN</u>

        Wade watching the tube.  Holding the remote.  Flips through
        channels.  Stops at the <u>Playboy</u> holograph station.  A 3-D
        couple are hot and heavy.  Major foreplay.  Wade can't
        believe it.  He feels like a peeping tom.  Shuts off the
        tube.  In the b.g., he hears Sanchez's talking.  He climbs
        out of bed.  Crosses the room and looks into Sanchez's
        kitchen.  Sanchez is on the line.  Muffled voice.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    He's on downtime.  Yes... we're making
                    progress.  He doesn't fit the profile
                    of a bad cop.  Yes sir, I know his
                    record, but... No sir, I won't.

        <u>INT.  GALLAGHER'S STRETCH LIMO</u>

        Gallagher on the horn.  His wife beside him.  Barbara Bush-
        like.  Probably has a great personality.  But that's it.
        She removes her heels and rubs her tired feet.  Both are
        wearing formal wear.  Probably coming from a dinner party.

                                 GALLAGHER
                    Don't be impressed by his little
                    stunt today.  He's a bad apple,
                    Sanchez.  Remember that.

        Limo stops in front of Gallagher's home.  Large and white.
        Beautiful and elegant.  Real Estate Heaven.  Uniformed Cops
        patrol the grounds.  Gallagher cups the receiver.

                                 GALLAGHER
                           (to Wife)
                    I'll be back in a couple hours.  I
                    have to go over my victory speech
                    at the office.

        His wife sighs.  Climbs out.  Gallagher blows her a kiss.

                                 GALLAGHER
                           (to Sanchez)

                    tomorrow.

        <u>INT.  SANCHEZ'S APARTMENT - DEN</u>

        Wade in bed.  Staring off into a blank void.  He can't
        sleep.  He's got a lot of shit on his mind.

        <u>INT.  TOWNHOUSE</u>

        Gallagher stands in front of the vanity.  Snaps on his
        Rolex.  Runs his hands through his sculptured silver hair.
        Smiles.  An after sex smile.

        The MIRROR CATCHES a YOUNG DOLL lying in bed.  You know
        the type.  All curves.  All lips.  Not an MIT graduate.
        Gallagher turns to her.

                                 DOLL
                    You've got my vote, Commissioner.

        <u>EXT.  TOWNHOUSE</u>

        Gallagher's limo sits idle by the curb.  Kai Ling and Dokes
        stand at attention.  Gallagher steps out of the building.
        Glances around.  Adjusts his bow tie.  Moves for the limo.

        <u>INT.  SANCHEZ'S KITCHEN</u>

        Rise and shine.  Sanchez sets down two complete break-
        fasts.  The health-conscious kind.  Wade walks in.
        Groggy.  Knuckles the sleep from his eyes.  Coughs.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    Good morning, partner.  Take a
                    seat.  I made you breakfast.

        Sanchez offers to pour the juice.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    Juice?

        Wade puts his hand over his cup.

                                 WADE
                    I'll have a cup of coffee?

                                 SANCHEZ
                    Never use it.  Stuff'll kill ya.

        An "oh great" look passes Wade's face.  Sanchez pours.
        Wade takes his seat.  Sanchez chows down.  Wade looks at
        his own plate and sighs.
                                 WADE
                    The breakfast of crime fighters.

        He picks up his toast and dips it into his juice.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    I've been doing a little thinking.
                    Medicomp's come out with an MRI
                    scanner.  You know what that means?

        Wade obviously doesn't.

                                 WADE
                    No.  Talk English.  Then I'll understand.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    We get to peek into Doucet's brain.

                                 WADE
                    Hey, I'm eating.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    I'm serious, Wade.  This case is
                    important to me.

                                 WADE
                    You want to be a good detective?

                                 SANCHEZ
                    Yes, sir.

                                 WADE
                    Then find me some cigarettes.

        <u>EXT.  BAR</u>

        A DRUNK MAN climbs into his grey Saab.

        Drunk hits the dash and curses.  Suddenly the door whips
        open and two hands reach in.  Big ones.  Doucet's meat
        hooks.  They rip the Drunk out.  Steal his wallet.  Doucet
        gets in.

                                 VOICE MODULATOR (V.O.)
                    That's better.  Drive carefully.

        Smoke.  Rubber.  History.

        Sanchez and a Technothug.  Exchanging cash for what looks
        like drugs.  After the transaction, the Rookie heads for
        the cruiser at the of the alley.

        <u>INT.  WADE'S UNMARKED CRUISER</u>

        Sanchez hops in.  Tosses two cigarettes at Wade.

                                 WADE
                    Two lousy smokes.  You're a real
                    sport.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    That cost me two weeks' pay.

        Wade shoves one in his mouth.  He smiles like a kid in a
        candy store.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    I shouldn't have done this.  I
                    could lose my badge.

        Wade looks for the cigarette lighter.  Sanchez fights with
        his conscience.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    Maybe I should turn myself in.

                                 WADE
                    Lighten up.  You're going to give
                    yourself an ulcer.

        He can't find the lighter.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    Detroit stopped putting cigarette
                    lighters in years ago.  Same time
                    smoking was banned.

        A "swell" look sweeps Wade's face.

        <u>EXT.  SUNSHINE MOTEL (HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD)</u>

        A sleazebag roach house in the heart of Hollywood.

        <u>INT.  SUNSHINE MOTEL</u>

        Doucet stands at the front desk.  Face filmed in sweat.
        Clutching his wrist.  He's in pain.  In the b.g., an
        ELDERLY GENT wears liquid screen glasses tuned to
        'Jeopardy' with Alex Trabek, Jr.  The DESK CLERK hands
        Doucet back his credit card.  Yeah sure, like this maniac
        really has credit.

                                 CLERK
                    Here you go, Mr. Firestone.
                           (places the receipt
                            in front of Doucet)
                    Sign here.

        Doucet signs.  Sloppily.  His hand trembles.

                                 CLERK
                    You okay?
                           (hands over the
                            keys; points)
                    Up the stairs to the left.  Room 27.
                    I'd go see a doctor if I were you.

        Doucet pivots and marches toward the stairs.

        <u>INT.  ROOM 27</u>

        The door opens.  Doucet staggers into the room.  Closes the
        door and locks it.  He removes his weapons from under his
        jacket and lays them on the bed.  Suddenly his knees buckle
        and arms go limp.  He covers his face with his hands and
        withers in pain.  Mild atrophy sets in, causing greying
        and bald spots.  Loss and degeneration of elastic tissue
        cause wrinkles and dilation in blood vessels.  He's aging
        and he doesn't know it.

        Wade with a cigarette in his mouth.  Cruiser hood open.
        He tries to spark the battery to light the sucker.  Sanchez

                    response to outside stimuli.  Com-

                    needs cops when you've got gizmos.

                                 SANCHEZ
                           (re: MEDICOMP)
                    You're just afraid to use this.  You
                    have technophobia, Wade.  That's what
                    you got.

        Wade shoots Sanchez a look.  This is an unbelievable look.
        The one you give someone if you think they're crazy.

                                 SANCHEZ
                           (offers MEDICOMP)
                    If you're not afraid, then go ahead.
                    Let's see you use this thing.  It's
                    user friendly.

        Wade's frustrated.  He turns to Sanchez.

                                 WADE
                    You want to see science?v I'll show
                    you science.

        He removes his .38.

                                 WADE
                    This is science.  Six tries.  If you
                    calculate correctly, one is all you'll
                    need.

        He flips the gun back into the holster.

                                 WADE
                    And it doesn't need batteries.

        He sticks his head back under the hood.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    Dinosaurs are extinct because they
                    couldn't adapt.

        Wade laughs.  Sparks the battery.

                                 WADE
                    Here we go.  Now we're cookin'.

        He lights his smoke.  Takes a long drag.  A big ass smile
        on his face.  Sanchez looks at him weird.

                                 WADE
                    Wanna try?

                                 SANCHEZ
                    No thank you, sir.  Smoking causes
                    lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema,
                    and may complicate pregnancy.

                                 WADE
                    You're not pregnant, are you?

                                 SANCHEZ
                    No, sir.

        Wade offers the smoke.

                                 WADE
                    Then g'head.  Live on the wild
                    side.  I won't tell anyone.

        Sanchez gives in.  Glances around to make sure the coast is
        clear.  Takes the smoke and inhales.  He quickly spits out
        the smoke and coughs.  Wade laughs.

                                 WADE
                    Not bad, huh?

        Sanchez is doing some minor choking.  Wade pats him on the
        back.

                                 SANCHEZ
                           (sarcastic)
                    Great.

        DISPATCH SQUAWKS.  Sanchez goes for it.  Wade enjoys the
        smoke.  Sanchez reappears.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    Let's roll.  We got a guy who
                    swears his car was stolen by a
                    suspect identical to Doucet.
                    0800 this morning.

                                 WADE
                    What else did he get?

                                 SANCHEZ
                    Wallet, cash, I.D...

                                 WADE
                           (re: computer)
                    Fire up that thing of yours and
                    tell me all credit card trans-
                    actions after eight o'clock.

        Sanchez works his Cop Computer.  Wade watches.  He can't
        hide his obvious fascination with the gadget.  The screen
        lights up.  Sanchez reads the info.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    Bull's eye.  One transaction...
                    Sunshine Motel.  Hollywood.
                    After the eleven-hundred hour.

        Wade tosses his smoke.  Slams the hood down.  Both
        hop into the cruiser.

        <u>INT.  SUNSHINE MOTEL - SECOND FLOOR</u>

        Sheppard and Underhill are led to Room 27 by the Clerk,
        Sheppard carries a double barrel riot gun.  Underhill a
        Thermograph monitor.

                                 CLERK
                    We get all kinds here, but this
                    guy's major psycho.
                           (points to Room 27)
                    He's in here.

        Sheppard knocKs on the door with the riot gun.

        <u>INT.  BATHROOM - ROOM 27</u>

        Doucet faces the broken bathroom mirror.  An old weathered
        <u>Los Angeles Times</u> newspaper headline hangs at eye level.
        You've seen the one.  Headline reads:  "HERO COP NABS
        SERIAL MURDERER."  Smaller headline reads:  "DEMOLITION MAN
        GETS HIS MAN."  The words: DEMOLITION MAN have been circled
        numerous times.  To a point where the paper's torn.

                                 SHEPPARD (V.O.)
                    Open up.

        Doucet turns from the mirror.  His face is a shock at
        first.  He looks older.  About five years.  Streaks of
        grey.  Receding hairline.  A couple wrinkles.  He doesn't
        look so good.  Matter of fact, he looks terrified.  He
        doesn't know what's happening to his body.

                                 DOUCET
                    Go away!

                                 SHEPPARD (V.O.)
                    This is the police.  Open up.

        <u>INT.  SUNSHINE MOTEL - SECOND FLOOR</u>

        In a Thermograph outline we see Doucet cross the room and
        pick up a large weapon from the bed.  If this were a video
        game it would be fun.  But it's not.

                                 UNDERHILL
                           (holding Thermograph)
                    Jesus, he's got a gu---

        BAM!  Underhill is smashed backwards as the door to Room 27
        is ripped apart.  He hits the back wall and slides to the
        ground.  His jacket and shirt torn to shreds, revealing
        behind a bulletproof vest of KEVLAR IV.  Sheppard and the
        Clerk are thrown down the corridor by the blast.

                                 SHEPPARD
                    Are you all right?

                                 UNDERHILL
                    I'm okay.

        Underhill spoke too soon.  Doucet steps out of the wreckage
        and POPS a COUPLE ROUNDS into Underhill's head.  Doucet
        does an about-face.  The Clerk storms towards the stairs.
        Sheppard FIRES.  Doucet FIRES.  Sheppard is thrown backwards
        in the air, landing on the Clerk running down the
        stairs.  Clerk screams and pushes the Cop's body off his
        back.  Doucet down the stairs two at a time.  Snarling with
        hostility.

        Elderly Gent oblivious.  Now watching: "I LOVE ROCKY" --
        The Sitcom.  Soundtrack as follows:  "Pound for pound
        he's number one/Now he's got a wife and a newborn son/New
        opponents every week/Trying to knock Rocky off his peak."

        Clerk races for the front door.  Doucet FIRES.

        <u>EXT.  SUNSHINE MOTEL</u>

        The Clerk hits glass door.  Slumps to the ground, dead.

        <u>INT.  WADE'S UNMARKED CRUISER</u>

        Approaches the Sunshine Motel.  Doucet jackrabbits into the
        Saab.

                                 WADE
                    That's Doucet.

        Sanchez brings up lights.  Doucet pulls away from the
        curb.  Shoots by the Cops.

        <u>INT.  SAAB</u>

        Doucet does a double-take.  Adjusts his rearview mirror.
        Yup, it's Wade back there.  Doucet smiles.

                    Kid, you ever been in a high speed

                    Simulated one.

        <u>EXT.  HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD</u>

        The sky darkens as storm clouds gather ominously.
        Lightning crackles.  THUNDER ROARS.  Cruiser and Saab
        ROAR through the street neons at 80 mph+.  Lights
        stretching and twisting.

        <u>INT.  SAAB</u>

        Power-driven by Doucet with no regard to fellow drivers.

        <u>EXT.  RESIDENTIAL SIDE STREET</u>

        Saab tears around a corner.  Cruiser close behind.  A TRUCK
        slowly makes its way up the street.  The Saab hops the
        sidewalk and plows through a garden.  Cruiser follows.

        <u>EXT.  SUNSET BOULEVARD</u>

        Slowing a traffic light, the Saab causes on-coming traffic
        to break suddenly.  Fender bender time.

        <u>INT.  WADE'S UNMARKED CRUISER</u>

        Wade driving hard.

        Wade pulls Sanchez close and twists the headset towards
        him.

                                 WADE

        Saab is cut off.  Plows into a grocery store.

        <u>INT.  WADE'S UNMARKED CRUISER</u>

        Wade puts the pedal to the metal.  Towards the grocery
        store's new entrance.  A look of stark terror sweeps
        Sanchez's face.

                                 WADE
                    It's all right.  I've done this before.

        <u>EXT.  GROCERY STORE</u>

        Wade's cruiser speeds in.

        <u>INT.  GROCERY STORE</u>

        Cruiser tailgates the Saab.  Fruits and veggies splatter
        all over the place.  Wade hits the windshield wipers.
        Shoppers run.

        <u>EXT.  GROCERY STORE</u>

        Saab rockets out.  Airborne over the sidewalk.  Slides into
        a parked car.  ENGINE STALLS.  CRUISER SCREECHES to a stop.

        <u>INT.  WADE'S UNMARKED CRUISER</u>

                                 SANCHEZ

        Sanchez hops out.

                                 WADE
                    Get back in the car.

        <u>EXT.  STREET</u>

        Sanchez races.  Weapon drawn.  Saab FIRES UP.  Peels out
        in reverse.  Sanchez lashes out and grabs the tail fin.
        Doucet puts it in drive and races away.  Dragging Sanchez.
        Feet dangling at 65 mph.  Boot leather being torn to
        shreds.

        He grabs a headset and hits the gas.

        <u>EXT.  STREET</u>

        Car swerves.  Sanchez hangs on for dear life.  His radio
        headset squawks.

                                 WADE (V.O.)
                    Get the fuck off his car, Sanchez.
                    Let go of it.

        Sanchez loses his grip.  One hand whips back.  The other
        one holds on to the fin.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    We're bringing him down, partner.
                    You and I.

        The back WINDOW SHATTERS.  Diced to smithereens.  Doucet is
        one talented dude.  Drives with one hand.  FIRES with the
        other.

        <u>INT.  WADE'S UNMARKED CRUISER</u>

                                 WADE
                    You're going to get yourself killed.
                    Let him go.

        Sanchez reaches up with his free hand and locks onto the
        fin.  Glass skates across the trunk.  Cutting his fingers.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    We're going to be heroes.

        Suddenly the Saab power brakes.  Sanchez is thrown through
        the open back window -- across the seats and through the
        front window.  He somersaults to the asphalt.

        <u>INT.  WADE'S UNMARKED CRUISER</u>

                    Nooooooo!

        <u>EXT.  STREET</u>

        Doucet drives off.  Wade skids to a stop.  Door flings
        open.  He jumps out and kneels beside Sanchez.  The
        Rookie's covered in blood.  Wade tries to revive him --
        CPR style.

                                 WADE
                    Live... C'mon... Live... Goddamn it.

        Sanchez coughs.  Spits up blood.  Comes to.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    Did we get him?

        Wade breathes a sigh of relief.

                                 WADE
                    Not yet.  Sit tight.  Help's on the
                    way.

        Wade takes Sanchez's gun.  He's crazed.  Ready to erupt.

                                 WADE

        The cruiser approaches.

        <u>INT.  WADE'S UNMARKED CRUISER</u>

        Wade struggles with the wheel, in a desperate attempt to
        avoid the feline.  Monitor beside display screen.  Simu-
        lated cat on screen.  Display reads:

                           <u>CAT</u>
                    Domesticated animal of the Feline Family.

                    Code 34-R

        CAT HISSES.  Auto-piloted cruiser comes within a hair,
        swerves around and continues its pursuit.  The cat con-
        tinues on its way.

        <u>EXT.  HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD</u>

        The rain falls harder and steadier.  The chase becomes more
        intense.  On sidewalks.  Sideswiping cars.  Through crowded
        intersections.  Left on a red.  Anything to break the law.
        Popeye Doyle would be proud of these two.

        A TRAFFIC LIGHT changes from red to green.  A swarm of cars
        cross.  Saab rushes in, swerving to avoid them.  Spin out.
        Once.  Twice.  Three times.  Finally crashing through the
        glass doors of a Hollywood office building.  Five stories.
        More grit than glamour.

        <u>INT.  OFFICE BUILDING - LOBBY</u>

        The Saab sits atop a pile of glass, twisted metal, and
        broken concrete.  Demolition smoke fills the air.  The
        cruiser plows in, rear-ending the Saab.

        <u>INT.  WADE'S UNMARKED CRUISER</u>

        Pursuit Mode shuts down.  Display screen flashes:

                           SUSPECT VEHICLE APPREHENDED
                           87Y99043--GTS43
                           Proceed with caution.

        <u>INT.  LOBBY</u>

        Doucet emerges, moving fast.  All business.  He FIRES at
        Wade.  Wade ducks under the dash.  Doucet quickly runs out
        of ammunition.  Wade rises and FIRES through the shattered
        windshield.

        Elevator doors open.  Three Executives rush to close it.
        Doucet races forward.  Boots crunching through broken
        glass.  Execs run out.  Doucet steps in and the doors
        close.  Wade exits his cruiser and marches over to the
        elevators.

        <u>INT.  ELEVATOR</u>

        Doucet leans back, catching his breath and restoring his
        senses.

        <u>INT.  LOBBY</u>

        Wade empties a COUPLE ROUNDS into the elevator button
        panel, blowing it out of commission.

        <u>INT.  ELEVATOR</u>

        The elevator jolts and stops.  Llghts out.  SMASH!  Doucet
        punches off the emergency hatch and climbs up.

        <u>INT.  LOBBY</u>

        With desperation strength, Wade pulls open the second
        elevator door.

        <u>INT.  ELEVATOR SHAFT</u>

        Doucet pulls himself up the steel cables.  His bare hands
        quickly being cut up.  Below Wade FIRES.  BAM!  BAM!  BAM!
        The last bullet hits Doucet in the shoulder.  He momen-
        tarily releases his grip on one hand and falls a few feet.
        He snarls.  His shoulder aching and bloody.  Wade grabs
        the cables and climbs.  Doucet regains his strength and
        continues climbing.  Below, Wade gains on him.

        <u>INT.  FIFTH FLOOR</u>

        Doucet pulls himself up with one hand.  Blood seeps from
        his bullet wound.  He kneels for a moment restoring his
        senses.  He looks down into the shaft and sees Wade
        climbing.  Doucet rises and removes a fire extinguisher
        from the wall.  He crosses back to the elevator shaft
        and hurtles the canister down.

        <u>INT.  ELEVATOR SHAFT</u>

        The fire extinguisher falls like a cannonball.  It hits
        Wade hard in the upper body.  He slips, reaches for support
        and clambers onto another cable.  He draws his gun and
        carefully re-loads, using his body as a vise.  He FIRES
        upwards, but Doucet backs away.

        <u>EXT.  FIFTH FLOOR</u>

        Wade drags himself up.  He rises and races for the stair-
        well.

        <u>INT.  STAIRWELL</u>

        BAM!  Wade enters fast.  The door to the roof slams shut.
        Wade darts up the stairs.

        <u>EXT.  ROOF</u>

        Wade kicks the door open and enters, .38 drawn.  Doucet
        climbs off the roof.  Strung across the building to a
        lower three story complex is heavy rope used for cable
        extensions.  Doucet uses his gun as a pulley-sheave over
        the rope.  Grasping both ends he slides across.  Wade races
        over to the ledge.  Below is nothing but open space.

        The Tie-post (Five Story Building) rope slowly starts to
        unravel.  Wade uses his jacket as a pulley-sheave and jumps
        off the roof.

        <u>EXT.  ROOF (THREE STORY BUILDING)</u>

        Doucet lands feet first.  Wade follows.  Doucet tries to
        untie the rope from its post.

        <u>EXT.  ROOF (FIVE STORY BUILDING)</u>

        The rope snaps from its tie-post.

        <u>EXT.  OPEN SPACE BETWEEN BUILDINGS</u>

        Wade falls in mid-air.  He continues grasping the line,
        heading feet first towards the three story building wall.

        <u>EXT.  THREE STORY BUILDING</u>

        The speed and strength of the rope is blinding.  It whirls
        around Doucet's right hand, coiling it python-like.  The
        circulation in the limb is quickly cut off.  He is pulled
        to the ledge lassoed by Wade.  His right arm pulled down-
        wards.  This is painful.

        <u>EXT.  THREE STORY BUILDING - WALL</u>

        Wade hangs comfortably from the rope, dangling in mid-air.
        Doucet, however, is in excruciating pain as Wade's body
        weight pulls at his joint.  This is a freak accident.  In
        a vain attempt, Doucet whips down his weapon.  It misses
        Wade and CLATTERS to the ground.  Doucet winces and growls.
        With one hand, Wade removes the PORTABLE POLICE RADIO from
        his belt hook.  He breathes a sigh of relief before speak-
        ing.  The rain continues to pour.

                                 WADE

        <u>EXT.  THREE STORY BUILDING - ROOF</u>

        Doucet reaches down with his left hand and removes a BUCK
        M9 with seven-inch blade from a leather waist sheath.  He
        brings it up and proceeds to cut through the binding rope
        and into his wrist.  Blood geysers.  He shows no pain.
        This is an animal at work.  The rope splits.

        <u>EXT.  WALL</u>

        The rope frees and Wade falls one and a half stories to the
        ground.  He lands hard in a pile of garbage.

        <u>EXT.  THREE STORY BUILDING - ROOF</u>

        Doucet runs across the roof, clutching his wrist.  Blood
        covers his hands.

        <u>EXT.  ALLEYWAY</u>

        Wade dashes out and onto Hollywood Boulevard.

        <u>EXT.  HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD</u>

        Wade races down the street.  Parallel to him, Doucet jumps
        from rooftop to rooftop.  These guys never let up.  The
        rain doesn't bother them and neither does the pain.

        A CROWD of movie-goers bear the weather standing in line
        under a marquee.  Wade charges forward.  He's not changing
        direction for anybody.

                                 WADE
                           (drawing his badge)
                    Move outta the way.  I'm a cop!

        The crowd backs against the wall as this crazy maniac races
        through.  Doucet is still ahead, and much higher up.

        A SEMI brakes hard at a red light.  Wheels lock.  It
        hydroplanes across the boulevard.  Wade slides and skates
        along the ground passing directly under the trailer.  On
        the opposite end, he comes through quick, rises to his feet
        and maintains pursuit.

        The foot-race continues for another quarter mile, until
        suddenly Wade doubles over in pain.  He cries out.  He
        slumps to his knees.  The rain beats down on his face.
        Under a pool of light cast from a lamppost.  Doucet stops.
        He's bleeding bad.  He knows he can't win this way.  He
        looks down and laughs menacingly.  Wade tries to rise, but
        he can't.  He's paralyzed.  A pained look covers his face.
        He's aging.  From late twenties to early thirties.  Couple
        grey hairs.  Small wrinkles.  Doucet races away.  His
        laughing fades on the wind and rain.

                                 WADE
                           (calling out)
                    No matter where you hide, I'm coming
                    after you!

        Wade collapses.  The rain never lets up.  Drops dance on
        his forehead.

        A SIREN WAILS.  BRAKES SQUEAL.  SIREN STOPS.  DOORS SLAM.
        FOOTSTEPS.

        <u>EXT.  HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD</u>

        Images go IN and OUT of FOCUS.  Dizzy, exhausted and
        utterly drained, Wade lies sprawled out in the street.
        A pair of boots stand before him.  The rain has stopped
        and somehow cleansed the streets.  A flashing red light
        reflects off puddles.  Wade looks up.  He squints.  Bennett
        belongs to these boots.  Davidson stands close by.  Their
        cruiser behind.  Lights on.

                                 WADE
                           (disoriented)
                    Sanchez...

                                 BENNETT
                    He's in ICU.  Made it through surgery.
                           (hand extended)
                    Here.

        Sennett helps Wade to his feet.

                                 DAVIDSON
                    Need an ambulance?

        Wade doesn't answer.  Instead, he walks away.  Takes out
        his last smoke.  Raises it to his lips.  Ponders.  Snatches
        it out.  Crumbles it.  Throws it to the ground.  Continues
        walking.  Never looking back.

        <u>EXT.  POLICE STATION</u>

        TWO COPS unload a trio of TECHNOTHUGS from the back of
        their cruiser.  This is not a happy scene.

        <u>INT.  GALLAGHER'S OFFICE</u>

        Gallagher at his desk.  His entourage seated before him.
        The Two Bodyguards close by.  A SALESMAN leans against
        the wall.  They are all listening to a large multi-line
        answering machine called the PSYCHO-TELECOMP.

                                 PSYCHO-TELECOMP

        The Salesman steps forward and shuts off the unit.

                                 SALESMAN
                    Okay.  Now each question is refracted
                    into a set of questions with a voice
                    stress and polygraph analyzer, able
                    to 'talk down' the caller.  Thirty
                    lines.  Seven BCBs.  We're talking
                    state-of-the-art.  More psychologist

                           (pauses for effect)
                    The only thing this baby doesn't
                    have is a diploma.
                           (laughs)
                    I got 'em in New York, Boston,
                    Chicago...

        Bennett steps into the room.  Whispers in Gallagher's ear.

                                 GALLAGHER
                    Not now, I'm busy.

        Bennett continues.  By the reaction on the Commissioner's
        face it's obvious Bennett's just told him about Sanchez's
        death.  Gallagher nods.  He doesn't appear too depressed.
        Bennett leaves the room.  Gallagher smiles.  Turns to the
        Salesman.

                                 GALLAGHER
                    I love it.

                                 SALESMAN
                           (smiles shyly)
                    Classic.  I'll have 'em installed
                    in every precinct by the end of
                    the month.

                                 GALLAGHER
                    Mayor Ray Gallagher.  Good touch.
                    Just don't start 'til tomorrow.
                    I haven't technically won yet.

        He beams.  Winks at Roshko.

                                 SALESMAN
                    Check.

        The Salesman removes the Psycho-Telecomp from Gallagher's
        desk and crosses the room over to the door.

                                 SALESMAN
                    Tomorrow.  Thanks.

        The Salesman leaves.

        Wade walks through.  Silent.  Determined.  He looks like...
        well you can guess.  A few grey hairs.  Tired eyes.  This
        man's a wreck.

        <u>INT.  GALLAGHER'S OFFICE</u>

        Gallagher is signing letters.  His entourage spit out his

        Gallagher looks up.  Everyone turns.

        THEIR POV

        Wade stands at the doorway with his .38 aimed at the
        ready.

        BACK TO SCENE

        Gallagher forces a smile.  His Bodyguards stand at the
        ready.

                                 GALLAGHER
                    Hello Wade.

                                 WADE
                           (to the entourage)
                    Out of the room.

        The entourage looks to Gallagher.  He nods in agreement.
        They leave.  The Bodyguards stay.

                                 WADE
                           (to Gallagher/re:
                            Bodyguards)
                    Tell Frick and Frack that means them
                    too.

                                 GALLAGHER
                           (to the Bodyguards)
                    I'll be alright.

        Bodyguards leave.  Door closes.

                                 GALLAGHER
                    Too bad about Sanchez.

        Wade draws back the hammer.

                                 GALLAGHER
                    You can't kill me.  I'm going to be
                    Mayor tomorrow.

                                 WADE
                    I'm not voting for you.

                                 GALLAGHER
                           (rising)
                    Ah, fuck you, Wade.  This is bull-
                    shit.  You're not going to kill me.
                           (crosses the room)
                    You're not going to risk your freedom.

        Wrong.  Wade F!RES.  The bullet slices by Gallagher
        shattering a picture frame of his family.  Gallagher
        takes a step back.

                                 WADE
                    I want to stop aging.

                                 GALLAGHER
                    And I want Doucet.

        Wade aims the .38 at Gallagher's balls.  This would make a
        man do anything.  Gallagher takes a deep breath.

                                 GALLAGHER
                    You bastard.

        The INTERCOM on Gallagher's desk BUZZES.

                                 PEEBLES (V.O.)
                    Sir, your limo's here.

                                 GALLAGHER
                    Kill me if you want.  Hard line me
                    with that 'I ain't got nothing to
                    lose' bullshit.  But you've got
                    plenty to lose 'partner'.  You've
                    got a family.  I'm giving you a
                    chance to see them.
                           (beat)
                    I kept in touch.  She never married.
                    All these years.  Maybe she loves
                    you.  I wouldn't know why.

        Gallagher crosses the room, heading for the door.  Wade
        lowers his weapon.

                                 GALLAGHER
                    This is a war, Wade.  You against
                    him.  Vengeance time.  The City's
                    just in the way.  Kill the fucker.
                    You and me.  We'll work things out
                    when the time is right.

                                 WADE
                    Remember my promise.

                                 GALLAGHER
                    Don't threaten me.  I tend to take
                    these things seriously.
                           (looks over Wade)
                    And get a couple hours sleep.  You
                    look like day old shit.

                                 WADE
                    Got compliments coming outta your
                    ass, don't ya?

        Gallagher leaves the room.

        <u>INT.  POLICE STATION</u>

        Gallagher crosses over to his entourage.  Without words,
        they automatically turn and walk towards the door.

                                 PEEBLES
                    You okay?

                                 GALLAGHER

        They continue walking.

        <u>EXT.  POLICE STATION</u>

        Gallagher and his entourage step out into a flurry of
        REPORTERS.  Microphones everywhere.

                    stantial lead in the polls?

        Gallagher moves down the steps.

                                 GALLAGHER
                    Delighted.  Good to have the support
                    of the people.

                                 REPORTER #3
                    So it wouldn't be too early to start

                                 GALLAGHER
                    It has a good ring to it, wouldn't
                    you say?

        Gallagher laughs.  His entourage laugh.  Reporters laugh.
        This is mechanical.

                                 GALLAGHER
                    That has been investigated.  We have
                    a suspect and he is being brought

        Gallagher looks to his entourage.  Peebles takes charge.
        Just in time.

                                 PEEBLES
                    Okay, that's all folks.  Commissioner
                    Gallagher has to go.

                                 GALLAGHER
                           (whispers to Peebles)
                    Keep 'em busy.

        Gallagher heads for the limo.  Waves to all.

                                 PEEBLES
                    The Commissioner has asked me to

        Gallagher steps into the limo.

        <u>INT.  POLICE STATION - REFRESHMENT CENTER</u>

        Wade crosses over to SENOR COFFEE, a hi-tech Java machine.
        He deposits a buck in the slot that says to do so.

                                 SENOR COFFEE (V.O.)

                    Make it strong.

        A COP passes by.

                                 COP
                    It ain't human ya know.

                    Thank you for choosing Senor Coffee.

        Black coffee is dispensed into a twentieth-century
        styrofoam cup.  Wade grabs it and drinks.

        A TECHNOTHUG comes screaming down the corridor, chased by
        TWO OFFICERS.  They draw their weapons.

                                 OFFICER #1
                    Freeze!

        Technothug grabs a potted plant off an Officer's desk and
        hurtles it at the Cops.

                                 OFFICER #2
                    Heads.

        The PLANT CRASHES to the floor.  Technothug averts and
        runs.  Growls and screams.  Yes, he does have a flaming
        skull tattoo.  Technothug stops in front of Wade, shrieking
        like a banshee.  Wade cringes.  Technothug's eyes grow
        wide, and he quickly shuts up.  Wade's knee in his balls
        doesn't feel good either.  Technothug slumps to the floor
        in excruciating pain, holding his groin.  All that and
        Wade didn't spill his coffee.

        <u>INT.  SEWER SYSTEM</u>

        Some things remain the same.  Murky water.  Rats.  Inde-
        scribable smells.  Dark and spooky.  Doucet sits slouched
        against the wall tying torn shirt cloth around his wrist.
        A crude homemade tourniquet.  A bandage already covers his
        shoulder wound.  His hands tremble and hairline recedes.
        The muscles in the solar plexus and stomach slowly droop.
        He's aging, entering his early forties.

        <u>INT.  SANCHEZ'S HOSPITAL ROOM</u>

        Sanchez lies in bed.  Face and hands bandaged.  Wade walks
        in.  Carrying a gym bag.  Sanchez smiles.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    Rip Van Winkle.

                                 WADE
                    How ya feeling?

                                 SANCHEZ
                    How do I look?

                                 WADE
                    Not too good.

        They laugh.  Wade opens the gym bag.  Removes the holograph
        framed photo of Sanchez's fiancee and lays it on the night
        stand.

                                 WADE
                    I brought you some toys.

        He next pulls out a lap-top computer and a dispatch headset.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    What's this?

                                 WADE
                    We're partners, aren't we?

        <u>EXT.  STREET LEVEL</u>

        A manhole cover rises and Doucet climbs out into an inter-
        section.  A car swerves to avoid him.  He steps into a
        Compuphone.

        <u>INT.  COMPUPHONE</u>

        Operator comes on line.  She pauses before speaking.
        Doucet has that affect on people.  Especially now.  He
        looks like walking death.

                                 OPERATOR (V.O.  )
                    Would you like 911 - Emergency?

                                 DOUCET
                    <u>I want Wade</u>.

        Operator gets to work.

                                 OPERATOR (V.O.)
                    I have a Valley number.

                                 DOUCET
                    Yes.

        She looks at him weird.

                                 OPERATOR (V.O.)
                    Ringing...

        Screen goes black... and then Casey comes on.  Willy in the
        b.g.

                                 CASEY
                    Hello.

        Doucet's voice is raspy.  Almost caveman-like.

                                 DOUCET
                    Where is he?

        Cassy doesn't recognize Doucet.  He's older and messed up.
        His own mother wouldn't recognize him.

                                 CASSY
                    I think you have the wrong number.

        Doucet screams...

                                 DOUCET
                    <u>WHERE IS HE</u>?

        Cassy turns to Willy.  Doucet is getting crazy.

                                 CASSY
                    Go to your room.

                                 WILLY
                    But...

                                 CASSY
                    Now.

        Doucet chuckles like a sick puppy.

                                 DOUCET
                    He's going to die.

                                 CASSY
                    Don't you have anything better to
                    do with your time?

        She thinks this is a crank call.  Doucet laughs.

                                 CASSY
                    I'm going to report this to the
                    phone company.

        Cassy hangs up.  The look on Doucet's face is great.  He
        is supposed to work for the phone company.  He smashes his
        fist through the Compuphone screen.

        <u>EXT.  SUBURBAN SPLIT LEVEL (VALLEY)</u>

        Wade's new cruiser pulls to the curb two houses across from
        his family's.

        ANOTHER UNMARKED CRUISER sits at end of the block.

        <u>INT.  OTHER UNMARKED CRUISER (UNIT 45)</u>

        Two Detectives.  The passenger, CEFALO sleeps.  The driver,

        Cefalo rises from his slumped position and spots Wade
        sitting in his cruiser.  He quickly keys the onboard
        computer.  LAPD vehicle registration on the monitor.

                                 MORROW
                    It's Wade all right.

        Morrow goes for the door.  Cefalo holds him back.

                                 CEFALO
                    Cut him a break.  He stopped a 211

        Wade stares at his family's house.  Displayed on the
        monitor is a Dwell File.  Three residents live at the
        address shown.  Cassy Wade, Kimberly Wade Simpson, and
        William Simpson.  Wade looks sad and tired.  He is
        afraid to move.  He pulls out his family snapshot.  His
        hands tremble as he unfolds it.  He lays it on the dash.
        Squelches the headset.

        It takes a second to hit Wade, and when it does, it almost
        floors him.  He's staring at his family.  His wife Cassy,
        still beautiful, is now in her mid-forties.  His four-
        year-old daughter is now a woman of twenty-four.  A lump
        the size of an apple forms in his throat.

                                 KIMBERLY
                    Maybe I should put on the training
                    whe---

                                 WILLY
                    Not the 'T' word.

                                 KIMBERLY
                    Ooops, I forgot.

                                 CASSY
                    Cars have four wheels.

                                 WILLY
                    Does this look like a car?  This is
                    a bike.  Two wheels.  One seat.

        Willy pedals away unsteadily.

                                 WILLY
                    I got it.  See ya.

                                 CASSY
                    Be careful.

                                 KIMBERLY
                    Bye.

        Cassy and Kimberly re-enter the house.

        <u>INT.  WADE'S UNMARKED CRUISER</u>

        Shaken, wade steadies himself along the dash, holding back
        the tears.  In the rearview mirror, he can see Willy
        approach.  Wade panics and STARTS the ENGINE.  He's not
        ready for this.

        <u>EXT.  STREET</u>

        Willy struggles with the pedals and handlebars.  He falls.
        Wade jumps out of the cruiser and rushes to his aid.

        <u>INT.  OTHER UNMARKED CRUISER - UNIT 45</u>

        Cefalo and Morrow watch.

        <u>EXT.  STREET</u>

        Wade helps Willy to his feet.

                                 WADE
                    You all right?

                                 WILLY
                    Yeah.

                                 WADE
                           (looking over bike)
                    Seat's too high.

                                 WILLY
                    My mom says I'm gonna grow.

        Wade laughs.  Willy notices the .38 sitting in Wade's
        holster like a fashion accessory.

                                 WILLY
                    Hey mister, you a policeman?

        Wade looks confused.  Willy stares at his gun.  Wade
        buttons his jacket.

                                 WADE
                    Yes.

                                 WILLY
                    My granddad was a policeman.

        Wade wants to say something.  But he can't.

                                 WILLY
                    I'm going to be a policeman.

                                 WADE
                    What's your name?

                                 WILLY
                    William Simpson.  I like Willy.

                                 WADE
                    Good to know you, Willy.

        Willy mounts his bike.

                                 WADE
                    Let me help you.

        Wade helps Willy balance himself.  He runs along with the
        bike until Willy is riding by himself.

                                 WILLY
                    Bye.  Thanks.

                                 WADE
                    Remember, get the seat fixed.

        Willy drives off.  Wade stands watching him for a moment.
        He turns to the house.  He wants to step forward, but it's
        not an easy walk.  He hesitates, walks and then recoils.
        He glances back and for the first time notices the other
        unmarked cruiser.

        <u>INT.  OTHER UNMARKED CRUISER</u>

        Cefalo and Morrow watch Wade as he crosses back to his
        cruiser.

        Wade climbs in.  He stares at himself in the rearview
        mirror.

        <u>EXT.  STREET</u>

        Wade's cruiser door opens.  He gets out and walks across
        the street determined.  CEFALO AND MORROW step out of their
        cruiser and stand beside it, watching.  They exchange
        glances with Wade.  Cefalo and Morrow nod their approval.

        <u>EXT.  SUBURBAN SPLIT LEVEL</u>

        Wade stands at the end of the walkway leading to the front
        door.  He hesitates and crosses the lawn into the backyard.
        He stops at a window.  Curtains half-drawn.  He stares into
        the empty living room.

        HIS POV - KIMBERLY

        Suddenly Kimberly crosses the living room into the kitchen.
        Cassy is sitting at the table drinking coffee.

                                 KIMBERLY (V.O.)
                    Michael called yesterday.  He wants
                    to take Willy for the summer.

                                 CASSY (V.O.)
                    What did you say?

                                 KIMBERLY (V.O.)
                    I'd think about it.

        BACK TO SCENE

        Wade watches, punishing himself.  Nothing like looking in
        from the outside to depress someone.

        HIS POV

        Kimberly searches through the refrigerator.

                                 KIMBERLY (V.O.)
                    Mr. Murphy asked about you again at
                    work yesterday.

                                 CASSY (V.O.)
                           (chuckles)
                    He just wants me to make him cinnamon
                    cookies like I made for you.

                                 KIMBERLY (V.O.)
                    I think he wants more than your cookies.

                                 CASSY (V.O.)
                    Kimberly!

                                 KIMBERLY (V.O.)
                    Mom, I hate to break this to you,
                    but there's a whole other species
                    out there you're neglecting.  If
                    you've forgotten, they're called
                    'men'.  Sometimes referred to in
                    more colorful language.

        They both laugh.

        BACK TO SCENE

        Wade stands stone-cold.  A tear trickles down his cheek.

        <u>INT.  WADE'S UNMARKED CRUISER</u>

        Wade climbs in.  He looks like a frightened child.  He
        tries to fight back the tears, but it isn't easy.

        Cefalo and Morrow climb in.  Cefalo keys the Dispatch.

        A Mercedes, BMW and cruiser sit in the driveway.

        <u>INT.  LIBRARY - GALLAGHER'S HOME</u>

        Mahogany wood.  Hard covers.  Some first editions.  No
        paperbacks here.  Bennett and Davidson eyeball the
        literature.  The door opens and Gallagher steps in.
        Keyed-up.  Knotting his tie.  Watching his wristwatch
        television.  Frick and Frack follow tight.

                                 GALLAGHER

                                 BENNETT
                    Wade did a little reminiscing.

        Gallagher shuts the door.

                                 GALLAGHER
                    What is this, the fucking Key-Stone
                    Cops?!

                                 DAVIDSON
                    Cefalo and Morrow said he was more
                    like a spectator.

                                 GALLAGHER
                    He didn't go in.  That's good.

                                 BENNETT
                    Can't figure.  Guy hasn't seen his
                    family in twenty years.

        Doucet sits in the middle of the room.  Sweating, big time.
        Aged.  Pained.  The DOCTOR steps into the room wearing a
        dirty-white lab jacket, holding a miniature full-body X-ray.

                                 DOCTOR

        DOOR SLAMS.  Doctor spins.  Doucet is gone.

        <u>INT.  NORTH HOLLYWOOD BAR</u>

        A low-life watering hole.  Smokey air.  Sticky tables.
        Loners.  Whores on a coffee break.  Except it's early in
        the morning.  The BARTENDER watches election news on an
        overhead 19-inch.  A SLEAZEBAG nurses a half-empty beer.
        A WHORE stands by the jukebox.  Wade sits at the bar and
        drinks.

                                 WADE
                           (to the Bartender)
                    I'll have another.

        The Bartender nods and gets to work.  Pours a whiskey.
        Wade looks like a man with serious shit on his mind.
        The Whore approaches.  Open for business.

                                 WHORE

                                 WHORE
                    You could always take it off.

                                 WADE
                    It's stuck, but thanks for the offer.

        The Whore pulls out her medical report.  She doesn't give up
        easy.

        The Whore walks away.  Business is bad.  The Bartender
        sets a glass of whiskey in front of Wade.  Sleazebag slides
        over.

                                 SLEAZEBAG

                           (to himself)
                    Nobody talks normal anymore.

        The Sleazebag rolls up his shirt sleeve.  His arm is a
        mess.  A shriveled-up cluster of decaying flesh.  Green-
        brown.  Almost gangrene.  Wade cringes.

        Wade heads for his cruiser.  His portable SQUAWKS.  He
        picks it up and speaks.

                    Yeah.

                    This should make your day.  The guy

                    was arrested a total number of twenty-

                                 SANCHEZ (V.O.)
                    That's just it.  He never did time.
                    Seems each arrest was botched for one
                    reason or another.  Judge threw out
                    the cases each time.  Either he's got
                    a horseshoe up his ass or powerful
                    friends.

        Sanchez groans.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    Looky here, seems Dubbs is still in
                    business.

                                 WADE (V.O.)
                    What are you doing this for, Sanchez?

                                 SANCHEZ
                    If you were set up, I want to find
                    out who did it.

        <u>INT.  CONVENTION ROOM - LUXURY HOTEL</u>

        Gallagher stands center stage.  Arms in the air.  Waving.
        Blowing kisses with Nixon-like charisma.  A full house
        cheers him on.  After a brief moment his entourage hurries
        him offstage.

        <u>EXT.  BACKSTAGE</u>

        Gallagher loosens his tie.  Roshko forces his way through
        the entourage and whispers in Gallagher's ear.  Gallagher
        steams.  Bites his lip.  Obviously he's not pleased with
        what Roshko's just told him.  He heads for the glass
        elevators.  The doors open.  Gallagher steps in.  Stops
        his entourage.

                                 GALLAGHER
                    Take next one.  I'll be okay.
                    Meet you on the roof.

        <u>INT.  GLASS ELEVATOR</u>

        Speeds up.  Stops halfway to the top.  Doors open.  Dubbs
        stands alone.  Nervous.  Twenty years older than the Wade
        trial video.  He steps in.  Gallagher is not happy.

                                 GALLAGHER
                    What was so urgent it couldn't wait?

        The elevator doors close.  Gallagher hits the STOP button.

                                 DUBBS
                    Someone's snooping around.  My cop
                    files were accessed.

                                 GALLAGHER
                           (grins)
                    Dubbsy, you've been doing too much
                    of your own shit.  You're paranoid.
                    It's probably just a routine LAPD
                    computer update.

                                 DUBBS
                    Well I don't like it.  It's never
                    happened before.  Lose my files.

                                 GALLAGHER
                    I just can't do that, Dubbsy.

                                 DUBBS
                    You're gonna be Mayor.  You could do
                    anything.  Look... I've come through
                    for you whenever you needed a favor.
                    Do this one for me.

        Gallagher smiles.  Pats Dubbs on the cheek.

                                 GALLAGHER
                    Okay.

        Gallagher switches off the stop button.  The elevator doors
        open.

                                 GALLAGHER
                    You registered?

        Dubbs steps out.  Pulls out his voter's registration card.

                                 DUBBS
                    You're the man.

        The doors close.  Elevator continues upwards.

                                 GALLAGHER
                           (beams)
                    And don't forget it.

        <u>EXT.  HELIPAD - ROOF - LUXURY HOTEL</u>

        A Rotojet idles.  Gallagher is met by his entourage and
        escorted over to his copter.

        <u>EXT.  STUDIO CITY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - SCHOOL YARD</u>

        Recess.  Willy and a group of friends play ball.

        AUDITORIUM

        adjacent to the school.  Workers are hanging a banner which
        reads:  VOTE HERE.

        A MAN in the distance.  Standing stone-like across from the
        school.  A CLOSER SHOT reveals it is no ordinary man.  It is
        Doucet.  This is how children end up on milk cartons.  The
        SCHOOL BELL sounds.

        <u>INT.  CLASSROOM</u>

        Willy sits surrounded by his PALS as the TEACHER calls out
        the attendance.  This class is not over attentive.

                                 TEACHER
                    Charlie Gibbs... Charlie Gibbs...

                                 GIBBS
                           (calling out)
                    Not here.

        Everyone laughs.  A KNOCK on the door interrupts the
        action.  Vice-principal ROGER ADAMS steps in.  Nothing
        like authority to break up the fun.

                                 MR. ADAMS
                    Good morning.
                           (gesturing with his
                            index finger)
                    Willy Simpson, come with me please.

        Willy's eyes go wide.  Mind racing, coming up with excuses
        for things he never did.

                                 PAL #1
                           (leans and whispers)
                    You're trashed, Willy.

        Willy crosses the room.  Mr. Adams ushers him out.

        <u>EXT.  HALLWAY</u>

        Mr. Adams closes the door.

                                 MR. ADAMS
                    Don't worry, you're not in trouble.
                    Your father called and asked me...

                                 WILLY
                           (startled)
                    My dad?

                                 MR. ADAMS
                    He's coming to pick you up.  You
                    have a---

                                 WILLY
                    My dad lives in New York.

        Mr. Adams takes a step back, perplexed.

                                 MR. ADAMS
                    That's funny...

        Willy stares at something in the distance.  His mouth
        drops.  A scared look blankets his face.  Mr. Adams turns.

        THEIR POV

        Like an unwanted relative, Doucet appears with no warning.
        He draws his gun.  Silencer on.

        BACK TO SCENE

        SCHOOL BELL RINGS.  Flocks of children storm the halls.  A
        sea of three and four foot scholars.  Doucet hesitates from
        firing.  Mr. Adams grabs Willy's hand and makes a run for
        it.  Doucet moves after them.  Children play.  Doucet cuts
        through, stepping over pint-sized partiers if he has to.
        Mr. Adams and Willy round a corner.

                                 WILLY
                    Who is that?

                                 MR. ADAMS
                    Isn't that your father?

        Willy shakes his head 'no'.  Mr. Adams tugs at his arm,
        pulling him down the hall.  Doucet on their trail.  A
        SECOND BELL RINGS.  Children dart into their classes.  The
        hall slowly empties.  A TEACHER steps out into the hall.

                                 TEACHER
                    Hey, you can't bring a gun into---

        Doucet FIRES, the force of which slams the Teacher against
        a trophy cabinet.  Mr. Adams and Willy continue.  Willy
        trips and releases his grip.  Mr. Adams stops turns.

                                 MR. ADAMS
                    C'mon Willy... c'mon!

        Doucet charges, grabbing Mr. Adams and lifting him into
        air with one hand.  Mr. Adams weeps.  Doucet reaches into
        his pocket and pulls out a note scribbled in blood.
        Addressed to Wade.  He shoves the note into Mr. Adams'
        mouth.

                                 DOUCET
                    You will be my messenger.

        Mr. Adams moans.  Doucet's free hand disappears.  The
        MUFFLED SOUND of AUTOMATIC FIRE breaks the silence.  Mr.
        Adams' body spasms.  Bye bye Vice Principal.  Doucet drops
        the body to the floor.

        <u>INT.  SQUAD ROOM</u>

        Portable 8-inch sets on every desk.  News Announcers dis-
        cuss today's election.  Cops keep one eye on their work
        and one on the news.  Davidson passes through.

                                 DAVIDSON
                    Anybody know where Wade is?

        <u>INT.  MEN'S ROOM</u>

        Wade stands in front of the mirror.  He hesitantly raises
        his hand and touches his face.  Takes a deep breath.
        Getting older in such short time is a lot for one man to
        handle.  He runs his hand through his hair.  Singles out a
        patch of grey.  Pauses.  Spots a tube of black shoe polish
        at the end of the sink.  Grabs it.  Opens it and squeezes
        some into his palm.  A COP enters and makes a beeline over
        to a urinal.  He glances at wade awkwardly.  Wade runs the
        shoe polish over his patch of grey.  The Cop steps away
        from the urinal and heads for the door.

                                 WADE
                    Afternoon.

        Cop leaves.  Wade slides down the wall to his ass.  Wraps
        his hands around his knees and lowers his head.  Ponders.
        After a brief moment, he rises and stands in front of the
        mirror.  Most of the grey is gone, but not all.  There is
        no hiding his age.  He takes a good look at himself.  Steps
        into a stall.

        <u>INT.  STALL</u>

        Wade sits.  He pulls out his family photos and stares at it.
        Frowns.

        <u>INT.  MEN'S ROOM</u>

        Davidson bursts in.

                                 DAVIDSON
                    Wade, you in here?!

        <u>INT.  STALL</u>

        Wade quickly pockets the picture.

                                 WADE
                    Yeah!

        <u>INT.  MEN'S ROOM</u>

        Wade steps out of the stall.

                                 DAVIDSON
                    Everyone's looking for you.
                    Doucet's got your grandson.

        <u>INT.  SQUAD ROOM</u>

        Wade enters.  Davidson behind.  Gallagher is there.  So
        are Bennett and Frick and Frack.

                                 GALLAGHER
                    Just got the call.  Took him from
                    school.  Bastard nailed the Vice-
                    Principal and a teacher.

                                 WADE
                    Where?

        Gallagher hands Wade Doucet's note.  Wade opens it.  It's
        written in blood.  Slightly blurred.  Almost like a child
        using a crayon.  Gallagher reiterates what's written.

                                 GALLAGHER
                    TransAmerica building.  Downtown.
                    Fifteen minutes or the kid dies.

        Wade crumples the note.

                                 GALLAGHER
                    That was two minutes ago.

        Wade looks at his watch.  He sets the stopwatch mode at
        thirteen minutes.  Gallagher opens a small case holding a
        syringe and a vial.  NPA serum.

                                 GALLAGHER
                    Roll up your sleeve.

        Wade heads for the door.

                                 WADE
                    I'm wasting time.

                                 GALLAGHER
                    You can't win like this.  You'll only
                    get older.  This is what you wanted!

                                 WADE
                           (over his shoulder)
                    Not anymore.

        Wade leaves.

                                 GALLAGHER
                           (to Bennett & Davidson)
                    I want a blanket on this.  Behind,
                    but not too far.

        <u>EXT.  POLICE STATION</u>

        Wade downs the stairs.  Adrenaline high.  A man repossessed.
        Two Cops usher Cassy and Kimberly up the stairs on the oppo-
        site end.  Women under extreme emotional tension.  Tears
        flow.  Wade stops dead seeing them.  Cassy and Kimberly see
        him.  Time stops.

        Twenty years of sorrow expressed in a single glance.
        Wade takes a few deep breaths.  Hearts pound.

                                 CASSY
                           (with love that
                            was never lost)
                    William!

        She calls from the heart.  There is sadness, tears and joy
        in her voice.  Wade doesn't move, and when he does, it's
        down the stairs.  He can't face them until he redeems
        himself.

                                 KIMBERLY
                    Dad!

        Cassy and Kimberly watch as wade dives into his cruiser and
        peels out.

        <u>INT.  WADE'S UNMARKED CRUISER</u>

        Wade drives like a madman.  Make that lunatic.  His eyes
        sadder than ever.  He could be crying, but he hides it well.

        <u>EXT.  WADE'S UNMARKED CRUISER</u>

        This cruiser never had it so rough.  Swaying in and out of
        traffic.  Lights flashing.  TIRES SQUEALING.  Complete dis-
        respect for the law.

        <u>INT.  WADE'S UNMARKED CRUISER</u>

        Wade glances from the road to his watch.  His DISPATCH
        SQUAWKS.

                                 SANCHEZ (V.O.)
                    I just heard.

                                 WADE
                    He's got my grandson, Sanchez.

                                 SANCHEZ (V.O.)
                    You be careful.

                                 WADE
                    I'm signing off.

        Wade reaches to turn off the headset.

                                 SANCHEZ (V.O.)
                    No.  I want to be with you.

                                 WADE
                    No you don't.

        Wade shuts off the headset.  Pounds the pedal.

        <u>EXT.  TRANSAMERICA BUILDING - DOWNTOWN</u>

        Rising majestically above L.A.'s downtown district.  Window
        washers scale the 32 stories.

        WADE'S UNMARKED CRUISER pulls in and double parks.  Wade
        bolts out.  He heads for the main entrance.  His watch reads
        little over one minute.

        <u>EXT.  ROOF (TRANSAMERICA BUILDING)</u>

        The WIND WHISTLES hard and cold.  The body of a dead Main-
        tenance Worker lies face down beside the stairwell doors.
        Blood surrounds his chest area.  Strapped, spread-eagled to
        a small satellite dish, is Willy.  A look of stark terror
        on his face.  Doucet paces back and forth carrying the
        AR 2000.

                                 DOUCET
                    One minute!

        Willy trembles with fear.  Doucet coughs.  The NPA Syndrome
        is creeping in.  He wipes his mouth.  Turns to Willy and
        smiles.

                                 DOUCET
                    Superman can't save you now, little
                    boy.

        On the word "boy", the stairwell door bursts open and Wade
        explodes in, full force.  Out of breath.  Tired.  Looking
        like shit.  Doucet pivots and the two square off.  Weapons
        aimed.

                                 WADE
                    Let him go.  You've got me!

        Doucet laughs.

                                 WADE
                           (places his gun
                            on the floor)
                    I'm putting it down.

        Doucet laughs harder.  Wade puts his hands in the air.

                                 WADE
                    Let the boy go.

        Wade's right hand goes numb.  He massages the joint.  Small
        pendulous formations appear on his neck.  He trembles and
        runs his hand through his hair.  A fistful comes out.  A
        small bald spot left on the back of his head.  Light scaly
        spots form on the back of his hands.  There is a slight
        droop of the upper eyelids and inward turning of the lower
        ones.  Loss of fat causes wrinkles and folds in his
        once-taut muscular frame.  He enters his late thirties.
        Doucet continues laughing.

                                 WADE
                           (painfully)
                    You want me.  He's nothing to you!

                                 DOUCET
                    He's your blood.

        A tremor of pain runs through Wade's leg.  He grabs his
        thigh and cringes in pain.  Doucet lays down the AR 2000
        and marches forward.

                                 DOUCET
                    You hurt me.  Now I'm going to hurt
                    you.  It's time to die.

        Wade is virtually helpless.  Doucet slaps him hard across
        the face, sending the Cop to the ground.  Wade coughs.

        His breath is unsteady.  Doucet kicks him full in the
        chest.  Wade spits out blood, having suffered damage of
        a structural nature to his ribs.  Attempts to withstall
        Doucet's assault are interrupted by the sudden re-arrange-
        ment of Wade's left wrist.  This Cop is getting his ass
        wiped.  Doucet moves even quicker.  All elbows, all knees,
        like an animal.  Willy screams from the sidelines.  Doucet
        lifts Wade into the air and hurtles him across the room.
        Wade rolls off the roof.  His hands grasp the ledge.  Down
        is bad.  Down is far.  Down is death.  With the reserves of
        his strength, Wade struggles to pull himself up.  Doucet
        charges.

        NFA syndrome hits Doucet like a runaway train.  Pain shoots
        right through him.  He screams as he ages five years right
        before Wade's eyes.  Into his fifties.  Wade takes advan-
        tage.  He comes up and rolls barrel-like, rising to his
        feet.  He double-hands Doucet in the gut, staggering him.
        Wade compliments that with the same to the back of the
        monster's head.

        Both men are aging.  Big time.  Doucet to sixty.  Wade to
        mid-forties.  It makes the fight that much more painful and
        tiring.  Doucet rabbit punches.  Wade blocks and coils.
        Stiff arms and coils.  Doucet's knees hit the ground.
        Wade grabs his head and forces it into his knee bone.

        Wade manifests combat acumen of startling proportions.
        Doucet goes down for the count.  Wade turns to Willy.
        Doucet grabs his leg and brings the Cop down hard.  Doucet
        rises and kicks wade in the gut.  These are field goal
        kicks.  High and hard.  He bounces across the roof like a
        bean bag.  Doucet stops and picks up the AR 2000.  Wade
        tries to move, but he can't.  He and Willy's eyes meet.
        Defenseless and beaten, Wade lies in crippled agony.

                                 DOUCET
                    Playtime's over.

        Wade turns and faces the dangerous end of Doucet's gun.
        WHUP-WHUP-WHUP-WHUP-WHUP.  A ROTOJET rises beside the
        building.

                                 PILOT (V.O.)
                    Drop your weapon.  You are locked
                    on target and under arrest.

        Bennett and Davidson burst through the stairwell door.
        Guns aimed.

                                 BENNETT
                    Freeze!

        Doucet swings the AR 2000 around and side-steps over to
        Willy.  Bennett FIRES.  A bullet rips into Doucet's thigh.
        He winces but doesn't stop.  Doucet sticks his Buck M9
        under the boy's chin.

                                 DOUCET
                    The boy dies.

        Wade rises sluggishly.

                                 WADE
                    Don't shoot.

                                 PILOT (V.O.)
                    Simon Doucet, you are locked on
                    target.  Release the child.

                                 DOUCET
                    Say good-bye, Wade!

        Wade hobbles over to the ledge.

                                 WADE
                           (calling out to the Pilot)
                    Don't shoot!

                                 BENNETT
                           (into portable)
                    Hold back!  The kid's too close!

        Doucet cuts the restrainers that bind Willy to the
        satellite dish.  He takes the kid's hand.  A loud
        MECHANICAL SOUND interrupts the action.

        A WINDOW WASHER rises beside the building.  Standing
        on an electric scaffold.

                                 WADE
                    Get back to work!

        Doucet pulls Willy back to the scaffold and grabs the
        AR 2000.  The Window Washer pushes the lever down.
        Doucet stops him.

                                 DOUCET
                    Leave!

        The Window Washer steps off.  Doucet steps on.  Willy in
        tow.

                                 WADE
                    Don't take the kid!

        Doucet mans the lever.  The scaffold lowers.  Wade, Bennett
        and Davidson race over to the ledge.  The scaffold scales
        the building.  Doucet laughs.

                                 BENNETT
                           (into portable)
                    Follow him.

        The Rotojet slowly descends.  Wade leads the pack to the
        door.

        <u>INT.  CORRIDOR</u>

        Wade charges forward and punches the elevator "down"
        button, impatiently.  Bennett and partner on his heels.
        Wade heads for the stairwell.

                                 BENNETT
                    Hey, that's 32 flights of stairs!
                    You're crazy.

        Wade pays no attention to Bennett.

        <u>INT.  STAIRWELL</u>

        The door flings open and Wade enters.  He looks down.  An
        abyss with stairs.  Wade should have listened to Bennett.
        He grabs hold of the railing and starts down.

        <u>EXT.  TRANSAMERICA BUILDING</u>

        The Rotojet follows Doucet and Willy on the scaffold.
        Twenty-odd stories to go.

        <u>INT.  LAW OFFICE SUITES</u>

        Wade darts through the maze of offices and partitions.  A
        SECRETARY follows him.

                                 SECRETARY
                    Mister... you can't... excuse me...

        Wade bursts through the office of a senior partner.

        <u>INT.  SENIOR PARTNER'S OFFICE</u>

        A silver-haired EXECUTIVE sits beside his antique desk.
        Talking on the telephone.  Wade takes him by surprise.

                                 SENIOR PARTNER (EXECUTIVE)
                           (hand over the receiver)
                    Wait a... hold on a second...

        Wade draws the curtains.

                                 SENIOR PARTNER
                    What do you think...

        Outside, the scaffold is lowering.  Doucet and Willy
        appear.  A chilling grin on the psychopath's face.  He
        presses the knife against Willy's throat.  The ROTOJET
        follows in the b.g.

                                 WADE
                    Bastard.

        Wade races out of the office.

        <u>INT.  STAIRWELL</u>

        Wade shoots down a flight of stairs.  Dizzy, exhausted, his
        body strained to the limit.  He slumps against the wall to
        steady himself.  Spots a fire hose coiled up against the
        wall.  Without hesitation he rips open the fire box, and
        hauls out the hose.  Drops it down the stairwell.  Looks
        down at his ingenuity.

                                 WADE
                           (to himself)
                    It's not over yet.

        He grabs hold of the hose, steps off the railing and slides
        down the rest of the stories.  Broken.  Beaten.  He should
        be dead.

        <u>EXT.  TRANSAMERICA BUILDING</u>

        The scaffold comes to a stop on street level.  Doucet grabs
        Willy and runs.  The Rotojet follows.  The sparse crowds
        watch the action.

                                 ROTOJET (V.O.)
                    Please, stay indoors.  Everyone, go
                    inside!

        Sennett and Davidson storm out of the building.  Guns
        drawn.

        A cadillac parks along the curb in front of a fire hydrant.

        A BUSINESSMAN opens the door and is met by Doucet who
        yanks him out.

                                 BUSINESSMAN
                    Hey... what the...

        The Businessman wises up and races away after seeing
        Doucet's high-powered friend.

                                 FIRE HYDRANT (V.O.)
                           (from voice modulator)
                    You are in direct violation of
                    Municipal Ordinance...

        Doucet shoves Willy into the car, spins and triggers the
        AR 2000.  STRAFES the fire hydrant.

                                 FIRE HYDRANT (V.O.)
                    Thank you for obeying...

        The hydrant EXPLODES.  Bennett and Davidson FIRE.  Doucet
        FIRES.  A BUS APPROACHES.  The big kind.  Two sections.
        Sixteen wheels.  Wade exits the building.

                                 WADE
                           (shouting to Cops)
                    Stop shooting!

        Davidson stops a wild bullet the hard way.  He falls back-
        wards clutching his chest wound.  Doucet drives away.

                                 BENNETT
                           (leaning over his partner)
                    How is it?

                                 DAVIDSON
                    Stings.

                                 WADE
                    Stay with him.

        Wade races off.   Bennett calls for an ambulance over his
        portable.  The bus stops.  Unloads passengers.  Wade steps
        in.

        <u>INT.  BUS</u>

        Wade flashes his badge to the Driver.

                                 WADE
                    I need this bus.  Now!

        The Driver hesitates.  Wade climbs up the bus stairs.

                                 WADE
                    It's okay.  I'm in the Union.  RTD
                    employee number 55643 dash A.

        The Driver gets up.

                                 BUS DRIVER
                    She's all yours, pal.

        The Driver exits.  Remaining passengers disembark early.  A
        STREET BUM sleeps in back.  Wade mans the wheel and closes
        the door.  He knows the mechanics well.  Like a seasoned
        pro he puts the dinosaur in gear.  If you've forgotten,
        his Rehab Training was to be a bus driver.

        <u>EXT.  STREET</u>

        The bus pulls away from the curb in pursuit of Doucet.
        The Rotojet follows overhead.

        <u>INT.  ROTOJET</u>

        Battle Mode.  The PILOT lows the two vehicles closely.

                                 PILOT
                           (to Dispatch)
                    ...traveling West on 8th Street.
                    Request road block corner 8th and
                    Western...

                                 DISPATCH (V.O.)
                    Roger.

        <u>EXT.  STREET</u>

        The bus closes the gap between the Cadillac and itself.
        Wade handles the wheel like a veteran RTD employee.

        <u>INT.  BUS</u>

        Wade turns hard.  The Street Bum falls to the floor.
        Rises groggily.

                                 STREET BUM
                    Is this my stop?

        He heads for the front of the bus.  Sees the chase.

                                 STREET BUM
                    Go get 'em boy.

        Wade looks back.  Does a double take.

                                 WADE
                    Get down.

        Wade spins the wheel.  The street Bum is thrown into a
        seat.

        <u>INT.  DOUCET'S CADILLAC</u>

        Doucet pounds the pedal.  Blood cakes around his thigh
        wound.  He coughs.  Willy sits curled up against the
        passenger door.

        <u>INT.  BUS</u>

        Street Bum behind Wade.

                                 STREET BUM
                    Make a left there.  You'll cut
                    him off.

        Wade looks back.  Cringes.  Returns to the chase.  Up ahead
        there's help.

        <u>EXT.  STREET</u>

        A road block.  Ten cop cruisers.  Cops stand at attention,
        holding high-powered rifles.  Doucet's Cadillac tears up
        the road.  The bus behind.  Rotojet overhead.  No where to
        go but jail.

        <u>INT.  DOUCET'S CADILLAC</u>

        Doucet's lifeless eyes stares down the Cops.  His hands
        tighten their grip on the steering wheel.

        <u>EXT.  STREET</u>

        Doucet's Cadillac strikes the roadblock at 100 mph+.
        Cruisers forced apart.  Glass, paint and metal everywhere.
        The Cadillac spins out in a cloud of smoke.  The crumpled
        hood flies off.  Doucet fights the skid, slowing to a stop.
        He climbs out.  Willy jumps out and runs to safety.

        <u>INT.  BUS</u>

                                 WADE
                           (to Street Bum)
                    Hang on.

        Street Bum grabs a seat.  Watches wide-eyed.  Yells  in
        excitement as...

        <u>EXT.  STREET</u>

        The bus plows through the roadblock, bearing down on
        Doucet.  Doucet pivots, swings the AR 2000 over his
        shoulder and hops onto the bumper of the speeding bus.
        Wade spins the wheel, trying to force Doucet off.  Doucet
        brings the AR 2000 forward and proceeds to blow away the
        WINDSHIELD, dicing it to smithereens.  Waves the gun like a
        wand, strafing 'X' patterns, FIRING all the while he hangs
        on with his free hand.

        Wade ducks.  Street Bum hits the floor, cussing a blue
        streak.  Doucet EMPTIES a FIFTY ROUND CLIP.  BULLETS CHIP
        away at the front of the bus, leaving pockmarks.  Empty,
        Doucet tosses the useless weapon aside.  Wade rises.

        <u>EXT./INT.  BUS</u>

        Wade FIRES his .38.  BULLETS RICOCHET off METAL as Doucet
        darts the fire.  Two find their way into his shoulder.
        One full in the chest.  He swears, loses his grip momen-
        tarily, but somehow hangs on.  The Rotojet bears down on
        the bus.

                                 PILOT (V.O.)
                    Sergeant Wade, pull over.  Stop your
                    vehicle and arrest your suspect.

        BACK TO SCENE

        Doucet reaches into his overcoat and pulls out the compact
        Stinger missile launcher.  Aims it at the Rotojet.  Looks
        to Wade, smiles and FIRES.  Rotojet is hit.  It spins into
        an air whirlpool.  Smoking.  SCREAMING.  Pieces rain.
        EXPLODING INTO A FIREBALL.

        BACK TO SCENE

        Doucet struggles to climb into the bus.  Wade kicks him
        back out.  Shifts gears.  With one arm, Doucet balances
        himself.  Blood stains his clothing.  This is not fun.
        Not even for Doucet.

                                 DOUCET
                           (with a maniacal
                            gleam in his eye)
                    Arrest me.  You've won.

        Wade drives faster.  He removes his belt with one hand.

                                 DOUCET
                    Arrest me.

        Wade loops the belt around the steering wheel and attaches
        the other end around the hydraulic door lever.  He turns
        the steering wheel and releases his grip.  The belt
        strains, holding the wheel steady.  He lodges a piece
        of broken metal between the seat and gas pedal.

                                 DOUCET
                    Bring me in.  Be a hero.

                                 WADE
                    I'm not in the cops and robbers
                    business anymore!

        Wade sounds the HORN.  Climbs out of the driver's seat.
        He heads towards the back of the bus.  Doucet turns.  The
        bus races towards the side of a warehouse.  A concrete
        wall.  For once, the look on Doucet's face is one of sheer
        fright.

        The bus, moving at about 75 mph+, EXPLODES into the wall,
        completely destroying the first section.  Doucet makes his
        first good impression.  It'll take weeks to find his body
        in the wreckage.  The second section is left undamaged.
        The back door opens and Wade steps out.  He walks away,
        never looking back.  He's in rough shape.  Cop cruisers
        appear.

        A ROOKIE steps out of the first cruiser to stop.

                                 ROOKIE COP
                           (calling out to Wade)
                    Hey, old timer.  Wait a minute.
                    There was a cop driving this thing.
                    Where is he?  Who are you?

                                 WADE
                           (over his shoulder)
                    Wade.  Sergeant Wade.

        Street Bum steps off the bus.  Smiles like a kid coming off
        a ride at Magic Mountain.  Rookie Cop rushes to his aid.

                                 STREET BUM
                    This was the best two-fifty I ever
                    spent.

        <u>INT.  SANCHEZ'S HOSPITAL ROOM</u>

        A Nurse walks in.  Carrying a tray of pills.  Sanchez is
        gone.

        <u>EXT.  HI-RISE APARTMENT - WOODMAN AVENUE</u>

        An ambulance stops.  Sanchez hops out.  Bandages off.  Face
        scared.

        <u>INT.  APARTMENT</u>

        Dubbs sits with a cute BROAD.  Melting a bizarre drug.
        Having a ball.  A KNOCK on the door interrupts the
        festivities.  Dubbs rises.  Opens an armoire.  Inside is
        a Bad Ass's collection of weapons.  Old and new hardware.
        Dubbs grabs an old pistol.  A .38 to be exact.  Crosses
        over to the door.

                                 DUBBS
                    Who is it?

                                 SANCHEZ (V.O.)
                    Avon Lady!

        On that, the door comes CRASHING down.  Right on top of
        Dubbs.  Broad screams and runs.  Sanchez stands on the door
        putting pressure on the Bad Ass's chest.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    My man Dubbs.

                                 DUBBS
                    Who are you?  What the fuck do you
                    want?

        Sanchez lifts Dubbs to his feet.  Dubbs cringes at
        Sanchez's torn-up face.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    I want to ask you a few questions.

                                 DUBBS
                    No, you're not model material.
                           (smiles)
                    Anything else?

        Sanchez slugs him.  Takes Dubbs' .38 and pockets it.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    Funny guy.

                                 DUBBS
                    Fuck you - fuck you.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    You helped set up my partner, Sergeant
                    William Wade.  I want to know who put
                    you up to it.

                                 DUBBS
                    Your mother.

        Sanchez grabs him.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    Tsch, I was hoping this'd be a lot
                    easier.

        You know, I get the feeling Wade's rubbed off on our
        Rookie.  Sanchez is acting like a cop.  Unpredictable.
        Tough.  I like it.  I like it.

        <u>EXT.  HI-RISE</u>

        Sanchez tapes Dubbs' hands and upper body to the back of
        the cruiser.  Mouth over the exhaust pipe.  Dubbs' eyes
        go in fright.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    Perfect fit.

        He pulls out a breath mint.  Puts it in Dubbs' pocket.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    For later.

        Sanchez crosses over to cruiser.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    You sure you don't want to talk.

        Dubbs' eyes stare and say no.  Sanchez sits down in the
        open cruiser.  Starts punching numbers into the ignition
        panel.  Dubbs sweats as each digit is registered.  Sanchez
        hums.  Dubbs growls.  He's ready to speak.  Sanchez smiles.
        Crosses over and rips the tape off.  Dubbs spits.  It
        gets quiet real fast.  Sanchez wipes his face.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    For that I'm going to rev the engine.

        He re-tapes Dubbs' mouth.  Heads for the driver's seat.
        Dubbs mumbles.  His eyes reveal he's ready to squeal.
        Sanchez removes the tape once again.  This time protecting
        himself from flying phlegm.

                                 DUBBS
                    Okay... I'll talk.

        Sanchez rips open his shirt.  Reveals a tape recording
        device taped to his body.  Dubbs takes a deep breath.
        That's because he's in deep shit.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    Speak up.

                                 DUBBS
                    It was Wade's old partner... Gallagher.
                    He was behind it all.

        Sanchez freezes.  Great look on his face.  He's got a
        million questions which are about to be answered.

                                 DUBBS
                    I worked for him... still do.  Said
                    he'd make sure I was left alone if I
                    helped put Wade away.  He kept his
                    promise for twenty years.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    Prepare for a change in lifestyle.

        Sanchez rams Dubbs' face into the bumper.  The bad ass
        snaps out cold.

        <u>INT.  POLICE STATION</u>

        Wade walks.  TWO BEAT COPS approach him.

                                 BEAT COP #1
                    I'm sorry, Wade...

        Beat Cop #2 snaps open a pair of cuffs.  Wade calculates
        the situation.  He should've expected this.  Gallagher's
        that type of guy.

                                 BEAT COP #1
                    ...Gallagher wants you brought back
                    to Cryo-Prison.

                                 WADE
                    I did my job.  I'm free.

        Beat Cop #2 moves to cuff Wade.

                                 BEAT COP #1
                    I'm sorry.  That's his orders.

        Wade rises.  Throws Beat Cop #2 into the back wall.  Beat
        Cop #1 goes for his gun.  Wade brings him down.  With a
        nifty hand-foot combo.  Wade spins.  Simultaneously every
        Cop in the precinct cocks their laser weapon.  Wade head-
        butts the first Cop to approach him.  He's not going to go
        down without a fight.  Three Cops tackle him.  He wrestles
        them off and continues.  Goes for the door.  Just as he's
        about to open it, he comes face to face with a nasty
        weapon.  The owner is a big Cop.

                                 BIG COP
                    Freeze or you're dust.

        Wade has nowhere to go but Cryo-Prison.

        <u>EXT.  POLICE STATION</u>

        Wade is ushered over to an idling cruiser.  Handcuffed.  It
        takes six cops to escort him.  Things look dim... until a
        SIREN WAILS.  Everyone spins.  An AMBULANCE SCREAMS into
        the cop parking lot.  Headed straight towards Wade.  The
        Cops dive for cover.  The ambulance SCREECHES to a stop.
        The passenger door is flung open.  Sanchez drives.  Wade
        is truly surprised.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    Hop in.

        Wade doesn't waste any time.  He dives in.  Sanchez PEELS
        OUT.  Cops rise.  One grabs his dispatch.

        <u>INT.  AMBULANCE</u>

        Sanchez drives with one hand.  Helps Wade out of his cuffs
        with the other hand.

                                 WADE
                    You should be in hospital.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    And you should be with your family.

        Sanchez glances from the road to Wade.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    You were right.  You were set up.  It
                    was your ex-partner... Gallagher.

        The news hits Wade like an A-bomb.  Sanchez tosses Wade
        Dubbs' .38.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    Old Faithful.

        <u>EXT.  WAREHOUSE WRECK</u>

        A huge tow truck slowly pulls the bus out of the wreckage.
        It RUMBLES and STRAINS.  Bennett is in command of the Cop
        Work Crew.  A slew of ambulances and fire trucks stand at
        the ready.  News vans appear.  The tow truck drags the bus
        away.  Bennett charges.  Followed by a team of cops.  Ready
        for anything.  They step over the rubble.  Glance around.
        Bennett looks puzzled.

                                 BENNETT
                    Where the hell is the body?

        A COP calls out.  Panic in his voice.

                                 COP
                    Over here.

        Bennett crosses over.  The cop stands looking down at
        Doucet's overcoat.  It's torn and tattered.  The body is
        gone.  Bennett's reaction is filled with horror.

                                 BENNETT
                    Oh shit.

        <u>INT.  BALLROOM</u>

        Tons of Gallagher supporters.  Gallagher campaign posters.
        Gallagher pennants.  Gallagher buttons.  MAYOR INGRIM
        stands on stage at a podium making a speech.  Behind him
        sits Gallagher, his wife and kids.  All smiles.  Frick and
        Frack in back.  Press cameras click.  Cheers all around...

                                 MAYOR INGRIM
                    ...I've known this man for many
                    years, and in some ways it's com-
                    forting to know that I am passing
                    the torch to such a dedicated...

        BACKSTAGE

        Wade and Sanchez walk.  Eyes fixed on the stage.  Two Cops
        try to stop them.  Wade back-elbows one into the wall.
        Sanchez the other.  Another Cop tries to tackle them from
        behind, but Wade sends him crashing into a stack of chairs.
        Wade and Sanchez approach Peebles.

                                 WADE
                    I want Gallagher!

        <u>INT.  PARKING GARAGE</u>

        A TELEPHONE REPAIRMAN walks up to a GUARD.  Helmet on.
        Head down.  Decked out in gear.

                                 GUARD
                    Can I help you?

                                 DOUCET (TELEPHONE REPAIRMAN)
                           (voice muffled)
                    I got a call about a problem with
                    your lines.

                                 GUARD
                    I don't know anything about a
                    problem.

        Telephone Repairman raises his head... and wouldn't you
        know it, it's Doucet.  He looks like he went through a
        meat grinder.  Guard gasps at the Telephone Repairman
        from hell.

                                 DOUCET
                    I'm your problem.

        He reaches out.  Headbutts the Guard and snaps his neck.

        <u>INT.  BALLROOM</u>

        Peebles walks hunched over to Gallagher.  He whispers in
        his ear.  Gallagher shakes his head.  Peebles insists.
        He gestures off-stage.

        THEIR POV

        Wade and Sanchez stand in the wings.

        BACK TO SCENE

        Gallagher can't believe it.  A "Holy Jesus" look sweeps
        his face.  He whispers to his wife and follows Peebles
        off-stage.  Frick and Frack trail.

                                 MAYOR INGRIM
                    ...his leadership has been an
                    inspiration.

        Gallagher leans over to Peebles and whispers.

                                 GALLAGHER
                    I'm going to need help.

        OFFSTAGE

        Peebles walks.  Gallagher approaches Wade and Sanchez.
        Frick and Frack stand tough.  The new mayor is uncom-
        fortable.  They stand in front of a campaign poster that
        reads:

                            HONESTY & INTEGRITY
                           THAT'S HIS MIDDLE NAME
                        VOTE RAY GALLAGHER FOR MAYOR

        Gallagher turns to Sanchez.  Takes a deep breath.
        Sanchez's face is too much.  Gallagher doesn't have a
        strong stomach.  He turns to Wade.

                                 GALLAGHER
                           (irritated)
                    What is it?  I'm about to go on.

                                 WADE
                    We have to talk.

                                 GALLAGHER
                    I heard about today.  Good job.  I'm
                    all for capital punishment.
                           (beat)
                    Why don't you go home and see your
                    family?

                                 WADE
                    That wasn't your plan, was it?

                                 GALLAGHER
                    What are you talking about?

        Gallagher nervously glances around.

                                 WADE
                    You were planning to send me back
                    to the ice house.
                           (beat)
                    You set me up.

                                 GALLAGHER
                    You're crazy.

                                 WADE
                    <u>You</u> were the dirty cop... and I was
                    on to you.  You panicked.  Afraid
                    I was going to expose you... so
                    you shut me up.

        Gallagher's slowly being taken down.

                                 GALLAGHER
                    I don't want to hear anymore.

                                 WADE
                    You stole the heroin out of the
                    evidence room and planted it on
                    me.  I was iced.  What better way
                    to keep me from talking.  Stop me
                    if I'm wrong.

        Peebles walks up with a couple Beat Cops in tow.  Rebecca
        and Roshko behind.

                                 GALLAGHER
                    You have no evidence.
                           (to Cops)
                    Arrest this man.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    You want evidence.  I'll give you
                    evidence.

        The Beat Cops move in.  Wade backs up.  Sanchez rips open
        his shirt.  Reveals the tape recorder.  Hits the "PLAY"
        button.

                                 DUBBS (V.O.)
                    It was Wade's old partner... Gallagher.
                    He was behind it all.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    Put that on your political resume.

        Gallagher panics.  Grabs one of the Beat COP's guns and
        pulls Rebecca close.  Shoves the barrel to her temple.
        Hasn't she taken enough abuse from Gallagher already?
        Wade draws his .38 and trains it on Gallagher.  Peebles
        interrupts.

                                 PEEBLES
                    Sir---

                                 GALLAGHER
                    Shut up!
                           (to Wade)
                    Drop it.

        Wade refuses.  Takes careful aim.  Gallagher cradles the
        trigger.  Rebecca sweats buckets.

                                 GALLAGHER
                    Drop it or she's dead.

        Wade grits his teeth.  Gallagher's dead serious.  Excuse
        the pun.  Wade throws the .38 to the floor.  Gallagher
        smiles.  Back steps.

        BACK TO SCENE

        Mayor Ingrim winds down his speech.

                                 MAYOR INGRIM
                    ...Ladies and gentlemen, I am proud
                    to give you the new Mayor of Los
                    Angeles... Ray Gallagher.

        The crowd ROARS its approval.  A standing ovation.
        Gallagher steps out of the wings with Rebecca.  Wade
        and Sanchez follow.  The crowd gasps.  Reporters do what
        they do best.  Gallagher's crazed.  He waves his gun
        around the room.  Cops appear.  Frick and Frack don't
        know what to do.

                                 GALLAGHER
                    Get back.  Get back or I'll do her
                    right now.

        Rebecca shits bricks.  Gallagher's going to explode any
        second now.  Sanchez offers Wade his laser handgun.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    Use this.  You can't miss.

        Wade looks over the futuristic weapon.  It's a far cry from
        his .38.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    G'head.  It's user friendly.

        Wade gives in to technology.  Takes the gun.  Switches it
        on.  It's an unbelievable weapon.

                                 WADE
                           (under his breath)
                    Welcome to the 21st century, Wade.

        Wade aims the laser targeting.  Gallagher uses Rebecca as
        his shield.

                                 GALLAGHER
                    Get back.

        Wade squints.  Two-hands the weapon.  Aims.

                                 WADE
                           (to Rebecca)
                    Spread your legs.

        Rebecca's frightened.  Probably pissed in her pants by now.
        Wade's asking her to spread her legs.  She looks at him
        weird.  A "whaaaa?" look on her face.

                                 WADE
                    Spread 'em!

        She does.  Wade FIRES.  Nails Gallagher in the leg.  He's
        thrown back.  Wade FIRES another into Gallagher's wrist.
        His weapon falls.  A Cop grabs it.  Gallagher slams into
        the wall and collapses.  Wade scoops up his .38.

                                 ROSHKO
                           (re: Gallagher)
                    <u>Someone call a MEDIVAC</u>.

        Wade walks.  Snaps off his cop badge.  Hands it and his
        .38 to Sanchez.

                                 WADE
                    You can have it.  I won't need it
                    in my new job.

        Wade heads backstage.  Frick and Frack help Gallagher to
        his feet, when all of a sudden Doucet lunges from behind
        the backstage curtain.  Full of rage.  Everyone moves in
        slow motion.  Gallagher stands in muted terror.  Frick and
        Frack spin.  Kai Ling readies his Aikido.  Screams and
        charges.  Doucet nonchalantly straightarms Kai Ling.
        Withdraws a telephone cord from his pouch.  Twists it
        around Kai Ling's neck and with one tug ends his life.
        Dokes springs into action.  Doucet grabs him and shoves
        an industrial pair of wire cutters into the man's chest.
        Gallagher slithers into a corner.  Doucet approaches.

                                 GALLAGHER
                    No... No... No... Please... <u>Wade</u>!
                    <u>Wade</u>!

        BACKSTAGE

        Wade walks.  Ignores the plea.  Sanchez grabs him.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    Doucet's back.

        Wade spins.  This is a big surprise.  Sanchez hands over
        the .38.

                                 SANCHEZ
                    You're going to need this.

        BACK TO SCENE

        Gallagher is reduced to a sniveling, whimpering mouse.
        Doucet grabs him.  Lifts the Mayor off his feet.

                                 DOUCET
                    I want to congratulate you on your
                    win.

        With his free hand, Doucet pulls out his double barrel
        handgun.  Gallagher cries.  Closes his eyes.  TWO SHOTS
        RING out.  The recipient staggers back.  Totters.  Screams
        as another BULLET enters his throat.

        If you're wondering who got the lead, it's Doucet.
        Gallagher opens his eyes.  The first two bullets pierced
        his suit and hit the monster.  Wade is some shot.  He
        continues BLOWING HOLES in Doucet.  Determined to end the
        man's nightmare of a life.  Finally Doucet hits a television
        camera.  Spins.  Falls spread-eagled onto a chair.
        Coughs blood.  Wade steps up.  Triggers.  His gun is empty.
        Doucet lurches forward.  Grabs Wade.  Nails him into the
        wall.  Throws him over a row of chairs.  Wade hits the
        floor.  Buried beneath metal chairs.  Doucet pulls him out.

                                 DOUCET
                    One... question... before I kill you...

        Wade is pulled face to face with Doucet.

                                 DOUCET
                    ...Why do... they call you... Demolition
                    Man...?

                                 SANCHEZ (V.O.)
                    Because he demolishes things, asshole.

        Doucet spins.  Sanchez stands behind him.  Laser weapon
        aimed.  He FIRES.  One shot does the trick.  Doucet falls
        back with the chair.  He jerks once and then dies.

        <u>EXT.  SUBURBAN SPLIT LEVEL (VALLEY)</u>

        Twilight.  Willy is adjusting the seat on his BMX.  Wade
        pulls up and steps out.  He's in his mid-forties.

                                 WILLY
                           (delighted)
                    Grandpa's home.

        Willy races into Wade's arms.  Cassy and Kimberly walk out
        of the house.  Wade puts Willy on the ground.  Silence.
        For a moment Wade stares into Cassy's eyes.  Then he pulls
        her over, taking her in his tight embrace.  Kimberly and
        Willy surround them.  This is nice.  This is love.

        <u>INT.  CRYO-PRISON FACILITY X23-55</u>

        HOLD ON an Inmate Pod.  Gallagher on ice.  Chilled black
        lifeless eyes.  Glossy face.  Sequestered between a Child
        Molester and a Necrophiliac.  He fits in perfectly.

        His eyes glare at us.  They are full of evil.  In a
        Cryogenic state he poses no threat.  Or does he...?

                                                          FADE OUT.
