     EXT: WINTER RIVER, CONNECTICUT -- DAY

     A  bucolic New England town,  but rather too clean and neat to be
     entirely real.  There is no visible population.

     Ominous, vibrating music.

     On Main Street, a banner proclaims:

                                COME TO THE
                          INDEPENDENCE DAY PICNIC
                               ON THE GREEN
                         WINTER RIVER, CONNECTICUT

     The   camera,   flying   over  downtown  and  several   different
     neighborhoods,  sweeps  over a rickety bridge crossing a  rapidly
     flowing  stream,  and  then up a hill to  a  large  old-fashioned
     house.   The  house stands alone on this prominence,  overlooking
     the rest of the town.  The camera lingers.

     SUDDENLY A GIANT DADDY LONGLEGS SPIDER --

     mounts  the  crest of the hill behind the  house,  pauses  for  a
     moment,  and  then starts to climb over the Victorian house in  a
     very menacing manner.

                            ADAM (v.o.)
                       You're a big fellow.

     A HAND --

     perfectly  stupendous -- reaches down out of the sky,  lies flat,
     palm up,  in the yard next to the house,  and the Daddy  Longlegs
     climbs into it.  The hand rises into the sky again.


     INT: ATTIC AND MINIATURE TOWN -- DAY

     A new angle reveals Winter River as a miniature town,  while  the
     Daddy  Longlegs  and the hand holding it are perfectly normal  in
     size.   Above the model are a complicated mechanism of sun, moon,
     clouds,  and stars -- a whole,  tiny mechanical universe to track
     the hours of the day.

     The  hand belongs to ADAM MAITLAND,  who is in his early forties,
     solid-looking  and easy-going.   Frank Capra used to make  movies
     about him.

     ADAM  and the miniature town are in an attic room of a  Victorian
     house.   The  attic roof slopes on either side,  and there are  a
     couple of windows,  quite small and low down toward the floor  at
     either end of the long room.  Almost the entire space is taken up
     by  the  miniature town.   A single door leads to a  landing  and
     staircase to the lower part of the house.

     ADAM carries the spider to the window,  kneels on the floor,  and
     pushes open the window.  The spider crawls away outside.

     ADAM's POV --

     The real Winter River lies spread out at the bottom of the hill.

     BACK TO SCENE --

     ADAM,  whistling,  goes  back to the model.   He takes a pair  of
     tweezers  in  which  he grips  an  extremely  small  sign,  whose
     lettering is so tiny we can't make it out.

     He  reaches  into the model and places the sign on the window  of
     MAITLAND'S APPLIANCE STORE on Main Street.

     INSERT -- THE SIGN

     It reads:

                             ADAM AND BARBARA
                                    ARE
                                <u>ON VACATION</u>
                                  HOORAY!

     BACK TO SCENE --

                            ADAM
                       Hooray!

     ADAM smiles down at the town as he's about to leave the room.  He
     turns  off  the  lamp that acts as sun to  the  miniature  Winter
     River.


     INT: THE HOUSE -- DAY

     A  tracking  shot  from the top of the Maitland's  house  to  the
     bottom.

     ADAM  leaves  the attic room,  and trips softly down the  stairs,
     humming a merry tune.

     On the walls as he passes are photographs of himself and  BARBARA
     standing  beside  impossibly large and silly-looking  appliances.

     ADAM  passes  down the second floor hallway.   The doors  of  the
     rooms are open,  and we pass the master bedroom, a sewing room, a
     couple of guest rooms,  bathrooms,  and so-on.   It's a big,  old
     rambling  house,  and it's decidedly old-fashioned,  homely,  and
     comfortable.   It also looks as if three generations of the  same
     family have lived in it.

     Down  the stairs into the living room,  which is decorated in the
     same fashion -- big console television,  Barcalounger,  a  living
     room  set from 1961.   Through the dining room,  with homilies in
     needlepoint on the wall:  BLESS THIS HOUSE O LORD WE PRAY /  MAKE
     IT  SAFE  BY NIGHT AND DAY / BLESS THE FOLKS WHO DWELL  WITHIN  /
     KEEP  THEM SAFE FROM HARM AND SIN.   Through the dining room door
     and into the kitchen:


     INT: KITCHEN -- DAY

     ADAM's wife BARBARA is in the kitchen.

     BARBARA has a kind of wholesome beauty that is mellowing well, as
     she  approaches middle age.   There's a hint of unfulfillment  in
     BARBARA  that gives her a little more of an edge than  ADAM.   We
     will  come  to  see that the only thing missing to  complete  the
     Maitland's happiness is a child.

     On  the table in the center of the kitchen is a large cake  about
     three  feet by two.   BARBARA is decorating it to look just  like
     the American flag.

                            ADAM
                       It's the first day of
                       our vacation, and you
                       haven't been out of the
                       kitchen since five a.m.

                            BARBARA
                       (Proudly)  I always make
                       the flag cake.

                            ADAM
                       Fifty stars, thirteen
                       stripes.  Did you get it
                       right this year?

     BARBARA  thinks  for a moment,  during which pause there  is  the
     SOUND OF A CAR DRIVING UP TO THE HOUSE.

                            BARBARA
                       I'll go see who that is.
                       You start counting.

     BARBARA goes out of the kitchen into the dining room.

     ADAM starts counting the stars by naming off the states.

                            ADAM
                       Maine.  New Hampshire.
                       Vermont.  Massachusetts
                       Connecticut.


     EXT: FRONT OF THE HOUSE -- DAY

     A bottle green Cadillac has pulled up in front of the house  next
     to the Maitland's station wagon.  When the driver's door opens, a
     well-dressed  middle aged woman steps out,  and starts resolutely
     for the front steps of the house.  (This is JANE BUTTERFIELD.)


     INT: KITCHEN -- DAY

     BARBARA comes back in.

                            ADAM
                       (Finishing with the stars)
                       They're all there.

                            BARBARA
                       It's Jane.

                            ADAM
                       Whose turn is it?

     BARBARA's face falls.

                            BARBARA
                       It's mine.

     ADAM's face lights up.

                            ADAM
                       I'm going to pick pears.

     DOORBELL rings.

     ADAM grabs up a basket by the back door and steps outside.

                            BARBARA
                       What do I tell her?

                            ADAM
                       What I told her last time.
                       And what you told her the time
                       before that.  No.


     INT: LIVING ROOM -- DAY

     BARBARA  opens  the  door.   Outside on  the  porch  stands  JANE
     BUTTERFIELD.  JANE is a tall nervous woman, who looks as if she's
     divorced  three  husbands  and buried another for  good  measure.
     She's ruthless but in her own weird way, quite pleasant.

                            BARBARA
                       Hello, Jane.

                            JANE
                       How are you, Barbara?  How's
                       the flag cake coming?  You
                       remembered the sugar this
                       year, didn't you?

                            BARBARA
                       Nobody ever forgets these
                       simple mistakes.

                            JANE
                       I'm selling lottery tickets.
                       Worthy cause.  We're sending
                       the high school honor students
                       to New York for a few days.
                       Give them a taste of real
                       city life.  How many do you
                       want?  Ten, twenty?

                            BARBARA
                       What's the prize?

                            JANE
                       Your flag cake.  That's why
                       I wanted to make sure you
                       got it right.

                            BARBARA
                       Adam and I will take just two
                       tickets.  It wouldn't look good
                       if we won our own cake.

                            JANE
                       There's something else I want
                       to talk to you about.
                       (Beat)  How would you like
                       to be rich beyond your wildest
                       dreams?

                            BARBARA
                       Jane, Adam and I are --

                            JANE
                       Don't tell me that you're
                       already rich in the things that
                       matter, because, believe me,
                       the things that matter are not
                       the things that <u>really</u> matter.

                            BARBARA
                       Last week we could get four
                       hundreds thousand for the house.
                       How much do you think we could
                       get for it this week?

                            JANE
                       Five.  No question.  This house is a
                       Property of Quality and Distinction.


     EXT: ORCHARD -- DAY

     Small pear and apple trees.  The pears are bearing now, the apple
     trees  not  yet.   This is an idyllic setting -- but is  is  also
     functional and modest.

     Birds are singing in the trees.

     ADAM  is standing in the middle of the orchard,  filling  up  his
     basket with pears.

     From the edge of the forest,  a young deer peers out at ADAM, and
     after a moment's hesitation, creeps out and into the orchard.

     ADAM  reaches forward with a pear,  and the deer takes it out  of
     his hand.

     At this moment, a lovable COLLIE runs up to ADAM, but stops short
     when  he catches sight of the deer.   The COLLIE looks up at  the
     deer, and the deer looks down at the COLLIE.

     The deer slowly turns off, back towards the forest.

                            ADAM
                       You watch out for those men
                       with the guns.

     With the deer gone off, the COLLIE throws himself at ADAM's feet,
     and rolls over on his back.  Kicking off one of his Hush Puppies,
     ADAM rubs the dog's belly with his stockinged foot.

     JIMMY, the town paperboy, rides up on his bike, ducking under the
     branches of the orchard trees.

                            JIMMY
                       Don't worry, Mr. Maitland.
                       Rocket won't bite.

                            ADAM
                       Catch, Jimmy.

     He throws him a pear.   JIMMY deftly snags it with one hand.   In
     return, JIMMY throws ADAM his paper.

                            ADAM
                       Go in the kitchen, Jimmy.
                       Your money's on the
                       counter.  And don't
                       touch the icing on
                       Barbara's cake or she'll
                       skin you alive.

     JIMMY drops his bicycle and goes in the back door of the house.


     INT: KITCHEN -- DAY

     The paper money is laid out on the counter,  as promised,  but so
     is a plate of cookies and a tall glass of milk.  JIMMY stuffs one
     of  the cookies in his mouth immediately,  and then goes to study
     the flag cake.  He begins counting the stars.

                            JIMMY
                       Hawaii.  Alaska.  New Mexico.
                       Arizona.  Wyoming.  Oklahoma.

     He  stops for a moment,  hearing the voices of JANE  and  BARBARA
     through the dining room door.


     INT: LIVING ROOM -- DAY

     JANE is at the top of her pitch.

                            JANE
                       I'll put it in the Sunday
                       Times Magazine.  Sell the
                       next day.  Some lawyer from
                       New York will snap it up in
                       two minutes.  You and Adam
                       will be able to retire.  It
                       will be like a permanent
                       vacation.

                            BARBARA
                       The only reason we like va-
                       cations is that we get to stay
                       here in the house.

     JIMMY  walks  in the door from the kitchen.   He's  carrying  the
     cookies and the milk.

                            JIMMY
                       Thank you for the cookies,
                       Mrs. Maitland.  I counted
                       your stars and they're all
                       there.  My mom bought ten
                       raffle tickets.

                            BARBARA
                       You're welcome, Jimmy.  You
                       know Mrs. Butterfield, don't
                       you?

     JANE,  prompted  by  the appearance of the paperboy,  delivers  a
     final salvo.

                            JANE
                       This house is so big.  It
                       really ought to belong to
                       people who have children.

     BARBARA  gives her a sudden wounded look.   Jane  is  immediately
     remorseful.

                            JANE (cont)
                       I didn't mean that.

     ADAM walks in from the kitchen with ROCKET.

                            ADAM
                       Give up, Jane.  Barbara and
                       I are going to stay in this
                       house forever.


     EXT: ROAD IN FRONT OF HOUSE -- DAY

     JIMMY  is racing down the hill on his  bicycle,  ROCKET  bounding
     after him.

     At  the  bottom  of the hill is a rickety  bridge,  spanning  the
     rapidly flowing Winter River.

     JIMMY's bike goes BUMPITY-BUMPITY-BUMP across the uneven  boards.
     ROCKET, however, veers off the road in order to chase a squirrel.

     JIMMY stops his bike in the middle of the bridge,  and calls back
     after ROCKET.

                            JIMMY
                       Rocket!  Leave that squirrel
                       alone!  Mr. Maitland would
                       skin you alive if he saw you
                       chasing his animals!

     But  ROCKET  does not reappear,  and JIMMY shrugs,  and rides  on
     towards town.


     EXT: FRONT OF HOUSE -- DAY

     JANE comes out the front door of the house.   She holds open  the
     front  door,  as  ADAM  and BARBARA come out with the  flag  cake
     between them.

     JANE  goes  out into the yard,  and opens the rear  of  ADAM  and
     BARBARA's station wagon.

                            JANE
                       I'll see you at the picnic,
                       won't I?

                            ADAM
                       We haven't missed the town
                       picnic since --

     He looks to BARBARA.

                            BARBARA
                       We've <u>never</u> missed it.

     JANE  starts to get into her car,  but,  glancing up at the house
     and  seeing  it as a big fat commission,  she gives it  one  more
     shot.

                            JANE
                       Six hundred fifty thousand.
                       You could move to Maui.

     ADAM and BARBARA wave,  not even bothering to reply.   JANE's car
     takes  off.   Careful  of the cake,  ADAM shuts the rear door  of
     their station wagon.   As they do, there comes into view a bumper
     sticker: WARNING!  I BRAKE FOR ANIMALS!

     ADAM and BARBARA get into the car, and drive off.

     Directly  behind  them,  over the crest of  the  hills,  comes  a
     hunter's van.  A doe is tied to the open back.


     INT: THE STATION WAGON -- DAY

     Going down the hill, and towards the bridge.

     ADAM  is  staring  with  disgust in the rearview  mirror  at  the
     hunters, who are tailgating them.

     BARBARA,  sitting close beside ADAM in the front street, does not
     notice.

                            BARBARA
                       Don't use your brakes.
                       I'm worried about the cake.

                            ADAM
                       We're going downhill.  I have
                       to use --

     BARBARA screams and points.

     ROCKET has just run out into the path of the car,  and is staring
     stupidly at the approaching vehicle.

     ADAM applies brakes violently to avoid hitting ROCKET.


     EXT: BRIDGE AND RIVER -- DAY

     The  hunters'  van smashes into the back of  ADAM  and  BARBARA's
     station wagon,  and sends it into the side of the rickety bridge.
     It crashes through the railing and hovers a moment on the edge.

     ROCKET has ambled slowly out of the way, unhurt.

     The  Hunters'  van also screeches to a halt in the middle of  the
     bridge.


     INT: THE CAR -- DAY

     A  piling has smashed through the window on the  passenger  side,
     crushing the upper part of BARBARA's arm.  She is wailing in pain
     and fright.

     ADAM attempts everything at once.   He tries to help BARBARA.  He
     tries to get out of the car to save his own skin.  He attempts to
     maneuver the car onto the bridge again.  None of this succeeds.

     The  car rocks back and forth a moment,  and then slides  forward
     toward the river.


     EXT: CAR AND BRIDGE -- DAY

     The station wagon plunges into the rushing water.   It floats for
     a moment, and then sinks like a stone.

     The hunters' van peels away from the scene of the accident.   For
     the  first  time we see an I LOVE NEW YORK bumper sticker on  the
     car, directly beneath the bloody head of the dead doe.


     UNDERWATER --

     The  station wagon floats downward with panic-stricken  ADAM  and
     BARBARA inside.   For a moment we hear their screams, then as the
     car fills up with water, the screams are cut off.


     EXT: BRIDGE AND RIVER -- DAY

     ROCKET is standing on the bridge staring into the water.

     Bubbles  of air come up from the bottom and break on the  surface
     of the water.

     The bubbles stop.

     ROCKET trots off in the direction of town.

     FADE TO BLACK.









     -----------------------------------------------------------------


     INT: THE HOUSE -- TWILIGHT

     NOISE OF A SLOW CLOCK TICKING.

     One after another, we see the rooms of the Maitland house, still,
     empty, dimly lighted.  From the top of the house to the bottom.

     The last room to be seen is the living room.

     The clock stops ticking.

     A moment of silence and stillness.

     Suddenly  and for no apparent reason the fire laid in the  hearth
     ignites and burns with a furious cheerfulness.

     BARBARA and ADAM enter, dazed, wet and bedraggled.

                            BARBARA
                       What a wonderful start to
                       our vacation.

                            ADAM
                       You'll feel better when
                       you're dry.

     ADAM  leads  her toward the fire.   He holds out his hands to  be
     warmed.   BARBARA comes up beside him.   All this time she's been
     holding her injured arm with the other hand.

                            BARBARA
                       This fire wasn't burning when
                       we left the house.

                            ADAM
                       How's your arm?

                            BARBARA
                       I'm not sure.  It feels
                       frozen.

     She holds her hands out to warm them.

     BARBARA's LEFT ARM --

     slowly slides out of her sleeve of her coat and plunges into  the
     fire.

     ADAM  and  BARBARA stare at it dumbfoundedly before ADAM  regains
     his senses and snatches it out of the fire.   Two of the  fingers
     are  burning like candles,  and BARBARA industriously blows  them
     out.

                                                             CUT TO:

     INT: LIVING ROOM: A FEW MINUTES LATER

     ADAM  and BARBARA are sitting on the couch together.   BARBARA is
     looking  away  slightly -- as one does when a doctor  is  drawing
     blood  -- while ADAM tries to reattach her arm.   He's  a  little
     unsure of the procedure, since he's never had to do it before.

                            BARBARA
                       Do you remember how we got
                       out of the car?

     ADAM gets up,  a little absently,  and wanders to the front door.
     He peers out.

                            ADAM
                       I don't think we survived
                       that crash.

     BARBARA tests her arm by turning it in the shoulder socket.   She
     clenches and unclenches her fist.  They work fine.

                            BARBARA
                       Works.

     ADAM opens the door and steps out onto the front porch.


     EXT: FRONT PORCH -- TWILIGHT

     A  gorgeous sunset.   ADAM's face is painted with the color.   He
     stands  at the top of the steps leading down to the  front  yard.
     BARBARA  stands  just  inside the  open  threshold,  looking  out
     worriedly.

                            ADAM
                       (Quiet sarcasm)  The end
                       of a perfect day.

     ADAM starts to step down to the yard.

                            BARBARA
                       But we can't be dead.
                       We're here!

     ADAM  steps  off  the  last  step  into  the  yard  and  promptly
     disappears.

                            BARBARA
                       Adam!


     EXT: THE GREAT VOID

     ADAM is nowhere.   There's no ground, no sky, nothing to stand on
     or hold onto or give boundaries or distance.   Just vast nothing.
     Not white and not colored either.  Noise of a CLOCK TICKING.

     ADAM  looks about in surprise,  and doesn't like what he  doesn't
     see.  He turns right around to head back up the steps.

     There are no steps.

                            ADAM
                       Barbara?

     He  runs off a little in the distance,  and calls again from over
     there.

                            ADAM
                       (Quietly)  Where are you,
                       darling?

     He goes even farther away.

     IN THE FOREGROUND --

     an  enormous  geared  wheel -- the size of  a  man  -- rolls  by,
     tearing  up the unseamed ground.   Something pours up out of  the
     tear -- ooze or stuffing.

     ADAM  runs forward and stares after the wheel,  which is now  out
     of sight.

     TWO SMALLER GEARS --

     looking very much like components of a giant watch -- spin  along
     behind him.   One of them veers suddenly towards him,  and though
     ADAM  jumps  out of the way,  the gear snags his trouser leg  and
     shreds it.

     A PERFECTLY ENORMOUS GEAR --

     comes barrelling towards him.   ADAM leaps out of its  way.   The
     gear turns, fish-tailing, kicking up ooze and stuffing.

     ADAM  flings  himself suddenly to the right,  but trips into  the
     path  of the gear.   As he's about to be crushed,  he's  suddenly
     jerked up to safety.


     EXT: FRONT PORCH -- NIGHT

     It's BARBARA who's grabbed him,  and quite evidently saved his --
     not life, perhaps -- but existence.  He's shaken, breathless.

     BARBARA  stares  at  him,  as if wondering what  he's  just  been
     through.

                            ADAM
                       (Weakly)  You saved my --
                       uh -- something.

                            BARBARA
                       Two hours.

                            ADAM
                       What?

                            BARBARA
                       That's how long you were
                       gone.

     Over WINTER RIVER,  the Independence Day fireworks explode.  ADAM
     and BARBARA's faces are painted with the light.


     INT: LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

     BARBARA leads ADAM into the house.

                            ADAM
                       Anything happen while I
                       was away?

                            BARBARA
                       I made a couple of small
                       discoveries.

     She  is  standing in front of the mirror over the hearth  mantel.
     On the mantel is BARBARA's prized collection of porcelain horses.
     ADAM comes to stand beside her.   They look into the mirror,  and
     there is no reflection of them.

     BARBARA picks up one of the horses, and trots it through the air.
     The horse <u>is</u> imaged in the mirror.

                            BARBARA
                       There's that, and there's
                       this.

     She points to a book that is sitting on the coffee-table.  It's a
     massive sheaf of indexed pages in a bureaucratic-looking  binder.
     It looks like this year's tax code.

     CU: Its title is HANDBOOK FOR THE RECENTLY DECEASED.

                            BARBARA
                       I don't know where this
                       came from.


     INT: BEDROOM -- NIGHT

     ADAM  is already in bed,  reading from the Handbook.   BARBARA is
     walking about the room, getting ready for bed.  It's evident that
     they're going through a ritual of sorts that they practiced every
     night of their married lives.

                            BARBARA
                       I don't like situations like
                       this.  I hate it when I'm not
                       in control.  So just tell me
                       the basics.

                            ADAM
                       What do you want to know?

                            BARBARA
                       There are a thousand things
                       we want to know.  Is this a
                       punishment?  Or is it a re-
                       ward?  Are we halfway to
                       heaven or are we halfway
                       to hell?  Why did you dis-
                       appear when you walked off
                       the front porch?  And how long
                       is it going to last?  That's
                       for starters.

                            ADAM
                       This book isn't arranged
                       that way.

     INSERT: WARNING PAGE IN BOOK (as ADAM reads:)

                            ADAM (cont)
                       Warning.  Proceed step by
                       step through this manual.
                       Do not begin on Section
                       Two until you have fully
                       mastered the concepts con-
                       tained in Section One.

                            BARBARA
                       Then start with Section One.

     ADAM turns the page and reads aloud.

                            ADAM
                       (Reading)  Section One.
                       Behavior at the Funeral.
                       Paragraph One.  Lie very
                       still.

                            BARBARA
                       That's starting at the
                       beginning all right.
                       Anyway, we didn't have
                       a funeral... that I can
                       remember.

                            ADAM
                       I think I'm going to skip
                       ahead a few pages.

     BARBARA is standing inside the open closet door.   As ADAM talks,
     she glances at her non-reflection in the mirror.  She touches the
     surface  of  the  mirror,  and  her  eyes go  wide  as  her  hand
     penetrates the surface.

                            ADAM
                       This book reads like the Tax
                       Code.  I don't see anything
                       about "Rewards and Punish-
                       ments" or "Heaven and Hell".
                       Wait, maybe this is something,
                       under "Geographical and Temporal
                       Perimeters."  (Reading)
                       "Functional perimeters vary
                       from manifestation to mani-
                       festation."  It really does
                       sound like the IRS had a
                       hand in this.

     He looks up but BARBARA is nowhere to be seen in the room.

                            ADAM
                       Barbara!  Where --

     The  closet  door swings slowly open,  so  that  the  full-length
     mirror inside the door is directly facing ADAM in bed.

     But it's not ADAM who's reflected, holding the Handbook on top of
     the covers, it's BARBARA.

                            ADAM
                       How did you get in there?

                            BARBARA
                       I walked through.  It's 
                       easy.

                            ADAM
                       What's it like?


     INT: BEDROOM IN MIRROR -- NIGHT

     The  bedroom  is reversed,  but there are other things  different
     too.   The  room just fades out on the edges,  and beyond is  the
     great void that ADAM was in earlier.

     BARBARA begins to feel frightened.   She peers at her side of the
     mirror and sees ADAM in bed on the other side.  The image is dark
     and fading -- as if the door between the two worlds were  closing
     off.

                            BARBARA
                       It's --

     The mirror grows darker.

     On  all sides of her,  the walls of the room fade away  entirely.
     The room tilts, and the furniture slides away into the void.

     At  the  last possible moment,  BARBARA bolts through the  mirror
     back into the real world.


     INT: THE REAL BEDROOM -- NIGHT

     ADAM looks at his wife.  BARBARA is shaken.

                            ADAM
                       The handbook discourages
                       that sort of experimentation.
                       Trans-dimensional insta-
                       bilities, whatever that
                       means.

                            BARBARA
                       I've got a pretty good
                       idea.


     EXT: WINTER RIVER DOWNTOWN MAIN STREET -- DAY

     Showing  the appliance store,  with a black wreath on top of  the
     GONE ON VACATION sign.

     Across the street is JANE BUTTERFIELD'S REAL ESTATE AGENCY.

     IN THE WINDOW OF THE REAL ESTATE AGENCY --

     JANE  is  squeezed  between  the glass and a  large  cork  board,
     bearing the legend AVAILABLE PROPERTIES OF DISTINCTION.   She  is
     putting up a new photograph of ADAM and BARBARA's house.

     At  the  same time,  she's talking into a telephone with  a  long
     cord.

                            JANE
                       It came out of probate only
                       two days ago.  This entire
                       house is replete with extras
                       and amenities sure to please
                       the discriminating buyer, such
                       as yourself.  (Beat)  I know
                       you'll love the place, Mrs.
                       Deetz.  And so will your il-
                       lustrious husband and your
                       marvellous three -- two
                       children.  (Beat)  There is
                       a master bedroom suite con-
                       sisting of a bedroom of di-
                       mensions approximately fif-
                       teen by twenty-two feet, two
                       large walk-in closets with
                       full-length bevelled mirrors,
                       a third --

     The  fit  in  the window is so tight that JANE  gets  stuck.   In
     trying to get out,  she slips and falls sideways,  and is  caught
     even  more securely in the twisted telephone cord.   Two children
     stand in front of the window passively watching her distress.

                            JANE
                       Help!  Help!


     INT: ATTIC AND MODEL TOWN -- DAY

     The model town looks to be thriving.  ADAM's obviously had plenty
     of time for his hobby lately.

     Right  now,  ADAM  is  setting up a small monument  in  the  town
     cemetery.   It  reads ADAM AND BARBARA MAITLAND / UNITED IN LIFE/
     UNDIVIDED IN DEATH.

                            ADAM
                       Do you think this is
                       heaven?

                            BARBARA
                       In heaven there wouldn't
                       be stains on the wall-
                       paper.

                            ADAM
                       This is how I always
                       imagined heaven.  Being in
                       this house.  With you.
                       With time to do all the things
                       I never had time to do before.


     INT: GUEST BEDROOM -- DAY

     This is the bedroom with ADAM and BARBARA's wedding photograph in
     it.

     BARBARA  stands leaning against the sill of the  window,  looking
     out over distant Winter River.

     ADAM comes in behind her.

                            ADAM
                       Cabin fever?

                            BARBARA
                       What?

                            ADAM
                       Do you feel trapped?  We're
                       not allowed to leave the house.

                            BARBARA
                       No.  I don't feel trapped.
                       I never imagined death would
                       be like this.  I'm so happy.
                       Sometimes I just wonder how
                       long it's going to last.  How
                       long we're going to be allowed
                       to stay here.


     INT: LIVING ROOM -- DAY

     BARBARA and ADAM are dancing to Artie Shaw.  The Manual lies open
     on the coffee table.

     ADAM continues the conversation from upstairs.

                            ADAM
                       It'll take us at least a
                       hundred years to get through
                       that manual.

                            BARBARA
                       I don't know why you keep
                       trying.  It hasn't told us
                       one useful thing yet.

                            ADAM
                       At least we know we're supposed
                       to stay away from shellfish.

     They dance on for a minute, and then, while dancing, a thoughtful
     expression creeps over ADAM's features.

                            BARBARA
                       What are you thinking about?

                            ADAM
                       I was just wondering who
                       bought the appliance store.

     They stop dancing.  The music stops as well.

     A terrible thought has occurred to them both.

                            BARBARA
                       I wonder who's going to buy
                       this house.  You know how
                       desperate Jane was to sell it.

                            ADAM
                       I guess we just have to hope
                       she sells it to someone nice.

     AN OMINOUS RUMBLE --

     like  a  4.0 earthquake shakes the  house.   Glass  rattles,  the
     ceramic horses on the mantelpiece jump around.   BARBARA and ADAM
     look at one another with misgiving.

     The  rumble builds to a climax,  there is a loud metallic squeal,
     and then a crash...

     A MOVING VAN RAMP --

     smashes open the front door and crashes down into the foyer.

     BARBARA and ADAM --

     half  expect  a division of Marines to storm down  the  ramp  but
     instead --

     A TEN-FOOT ELECTRIC BLUE ITALIAN LEATHER COUCH --

     slides smoothly down the ramp.  On the couch sits DELIA DEETZ.

     DELIA   is  relentlessly  New  York,   relentlessly  fashionable,
     relentlessly thin -- a totally self-assured Joan Rivers.

     She  is also a woman with a mission -- to gut BARBARA and  ADAM's
     house and remake it in her own very upscale image.

     DELIA's  gaze is on the living room,  but she looks through  ADAM
     and  BARBARA  as if they weren't even there (which  to  her  eyes
     they're not).

     The  couch crashes into the base of the staircase,  smashing  the
     newell  post and several of the balusters.   One of the balusters
     falls at Delia's side.  She grasps it like a scepter.

     Two MOVING MEN rush down the ramp.

                            MOVING MAN #1
                       Sorry about that, Mrs. Deetz.

                            DELIA
                       Don't worry.  It was going
                       anyway.

     Staggered by DELIA's grand entrance,  BARBARA looks toward  ADAM,
     but  he has disappeared.   Flustered,  BARBARA glances around the
     room, shakes herself experimentally, then with a look of surprise
     on her face that it works -- disappears herself.

     Still holding the baluster, DELIA gets up off the couch and moves
     into  the  living  room,  surveying it with  an  odd  mixture  of
     ambition, contempt, and resolution.

     Behind  her,  the two MOVING MEN bring in a matching blue leather
     armchair.  In the armchair sits LYDIA DEETZ.

     LYDIA  is  the  <u>nec  plus ultra</u> of  whatever  is  fashionable  in
     sixteen-year-old  SoHo girls -- this week that makes her a  DEATH
     ROCKER.   She's  has on a black tunic emblazoned with alternating
     rows of skulls and crucifixes.  She's also wearing a hand grenade
     baldolier and a necklace of human finger bones.   Also around her
     neck are a couple of very expensive cameras.

     LYDIA is already taking photographs, not of the new house, but of
     the moving men.   LYDIA is cool,  LYDIA is sullen,  LYDIA is  her
     father's daughter by his first marriage.

     The  MOVING  MEN still hold up the chair,  waiting for  DELIA  to
     decide where she wants it.  LYDIA calmly surveys the house with a
     cold eye.

                            LYDIA
                       We gave up sixty-five hundred
                       square feet of prime loft
                       space on Prince Street for
                       this?

                            DELIA
                       Shut up, Lydia.  You're too
                       young to comprehend fluctuations
                       in the real estate market on a
                       nationwide or even regionwide
                       scale.  This place was a
                       fucking steal.

     DELIA  signals wearily that the MOVING MEN can put the chair down
     anywhere.

                            DELIA (cont)
                       Your first job is to get all
                       this other crap out of here.

     LYDIA  hops  down out of the chair,  and comes farther  into  the
     living room.

                            LYDIA
                       Jesus.  Who lived here?  Norman
                       Rockwell?

                            DELIA
                       Where is Charles?

                            LYDIA
                       Checking out the kitchen.

     That's  the  cue  for CHARLES DEETZ,  who comes  in  through  the
     swinging  door,  and  across the dining  room.   He's  holding  a
     butcher  knife  in one hand,  and a massive meat cleaver  in  the
     other.

     CHARLES is not exactly the equivalent of his wife, being at heart
     a basically pleasant man.   But pleasant isn't in this year,  and
     CHARLES does his best to be off-handed and brittle.

                            CHARLES
                       Only things in the whole damn
                       kitchen worth saving.  You
                       wouldn't believe the kind of
                       junk those people ate.  I found
                       bottled Thousand Island in the
                       refrigerator.  Hungry Man
                       Dinners in the freezer.  A
                       whole case of Spam in the
                       pantry.  They probably died
                       of gastronomic boredom.

     At  the front door,  the fourth member of the DEETZ family climbs
     over the moving ramp.   This is CATHY DEETZ, nine years old.  She
     is  dressed  totally SoHo,  but there's something off  about  the
     outfit -- as if she's not quite comfortable with the  look.   She
     gazes around the living room with obvious pleasure.

                            CATHY
                       A real house.  It's totally
                       great.  I can't believe it.

                            CHARLES
                       You really like this place,
                       don't you, honey?

                            CATHY
                       You bet.

                            LYDIA
                       You're such a weenie.

     A  VIOLENT FALSETTO SCREAM turns the DEETZ family's attention  to
     the front windows.

                            OTHO (o.s.)
                       HELP!

     Caught  in  the  window frame is a massive body,  wedged  at  the
     waist.   The short,  stubby legs,  dressed in the world's largest
     pair  of Georgio Armani slacks,  protrude into the  living  room,
     waving  frantically.   A  pair of expensive Italian  loafers  are
     kicked  off  the  feet revealing a pair  of  expensive  patterned
     socks.

     By their feet shall ye know them.

                            DELIA
                       It's Otho.

                            CHARLES
                       Otho, why didn't you just come
                       in the door?

     OTHO's voice as if from a great distance.

                            OTHO (o.s.)
                       It's bad luck.

                            CATHY
                       Hold your breath and we'll
                       pull.

     With  much  concerted  effort,  the entire DEETZ family  at  last
     manages to pull OTHO into the living room.

     All  this  while  the MOVING MEN are variously  carting  out  the
     handsome old furniture and bringing in the hideous new furniture.

     OTHO is Robert Morley at his most obscenely fat and faggoty.  But
     he's  not  all  fat and fun -- this  customer  carries  emotional
     weight as well.

     As  OTHO  is  pulled through the window he is  holding  onto  the
     curtains  for  support.   And  when he is at  last  all  the  way
     through,  and upright on his feet, he suddenly gives a tremendous
     yank.   The whole drapery apparatus,  including valences, crashes
     to the floor.

                            OTHO
                       That was the single most
                       unattractive window treatment
                       I have ever seen in the entire
                       of my existence.

                            DELIA
                       I'm so glad you could come,
                       Otho.

     OTHO is looking around the room with an eye of quiet horror.

                            OTHO
                       Well, when you told me about
                       this place, I had an intuition.
                       Call it a hunch -- that it was
                       going to be a fabled monstrosity of
                       a house.  And it certainly us.
                       Charles, you're going to have
                       to write two romances, a western,
                       and three of those wretched
                       detective novels to afford what
                       I'm going to have to do to this
                       place.

                            CHARLES
                       That's fine, Otho.  I'm starting
                       work as soon as the word processors
                       get here.  This country air.  I'm
                       going to be able to write twelve
                       books a year instead of just eight.
                       I can feel it already -- plots.
                       Plots crowding in on every side of
                       me.  Plots mean books, and books
                       mean money, and with money you buy
                       the things you haven't got.  Like
                       fabulous houses, in fabulous, fabulous
                       Connecticut.

     During  this  speech  OTHO has been  surreptitiously  posing  for
     LYDIA's camera, while DELIA pokes about the room with disdain.

                            OTHO
                       Is the rest of the house as bad
                       as this?

                            DELIA
                       The rest of the house is worse.
                       When can you and I get started?

                            OTHO
                       No time like the present, as my
                       wicked stepmother used to say.

     With  an unexpected and dramatic sweep of his hand,  OTHO  sweeps
     BARBARA's  entire collection of ceramic and porcelain horses from
     the mantelpiece.  They all crash to the hearth -- except for two,
     which CATHY dives to catch in either hand.

                            CATHY
                       Otho, that's terrible.

                            OTHO
                       My sentiments exactly.

     He  takes  one of the porcelain horses out of  CATHY's  hand  and
     flings it into the fireplace.

     CATHY  manages  to save one by hiding it in  her  pocket.   CATHY
     glances  into  the  mantel mirror,  and sees  the  reflection  of
     BARBARA, standing on the staircase, with a look of despair on her
     face.

     CATHY whirls around.

     BARBARA is no longer there.

     CATHY starts to say something, but she's pre-empted by OTHO.

                            OTHO
                       Delia, let's get this show
                       on the road.

     Then  out  of the pockets of his size 56 Georgio  Armani  jacket,
     OTHO  takes  two  cans of spray paint -- the  kind  the  graffiti
     artists  use -- and shakes them as if they were castanets.   They
     certainly sound like it.


     INT: UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

     At one end,  near the stairs leading up to the attic, BARBARA and
     ADAM are slumped against opposite walls.

                            ADAM
                       How did this happen?  We didn't
                       even see Jane showing off the
                       house.  And now it's already sold.

                            BARBARA
                       Remember when that damn manual
                       got us stuck in the chimney for
                       three days?  That's when it
                       happened.  (With vehemence that
                       surprises even BARBARA) God I
                       hate those people.  That woman
                       wants to destroy my house.

                            ADAM
                       What can we do about it though?
                       We're ghosts.

                            BARBARA
                       (Adamant)  Right.  We're ghosts.

     OTHO  and DELIA appear,  coming up the stairs at the opposite end
     of the hallway.

                            OTHO
                       We're dealing with negative
                       entertainment potential here.
                       I mean there's absolutely
                       no flow-through.

     They're rounded the bed,  and OTHO looks down the hallway.   It's
     empty.  ADAM and BARBARA are no longer there.

                            DELIA
                       What's wrong?

                            OTHO
                       I thought I saw something.

     DELIA turns and spray-paints on the wall -- probably in  luminous
     orange -- the word ECRU.

                            DELIA
                       Okay?

                            OTHO
                       You read my mind.  I love
                       clients who can read my mind.
                       I don't think people realize
                       how strong a connection there
                       is between interior decoration
                       and the supernatural.

     DELIA  and OTHO have reached the first door on the right.   DELIA
     opens the door and they step inside.

                            DELIA
                       This will be Lydia's room.


     INT: LYDIA'S ROOM -- DAY

     It's not LYDIA's room yet,  of course,  because it still has  the
     MAITLAND's  furniture  in it -- it's merely an old-fashioned  and
     little-used guest bedroom.

                            DELIA
                       What do you think?

                            OTHO
                       Viridian?

                            DELIA
                       Call it Graveyard Green
                       and she'll love it.

     OTHO  spray-paints the word VIRIDIAN on the wall -- right over  a
     wedding picture of ADAM and BARBARA.

     Behind DELIA and OTHO,  the room's closet door swings slowly open
     with an ominous CREAK.

     DELIA and OTHO turn that way, with a suggestion of dread.

     BARBARA --

     stands inside the closet.   She grins a ghastly grin,  grasps her
     temples,  and tears off her face,  leaving nothing but muscle and
     bone beneath.  Her eyeballs dangle on her cheeks.

     DELIA and OTHO stare aghast.

                            OTHO
                       Well, we just have to hope that
                       the other closets are bigger
                       than this one.

     He walks over and slams the door in BARBARA's contorted face.


     INT: HALLWAY -- SAME TIME

     DELIA and OTHO come out of LYDIA's bedroom.

                            OTHO
                       This whole house smells so
                       <u>dowdy</u>.  Whole lifetimes
                       of dowdiness.  Generations
                       of dowdiness.

                            DELIA
                       The master bedroom suite.

     DELIA  opens  a door on the opposite side of the hallway  -- ADAM
     and BARBARA's old room.


     INT: MASTER BEDROOM -- SAME TIME

     The  room looks as if BARBARA and ADAM left it just a  few  hours
     ago.    DELIA  and  OTHO  poke  around,  the  crassest  of  crass
     intruders.

     OTHO goes over to the closet door,  and opens it -- but before he
     actually looks inside, his attention is drawn back to DELIA.

                            DELIA
                       I was thinking of a pale
                       ochre.

     OTHO   picks  up  a  porcelain  figurine  he  finds  particularly
     offensive.

                            OTHO
                       I was thinking dynamite.

     He  tosses  the  figuring,  then turns and looks in  the  closet.
     We're  expecting  another  apparition  -- but  it's  just  ADAM's
     clothes.  OTHO fingers the material with distaste.

                            OTHO (cont)
                       What happened to the people
                       who lived here before?

                            DELIA
                       They died.

                            OTHO
                       Yes of course, but <u>how</u> did
                       they die?

     DELIA  has  gone over to the bathroom door,  and pushed  it  wide
     open.  But before she goes in, she stops a moment to think.

                            DELIA
                       I think they drowned.

     Behind DELIA, in the bathroom, the old-fashioned bathtub suddenly
     overflows with vile water.   ADAM's face-down bloated corpse bobs
     to  the  surface,  and  then suddenly spills out onto  the  tiled
     floor, flipping over to land face up.  His head, drowned stare is
     ghastly.

     DELIA stares downward directly at the corpse,  then she points at
     it.

                            DELIA
                       Otho, I cannot live with
                       these tiles.

     The bathroom is now empty.  No water, no drowned corpse.


     EXT: SIDE AND BACK OF HOUSE -- DAY

     CATHY has come out the front door and has gone around the side of
     the house, exploring her new home with wonder and delight.

     She reaches the orchard at the back of the house.   The pears are
     no longer bearing,  but the apples are now.   She plucks one from
     the trees and bites into it.

     CATHY  is suddenly pushed forward,  nearly  falling.   Recovering
     herself, she whirls around.  She is staring into the face of

     ADAM'S DEER.

     For a moment,  CATHY is startled and a little frightened.   She's
     not used to wildlife.  Then she recovers.

                            CATHY
                       Oh.  You're hungry.

     She gives him her apple to eat.

     A  second-floor window is suddenly flung open at the back of  the
     house, and DELIA leans far out.

                            DELIA
                       RABIES!  RABIES!
                       CATHY!  RUN!

     The DEER drops the apple from its mouth,  and bolts back into the
     forest.

     CATHY stares after it.


     INT: HALLWAY -- DAY

     OTHO and DELIA comes out of another room.

                            OTHO
                       The new Silver Palate cookbook
                       has a wonderful recipe for
                       terrine of venison.  (Wearily)
                       Is there much more of this?

                            DELIA
                       There's Cathy's room.  But we
                       don't even have to look in
                       there.  She'll love whatever
                       you do to it.  She's such a
                       little sheep.

                            OTHO
                       Oh, as long as we're here...

     OTHO reaches out and turns the knob on the third bedroom door.

     The  door swings ominously open on CATHY's room.   This had  been
     BARBARA's  sewing room,  and is furnished accordingly -- straight
     out of Better Homes and Gardens 1963.

     There  is  a  difference however because on the rag  rug  in  the
     middle  of the floor lies the headless corpse of  ADAM  MAITLAND.
     Standing  over him,  holding in one hand a long knife and in  the
     other ADAM's blood- and gore-dripping head,  is BARBARA -- with a
     maniacal look on her face.

                            OTHO
                       How ghastly.

                            DELIA
                       An honest-to-God sewing
                       room.

     Inside the room, the eyes of ADAM's severed head open and look up
     at BARBARA.

                            ADAM'S HEAD
                       They don't see us.  They can't
                       hear us.

     Outside, DELIA is shaking her head.

                            DELIA
                       The woman who lived here had
                       the aesthetic instincts of
                       Betty Crocker.

                            BARBARA
                       I'm going to get her.

                            DELIA
                       I cannot convey to you the
                       extent to which this house
                       <u>bores</u> me.

                            OTHO
                       I'm not so sure about that.
                       I think this place probably
                       has real atmosphere.  Once you
                       get out all this tacky furniture,
                       strip off the wallpaper, take
                       down a few walls, enlarge the
                       first-floor windows, alter the
                       traffic patterns, re-do the
                       exterior, call in the landscapers,
                       and -- perhaps -- give some
                       thought to a solarium for
                       rare cacti -- once you do all
                       that, the place might just be
                       livable.  Isn't there a third
                       floor?

                            DELIA
                       Attic space.

                            OTHO
                       Let's see.  Maybe we could turn
                       it into a media room.

     They head up the stairs to the attic.


     INT: CATHY'S ROOM -- SAME TIME

     ADAM'S HEAD has a look of terror on it.

                            ADAM'S HEAD
                       Oh God.  I forgot to lock
                       the attic door.

     ADAM's headless body jumps up off the floor and rushes out of the
     room.


     INT: STAIRCASE TO THE ATTIC -- SAME TIME

     OTHO  and DELIA climbing.   The headless corpse rushes past them,
     around the bend in the stairs and out of sight.

                            DELIA
                       Did you feel something?

                            OTHO
                       I felt something cold.


     INT: LANDING OUTSIDE ATTIC DOOR -- SAME TIME

     The headless corpse rushes through the open door into the attic.


     INT: ATTIC LANDING -- SAME TIME

     DELIA tries the knob.  The door is locked.

                            OTHO
                       You don't have a key?

                            DELIA
                       Maybe Charles does.

                            OTHO
                       I have a feeling there's
                       something interesting behind
                       this door.


     INT: CATHY'S BEDROOM -- SAME TIME

     BARBARA still holding ADAM'S HEAD.

                            ADAM'S HEAD
                       Whew!  That was close.  (Sighs)
                       What's the use of tearing your
                       head off in front of people if
                       they can't see you?

                            BARBARA
                       I can't live with this.

                            ADAM
                       We have to.  We're dead.

                            BARBARA
                       I'm getting out of here.

     She puts down his head on an end table and storms out.

                            ADAM
                       Barbara, where are you
                       going?


     INT: KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATER

     BARBARA  storms in,  straight from the room upstairs.   She heads
     straight  for the back door.   Just as she reaches for the  door,
     ADAM comes in -- putting his head back on.

                            ADAM
                       Don't go out there.  We don't
                       know --

                            BARBARA
                       I can't stay inside this house
                       a minute more.  Not one minute.

     She  flings  open  the door  and  steps  outside.   She  promptly
     disappears.

                            ADAM
                       Barbara!


     EXT: THE SURFACE OF SATURN'S MOON TITAN

     BARBARA  is on Titan with an enormous Saturn looming in the  sky.
     She looks around with wonder and some fear.

     A sulfur volcano erupts in the distance.

     A meteor crashes with a lurid explosion.

     As from a great distance she hears ADAM's voice.

                            ADAM
                       Barbara!

     She  turns  slowly in the dense sand that covers the  surface  of
     this distant moon.

     BARBARA'S POV --

     ADAM is struggling towards her.  Behind him, hovering isolated in
     the air, is the kitchen door.

     BACK TO SCENE --

     ADAM at last catches up to her.

     Behind them,  something is burrowing rapidly towards them through
     the  sand.   The  Something looks as if it might be right out  of
     DUNE.

     BARBARA  and  ADAM watch for a moment,  and then realize that  it
     just might be a very fine idea if they got the hell out of there.
     They turn and run towards the kitchen door.

     The kitchen door has moved, but they veer in the new direction.

     The  Something gets right up to them and rises out of  the  sand.
     Whatever it is is very big, very nasty, and very hungry.

     ADAM and BARBARA slip and sink in the sand as they are pursued by
     THE BEAST.   They make it through the door just in time, swing it
     open and hurl themselves through.

     The door shuts with a bang.

     The  BEAST roars and roars in frustration,  howling to the ringed
     planet.


     INT: THE KITCHEN -- DAY

     The  kitchen  is very much as it was when ADAM and  BARBARA  were
     alive, and boy it sure feels good after a stint on Titan.

     BARBARA, weeping, throws herself in ADAM's arms.

                            ADAM
                       It's okay, kiddo.  This house
                       may not be heaven for us any
                       more, but at least it isn't
                       hell.

     As if demolishing ADAM's assurances, a 2500-pound, gleaming, six-
     burner,  double-oven  Vulcan stove crashes through the  breakfast
     nook windows, and drops into place.

     Outside  can  be seen the truck and crane  which  delivered  this
     monstrous piece of culinary extravagance.

     BARBARA and ADAM duck out of its path,  stumbling into the dining
     room.


     INT: DINING ROOM -- DAY

     Where  they  are greeted with hot blasts of noisy steam from  the
     guns   of  the  WALLAPAPER  REMOVERS,   dressed  in  satanic  red
     jumpsuits, wearing Walkmans that resemble horns.

     BARBARA and ADAM stumble through to the living room, where --


     INT: LIVING ROOM -- DAY

     -- they  are bombarded with plaster splinters and dust,  and  the
     ear-shattering  noise  of drills,  hammers,  and  electric  saws,
     carving  up  the  ceiling to make room for  DELIA's  water  clock
     (which we'll see later).

     Aghast, BARBARA and ADAM flee up the stairs to the second floor.

     AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS --

     A  six-foot diameter spool of cable comes barrelling down towards
     them,  in  a parody of RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK.   They rush  back
     down the stairs,  and then,  without knowing how they  accomplish
     it,  ADAM  and BARBARA make a deft and ghostly hurdle over it  to
     the second floor landing.


     INT: SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY -- DAY

     They're not out of this SoHo hades yet.

     As  they make their way down the hallway,  they run the  gauntlet
     past  every open door.   Outside LYDIA's room,  ADAM and  BARBARA
     pause and glance in the open door, looking for refuge.  A HUNDRED
     AND  TWENTY  DECIBELS OF EAR-SHATTERING DEATH ROCK send  them  on
     down the hall,  where next they are driven against the wall by  a
     JET  STREAM of hot water -- the plumbers' error in the  bathroom.
     With  the  plumbers' curses ringing in their ears,  they  try  to
     hurry on towards the attic stairway.

     But  just as they pass the doorway of the master bedroom,  a six-
     foot  chest  of drawers sails out on  caster  wheels,  separating
     them,  plowing on through the open doorway opposite, and smashing
     through the window.  A moment later we hear its SPLINTERING CRASH
     on the ground outside.

                            BARBARA
                       That's been in my family
                       two hundred years.

     ADAM drags her on.

     Just  outside the door of CHARLES's study,  when they have nearly
     reached their goal (the second flight of stairs to the attic),  a
     shower of electrical sparks and a loud crackling pour over  them,
     from an ELECTRICIAN rewiring for CHARLES's computers.

     ADAM's  entire body is briefly outlined in the electrical  storm.
     This quickly subsides, except for a remaining charge on his hand.
     BARBARA tries to beat out this painful electrocution,  while ADAM
     jumps around in evident pain.

     When at last the charge dissipates,  ADAM finds that his hand  is
     black and smoking.

     ADAM  and  BARBARA  rush up the stairs to the  attic,  and  throw
     themselves through the door into their sole refuge.


     INT: ATTIC -- DAY

     ADAM and BARBARA.

                            ADAM
                       Barbara, we're trapped in
                       this house forever.


     EXT: FRONT YARD -- DAY

     The  entire  front  yard  is  filled with  trucks  and  vans  and
     automobiles.   These include vehicles and representatives of  the
     telehone  company,   the  television  cable  company,   plumbers,
     electricians,  kitchen  supply houses,  computer supply services,
     Goodwill and St Vincent DePaul, and whatever else there might be.

     In  the  road  in  front  of  the  house  are  several  cars   of
     rubbernecking locals,  astonished by all the activity.   The City
     has come to Town.

     We see these small vignettes, and perhaps others as well.

     Moving  men  going in with very modern and  expensive  furniture,
     colliding with the charity men coming out with ADAM and BARBARA's
     furniture and personal belongings.

     CHARLES in deep conversation with several men who stand with long
     lengths  of cable draped over their shoulders.   He is distracted
     by a large crane on the side of the house which is trying to  get
     a  stainless-steel  refrigerator -- even larger than  the  Vulcan
     stove -- through the broken breakfast nook window.

     DELIA is standing at the door of the barn/garage,  directing half
     a  dozen  fine  art  movers in the placement of  her  gallery  of
     sculptures.   These are colossal,  nightmarish images constructed
     in  an  improbably  combination of  welded  steel  and  feathers.

     LYDIA is under everybody's feet,  relentlessly photographing  the
     operation.

     CATHY  is  simply standing out of the way,  as if  frightened  of
     being trampled.

     CATHY'S POV --

     She  looks  at the whole house from the bottom to the  top.   And
     when  she reaches the top,  <u>she sees BARBARA and ADAM's faces  in</u>
     <u>the window.</u>

     BACK TO SCENE --

     CATHY blinks hard.   Her mouth drops open.   She looks all around
     -- as if she'd just seen a ghost or two.

     JANE BUTTERFIELD's car pulls up,  and JANE gets out.  She surveys
     the whole business, and looks pleasantly impressed.  She waves to
     CHARLES but he doesn't see her.  Then JANE catches sight of CATHY
     and comes over, squeezing between two vans.

                            JANE
                       Boy, when you city people
                       do something, you do it
                       right, don't you?

                            CATHY
                       Did you know the people who
                       used to live here?

                            JANE
                       They were my best friends in
                       the whole world.  I know they
                       would have been pleased to
                       know it was <u>your</u> family
                       who brought their house.

     JANE hands a key to the CATHY.

                            JANE (cont)
                       Here, darling.

                            CATHY
                       What is this?

                            JANE
                       It's a key to the attic.  Your
                       father asked me to drop it by.
                       Actually it's not a key to the
                       attic, but it's a skeleton key.
                       It'll open any door in the world.
                       Will you give it to your father?
                       And tell him if I can do anything
                       else, just call.

     JANE  goes back towards her car.   After a few steps,  she  looks
     back.

                            JANE
                       You're going to be very happy
                       here.  I can see it in your
                       face.

     CATHY smiles back,  and then her face turns serious as she  looks
     back up at the attic windows.

     CATHY'S POV --

     Nothing -- and no one -- there.

     BACK TO SCENE --

     CATHY is startled by a voice -- LYDIA's.

                            LYDIA
                       Hey!

     LYDIA snaps a picture of CATHY.

                            LYDIA (cont)
                       You look dazed.

                            CATHY
                       The sun was in my eyes.

     CATHY surreptitiously slips the skeleton key into her pocket.

                            LYDIA
                       Delia says Move Your Ass.
                       Everybody's got to help today.

     CATHY  looks  up.   DELIA is impatiently waving her over  to  the
     barn.   More  sculpture  -- worse than before -- is being  carted
     inside.


     INT: ATTIC -- DAY

     ADAM  and  BARBARA are lying on the floor,  looking  out  of  the
     window at all that is going on.

                            BARBARA
                       That little girl saw us.

                            ADAM
                       She couldn't have.  We can't
                       <u>make</u> them see us.

                            BARBARA
                       But she saw us.  I know.
                       I could feel it.  I thought
                       she saw me this morning, too.
                       (Beat)  How's your hand?

                            ADAM
                       Already healed.


     INT: BARN/GARAGE -- DAY

     The  Fine  Arts movers are going to it.   DELIA in the  midst  of
     everything, berating CATHY.

                            DELIA
                       Buckle down, Cathy.  This is
                       <u>Life.</u>  And be a perfect
                       darling, and go get mommy
                       some drugs.

                            CATHY
                       Any particular kind?

                            DELIA
                       It doesn't matter.  Just remember
                       though, too many is better than
                       too few.  And a glass of Perrier,
                       one cube.

     CATHY takes her marching orders and goes off towards the house.


     INT: UPSTAIRS HALLWAY -- DAY

     A BLAST OF STEAM --

     fills  the  hallway,  because WORKMEN are going at the  wallpaper
     here, too.  CATHY emerges from it.

     All  the  doors are open,  with MOVING MEN and WORKMEN  in  every
     room.

     Down at the end of the hall stands CHARLES, directing WORKMEN who
     are  carrying computer components into the room that will be  his
     study.

     CATHY starts to go into the bathroom -- to get her mother's drugs
     -- but there are at least three PLUMBERS in there,  and the whole
     place is torn apart.

     CATHY continues down the hall.

     CHARLES sees her.

                            CHARLES
                       Where is your sister?  She
                       could be a little help around
                       here.

                            CATHY
                       In her room?

     LYDIA's  door  is  the only one closed.   CHARLES goes  over  and
     without knocking, flings open the door.


     INT: LYDIA'S ROOM -- DAY

     On  LYDIA's  bed is a very muscular MOVING  MAN,   clad  only  in
     jockey  shorts.   LYDIA  is  moving quickly all around  the  bed,
     taking rapid-fire photographs of him.

                            CHARLES
                       Lydia, moving day is no time
                       to make one more attempt at
                       losing your virginity.

                            LYDIA
                       I have a concept for a moving
                       man calendar.

                            CHARLES
                       I want you and Cathy --

     As the MOVING MAN gets up from the bed, nonchalantly reaching for
     his trousers,  CHARLES looks around for CATHY.   She's no  longer
     there.

                            CHARLES (cont)
                       Now I've lost <u>her.</u>


     INT: STAIRCASE TO ATTIC -- DAY

     CATHY  creeps  upward,  taking the skeleton key from her  pocket.
     She stops momentarily when she hears her father's voice.

                            CHARLES (o.s.)
                       Cathy!  Cathy!

     Then  when that voice is covered by other sounds of  the  moving,
     CATHY continues upward.


     INT: ATTIC LANDING

     CATHY quietly inserts the key in the lock of the attic door.  She
     turns  it.   The key is stiff.   She turns harder.   It's  stuck.
     CATHY  tries  the door -- it's no go.   She turns the key  again.
     This  time it goes all the way around.   CATHY grins.   Then  she
     puts her hand on the knob and tries to turn it.  It's stuck.

     Then the key pops out of the lock and falls to the floor.

     CHARLES's head suddenly appears behind her.

                            CHARLES
                       What are you doing?


     INT: ATTIC

     ADAM  is holding on tight to the knob of the door.   With an  awl
     (or some similar object) BARBARA has poked the key out.  The  two
     stand  absolutely  still,  listening,  terrified  of  the  living
     intruders  -- pretty  unseemly behavior for a pair of  honest-to-
     goodness ghosts.


     INT: ATTIC LANDING

     CATHY and CHARLES.

                            CATHY
                       I was just trying to open the
                       door.  Mrs. Butterfield brought
                       over a skeleton key.  But it
                       doesn't work.

     She hands her father the key.  He waves it away.

                            CHARLES
                       Skeleton keys never work.
                       Now, hop to it, Cathy, your
                       mother wants her drugs.  And
                       we're all going to feel better
                       if she gets them.

     He starts down the stairs, and Cathy starts to follow.


     INT: ATTIC ROOM

     ADAM and BARBARA,  having heard this,  pull back from the door in
     relief.   But that relief is short-lived, for at that moment, the
     door swings open of its own accord.

     Right  outside  on the landing,  they see CATHY's back  as  she's
     starting down the stairs.

     CATHY turns at the sound of the opening door.

     ADAM and BARBARA disappear.

     REVERSE ANGLE --

     CATHY looks into the attic room, and sees the model town.

     She enters very quietly, looking around.

     The room is dim,  and filled with dust motes.   There are shadows
     in all the corners.

     The first thing she sees,  of course,  is the model town.   She's
     entranced.   She  peers  at  it from  different  angles,  and  is
     dumbfounded with pleasure,  her fear forgotten.  She continues to
     walk about the model, oblivious to everything else.

     IN THE MODEL --

     BARBARA  and  ADAM are hiding in the doorway of  their  appliance
     store  on  MAIN STREET.   They look up at CATHY's  enormous  face
     peering down at them.

     They see CATHY stop, her gaze focused on them.

     CATHY'S ENORMOUS HAND --

     reaches down out of the sky towards them.

                            ADAM
                       Barbara.  Stand very still.

     BACK TO SCENE --

     CATHY is reaching down into the model.   She picks up the BARBARA
     figure  out of the model.   BARBARA does her best imitation of  a
     wooden Indian.  CATHY peers at her very closely.

     BARBARA'S POV --

     A close-up of CATHY's eye.  She sees herself reflected.

     BACK TO SCENE --

     CATHY puts BARBARA down in the street,  and picks up ADAM.   ADAM
     has plastered a weird smile on his face.

     IN THE MODEL --

     BARBARA  stands  in the middle of the street,  pretending  to  be
     carved of wood, but she's looking up at CATHY holding ADAM.

                            BARBARA
                       (Under her breath)  Don't
                       hurt him, little girl.  Please
                       don't hurt my husband.

     CATHY  puts ADAM down in the street,  but not very near  BARBARA.
     He doesn't quite have his balance and tips over,  falling flat on
     his face.  CATHY conscientiously rights him.

     Despite  her fear of being overheard by CATHY,  BARBARA calls out
     in a hiss.

                            BARBARA
                       Are you all right?

                            ADAM
                       No.  Yes.

     BACK TO SCENE --

     CATHY continues around the model.  She finds a button on the side
     of  the  table on which the model rests,  and  presses  it.   The
     artificial sun comes on,  and bathes the model of Winter River in
     sunlight.  Then...

     A LOUD CRASH --

     behind  CATHY.   She  whirls around,  barely stifling  a  scream,
     confronting  only a push broom that she has brushed from its hook
     on the wall.

     In recovering from this false scare,  she kicks  something.   She
     ducks under the table and comes up with the manual.

     She holds the cover up to the light.

                            CATHY
                       "Handbook for the Recently
                       Deceased."

     She  looks  into  the  model again at the  figures  of  ADAM  and
     BARBARA.  They're now standing together.

                            CATHY
                       (Hums the 'Twilight Zone'
                       theme music)

     She looks around the room as if suddenly someone were going to be
     there to answer all her questions.  No one is.

     A voice sounds from downstairs.

                            LYDIA (v.o.)
                       Cathy, Delia needs you!

     CATHY gives one more look at the town,  and then goes to the door
     quickly and silently.

                            LYDIA (v.o.)
                       Right now!

     CATHY finds the real key to the room in the door,  on the inside.
     She takes it out of the lock.


     INT: ATTIC LANDING -- DAY

     CATHY  locks the door quickly,  tries the knob to make sure,  and
     hurries downstairs.


     INT: SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY -- DAY

     DELIA stands outside the master bedroom door,  arms  akimbo.   At
     her   feet  is  a  large  box  of  ADAM  and  BARBARA's  personal
     belongings.

                            DELIA
                       Where have you been?

                            CATHY
                       Nowhere.

     CHARLES comes out of his room, tossing out empty boxes.

                            CHARLES
                       Hiding out in the attic.
                       Did you get that door open?

                            CATHY
                       (Hesitating)  Skeleton keys
                       never work.

                            DELIA
                       Take this downstairs.  Dump
                       it.

     She kicks the box with ADAM and BARBARA's belongings.   DELIA and
     CHARLES disappear again.

     CATHY  lifts the box,  and starts downstairs with it.   Then  she
     stops dead still.

     At the top of the box is ADAM and BARBARA's wedding picture, with
     a swath of spray paint over it, obscuring their faces.

     CATHY puts down the box,  takes out the picture,  and removes the
     photograph from the frame.

     CU: BARBARA AND ADAM IN THE PHOTOGRAPH

                            CATHY
                       I knew it.

     She  slides the photograph under the door of her room,  and  then
     continues downstairs with the box.


     EXT: HOUSE -- NIGHT

     Dark, quiet, a light burning in the dining room window.


     INT: DINING ROOM -- NIGHT

     The DEETZs around the dining room table.  There are candles, good
     china  laid  out  -- but they're eating out of  Chinese  take-out
     boxes.

     CHARLES, DELIA, and LYDIA are eating with chopsticks, while CATHY
     uses a plain old American fork.

                            LYDIA
                       I can't believe that we're
                       eating Cantonese.

                            CHARLES
                       There's only one Chinese
                       restaurant in town, darling,
                       and it happens to be Cantonese.

                            LYDIA
                       I could have a stroke from the
                       amount of MSG that's in this
                       food.

                            DELIA
                       This is our first meal in this
                       house, Lydia.  Why don't we all
                       do our little parts to make it
                       a pleasant one?

                            CHARLES
                       I'm building you a darkroom in
                       the basement.  Nobody's ever
                       going to steal your chemicals
                       again.  That'll be a pleasant
                       change from Manhattan.

                            LYDIA
                       I should have stayed in New York
                       with my mother.  Just driving
                       through Winter River made me want
                       to slit my throat.

                            CHARLES
                       We're the first trickle.  In a
                       couple of years this whole town
                       will be filled with people like
                       us.  Zabar's will open a Winter
                       River branch.

                            DELIA
                       And when Otho and I get through
                       with this house, you people are
                       not going to recognize it as the
                       same place.

                            CATHY
                       (Meekly)  I sort of like it the
                       way it is.

     The family stares at her, unbelieving.

                            CATHY (cont)
                       I mean, it's already sort of like
                       somebody's home, isn't it?

     There  is a pause,  as if the family were considering this  whole
     business in a new light.  Then the moment and the light fade.

                            CHARLES
                       You know, I went in the grocery
                       store today, and they had never
                       even heard of arugula.


     INT: ATTIC -- NIGHT

     ADAM and BARBARA are pissed.

     ADAM  is looking through the manual,  while BARBARA paces looking
     over his shoulder now and then.

                            BARBARA
                       Ghosts have been scaring people
                       for thousands of years.  It
                       must say something about haunting.

                            ADAM
                       That electricity hurt.  I don't
                       want to have to think about that
                       kind of thing happening to you.

                            BARBARA
                       I think I'd rather have a
                       band of gypsies move in here
                       than have to put up with those
                       people.  And we don't even know
                       how long we're supposed to stay
                       here?  I wish that book would tell
                       us something useful.

     A GUST OF WIND --

     blows down the chimney, turning the pages of the manual.

     BARBARA and ADAM shiver with sudden, supernatural cold.

     ADAM looks at the book.

                            ADAM
                       (Reading)  Section Seventeen-C.
                       Intercessions and Exorcisms.

                            BARBARA
                       Exorcism.  That's where they
                       get rid of us, right?

                            ADAM
                       Not this kind.  This is where
                       we get rid of them.

                            BARBARA
                       What do we have to do?

                            ADAM
                       It won't work.  We need a
                       graveyard.

                            BARBARA
                       And we can't leave the house.

     The MOON over the model town comes on suddenly.

     ADAM  and BARBARA's gaze follows the directed beams of this moon,
     as it shines down into the MODEL GRAVEYARD.


     EXT: MODEL GRAVEYARD -- NIGHT

     With  shovels and lanterns,  BARBARA and ADAM are a very unlikely
     pair of graverobbers.  ADAM is reading the manual by lanternlight.

     The mechanized clouds in the sky move across the mechanical moon,
     throwing shadows everywhere.  There is also ground fog.

                            ADAM
                       The manual says look for a
                       grave marked Swallowtail.

                            BARBARA
                       Nobody with that name
                       was ever buried in this
                       town.

     They pass a small mouldering tomnbstone,  askew,  half-buried  in
     the ground, the mound before it covered with rotting white roses.
     On the tomb is carved the name BETELGEUSE.

                            ADAM
                       Yeah, but nobody was
                       ever buried with that
                       name either.

     He tries to pronounce the name, but it comes out something like

                            ADAM (cont)
                       Bettle - gooser.

     On  a  wind  suddenly  blowing  through the  trees  we  hear  the
     ominously whispered pronunciation:

                            VOICE
                       Beetle Juice.

                            BARBARA
                       Beetle Juice.

     Moving on,  looking around other parts of the graveyard, ADAM and
     BARBARA  next come to a large,  white marble monument crowned  by
     the  Angel Gabriel blowing his horn.   Carved on the monument  is
     the  name SWALLOWTAIL.   Beneath it is the legend,  HOPE FOR  THE
     HOPELESS.

                            BARBARA
                       Do we dig?

                            ADAM
                       Well, yes, but it says
                       we have to chant too.

                            BARBARA
                       Chant what?

     He turns the page in the book.

                            ADAM
                       I don't think it says.
                       Some sort of music I
                       guess.

                            BARBARA
                       That stupid book.  All
                       right.  But you start.

     They stand over the grave, with spades poised.  ADAM thinks for a
     moment and then,  as he turns the first spadeful of foetid earth,
     he sings

                            ADAM
                       "I've got rhythm...
                       I've got music..."

     BARBARA takes it up:

                            BARBARA
                       "I've got my man..."

                            ADAM & BARBARA
                       "Who could ask for anything more..."

                                                          DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT: MODEL GRAVEYARD -- NIGHT

     Sometime later.   The grave is now nearly six feet deep, and ADAM
     and  BARBARA are invisible inside.   We see the glint of the moon
     on their shovel blades,  and we hear them singing.   By this time
     ADAM  and  BARBARA  have  really  gotten  into  it,  and  they're
     performing a rousing,  syncopated version of "I've Got Rhythm" as
     the earth flies.

     -- INSIDE THE GRAVE

     ADAM suddenly hits wood.

                            BARBARA
                       It's about time.

     They  lean  down  and  brush dirt off the  face  of  the  coffin.
     There's a brass plate that reads SWALLOWTAIL.

                            ADAM
                       I guess we open it.
                       Right?

     BARBARA and ADAM feel a slight tremor beneath their feet.

                            BARBARA
                       It seems to be opening
                       itself.

     BARBARA  and  ADAM exchange glances,  and then start clawing  the
     sides of the grave in an effort to escape.

     -- BACK ON GROUND LEVEL

     ADAM  pushes BARBARA out,  as the ground rumbles and we hear  the
     splintering of rotten wood.  BARBARA helps ADAM out of the grave.

     They  have  just risen to their feet,  when a  MOULDERING  CORPSE
     springs  out of the grave,  and jumps onto  BARBARA's  back,  and
     tries to implant a very large kiss on her lips.

     ADAM  pulls  the corpse off BARBARA's back,  and  the  MOULDERING
     CORPSE does a Three Stooges hammer to Adam's head.

     ADAM staggers backwards.  The MOULDERING CORPSE, now between ADAM
     and  BARBARA,  grins insanely at them both,  and then flies  high
     into the air above their heads.

     They  turn  to  see  where he has  gone,  and  realize  that  the
     MOULDERING  CORPSE  is merely a jack-in-the-box marionette  on  a
     string and pole apparatus.

     The  pole is held by BEETLE JUICE.   He is small and wiry,  dark,
     with vaguely Middle-Eastern features.   Here, and whenever we see
     him  again  at the beginning of a scene,  his eyes are  COLD  and
     YELLOW  and  SHAPED LIKE A SNAKE'S -- but after  a  moment,  they
     melt,  becoming human, and liquid, and brown.  This is definitely
     not a spirit to be trusted.

     BEETLE JUICE drops the pole and puppet, takes a long step forward
     and produces a deck of cards.

                            BEETLE JUICE
                       Never mind him.  Pick a
                       card.

     Stunned, BARBARA and ADAM do as they're told.

     ADAM holds up his card.  It's the tarot card for death.

                            BEETLE JUICE
                       Death.

     BARBARA  holds up her card.   It's the tarot card of the  Falling
     Tower.

                            BEETLE JUICE
                       Destruction.

     BARBARA glances up at the statue of the Angel Gabriel.

                            BARBARA
                       Are you Swallowtail?

                            BEETLE JUICE
                       He's all tied up.  I'm
                       his second-in-command.
                       The name is Beetle Juice.
                       Come on.  Let's talk.

     He  gives an arm to BARBARA and ADAM,  and leads them out of  the
     graveyard.

     As they depart,  we see the figure of SWALLOWTAIL -- exactly like
     the statue of Angel Gabriel -- bound and gagged and out of  sight
     behind  his monument.   He stares after the retreating figures of
     BARBARA  and  ADAM with pity -- he's got a pretty  good  idea  of
     what's coming.


     EXT: MODEL TOWN MAIN STREET -- NIGHT

     BEETLE JUICE has an arm around the shoulders of ADAM and BARBARA.

     Main Street is quiet and deserted, of course.

                            BEETLE JUICE
                       All right, you guys need
                       help.  And help is why I'm
                       here.  Who do I gotta kill?

                            ADAM
                       You don't kill <u>any</u>body.

                            BARBARA
                       All we want is for you to
                       get some people out of our
                       house.

                            BEETLE JUICE
                       Exorcism, right.  I <u>love</u>
                       exorcisms.  So who are these
                       people you want to get rid of?

                            BARBARA
                       The Deetzes.

                            BEETLE JUICE
                       Family, right?  Mommie,
                       daddy, they got kids?

                            ADAM
                       Two daughters.  One's
                       about ten, one's about
                       sixteen, except she acts
                       like she's thirty-five.

                            BEETLE JUICE
                       Oh yeah?  How does
                       she feel about short, older
                       men?

     BARBARA gives BEETLE JUICE the fish eye.

                            BARBARA
                       I don't appreciate that kind
                       of talk.

                            BEETLE JUICE
                       Idle curiosity.  So here's
                       the story.  You're dead, and
                       you're stuck in this dump
                       for a hundred and thirty-
                       two years --

                            BARBARA
                       That's how long we're
                       going to be here?  How do
                       you know?

                            BEETLE JUICE
                       How do I know, guys?  It's
                       my business to know.  Anyway,
                       so you're stuck in this dump
                       ...

                            ADAM
                       It's not a dump.

                            BEETLE JUICE
                       ... and you want it all to
                       yourselves.  And even though
                       these live guys have paid their
                       hard earned money for the home
                       of the dreams, you dead guys
                       are gonna drive 'em out in
                       the cold, mommy, daddy, and
                       two little girls, one of whom
                       probably wouldn't say no to
                       a shorter, older man.

                            BARBARA
                       The Deetzes are destroying
                       our house.

                            BEETLE JUICE
                       Right.  And I'm here to help
                       you.

     The trio pass the appliance store.   The large plate glass window
     bears the legend:  GENERAL APPLIANCES / ADAM AND BARBARA MAITLAND
     / EST. 1963.  BEETLE JUICE points at the window.

                            BEETLE JUICE
                       You.  The Maitlands.  'Cause
                       people like you are the backbone
                       of the afterlife.  Just because
                       you're dead doesn't mean that
                       you can't still hold onto the
                       things that were important to
                       you when you were alive.

     BARBARA  and ADAM are evidently a little uncomfortable with  this
     selfish interpretation of their actions.

                            BEETLE JUICE (cont)
                       So, basically what we got
                       here is a third-class inter-
                       session.  Nothing big, and
                       if it's works we're all
                       happy.  I'm gonna teach you
                       guys a few tricks.  And we're
                       gonna start out with something
                       simple.

                            ADAM
                       You've handled problems like this
                       before, haven't you?

     Behind  them,  the  window of the appliance store suddenly  crack
     into a spider's web pattern,  completely obliterating BARBARA and
     ADAM's names.   Hearing the noise, BARBARA and ADAM start to turn
     their heads, but BEETLE JUICE prods them forward.

                            BEETLE JUICE
                       You ever hear of a place called
                       Amityville?


     INT: MASTER BEDROOM -- NIGHT

     DELIA reading in bed,  and watching television,  and eating.  She
     hears a noise outside in the corridor,  listens for a moment  and
     then gets up to investigate.


     INT: UPSTAIRS HALLWAY -- NIGHT

     Empty, but a closet door is open.

     DELIA  goes  down to investigate.   She finds in the  open  linen
     closet  that one of the drawers is open,  and a pile of her  best
     designer sheets has been dropped on the floor.

                            DELIA
                       Damn those girls.

     She picks the sheets back up,  puts them in the drawer, and shits
     the linen closet door.

     She returns to her bedroom.

     When  she  disappears,  the linen closet door swings slowly  open
     again.  BARBARA and ADAM come out holding sheets.

                            BARBARA
                       I might have known a woman
                       like that wouldn't have a
                       single pair of plain white
                       sheets.

                            ADAM
                       I don't think this is going
                       to work.


     INT: CHARLES'S STUDY -- NIGHT

     This  is  the first room to have been totally set up,  with  four
     different word processors.  Above each computer are framed covers
     of paperback books that Charles has written: thrillers, detective
     novels, romances, and westerns.

     CHARLES is working with two printers at once,  and the pages  are
     just spilling out.   CHARLES is also working a Xerox machine, and
     talking on the telephone -- all at the same time.

                            CHARLES
                       No, Evelyn, ten per cent
                       on the first hundred K, and
                       twelve thereafter.  No more
                       of this --

     He  hears  something  in the corridor outside -- a  kind  of  low
     moaning.

                            CHARLES
                       Just a minute, Evelyn.
                       Somebody --

     He goes to the door and flings it open.

     Two  figures  are  right there in  the  doorway  -- ghosts  under
     sheets.  But they're designer sheets.

                            CHARLES
                       Oh Jesus, you two.  Is
                       Connecticut so boring that
                       you have to think up shit like
                       this?  I've got a book due at
                       Dell tomorrow morning, and I'll
                       get a bonus if it's there on
                       time -- and you want to make
                       me miss that bonus?

     He slams the door,  turns around.   Then turns around again,  and
     jerks the door open.  The ghosts are startled.

                            CHARLES
                       And Delia is going to kill you
                       when she sees that you cut holes
                       in her Ralph Lauren sheets.

     He slams the door again.


     INT: UPSTAIRS HALLWAY -- NIGHT

     ADAM and BARBARA as ghosts under the sheets.

                            BARBARA
                       Don't you think he could
                       have come up with something
                       a little more -- I don't
                       know -- scary?

                            ADAM
                       Well, he said we'd have
                       to start slow.

     At  this moment,  they are startled when the door of LYDIA's room
     flies  open.   LYDIA  jumps  out  and takes  a  whole  series  of
     photographs of them, one after the other.

                            LYDIA
                       Sick!  Sexual perversion!  You
                       guys never did this kind of thing
                       in New York.  Total gross-out.
                       If you're going to do weird
                       sexual stuff you ought to stay
                       in your bedroom, okay?  It's
                       so embarrassing.

     LYDIA flies back into her room.

                            ADAM
                       (Discouraged)  Keep it trying?

                            BARBARA
                       Might as well.

     They open the door of the master bedroom and glide inside.


     INT: MASTER BEDROOM -- NIGHT

     Television still going,  DELIA asleep.   ADAM and BARBARA go over
     and stand beside the bed.

                            ADAM
                       He said to moan.

     Tentatively, they MOAN and GROAN.  DELIA doesn't stir.

                            BARBARA
                       I feel really stupid.

                            ADAM
                       I know.  But we're ghosts.  And
                       ghosts are supposed to moan.
                       Moan louder.

     They MOAN LOUDER, and more weirdly.

     DELIA  stirs,  reaches over to the bedside table for  the  remote
     control  device,  and  without opening her eyes,  turns  off  the
     television set.  Then she turns over, and is lost to the world.

     BARBARA sighs.   She and ADAM walk towards the door.   When  they
     open  it  however,  CATHY is standing there -- and both ADAM  and
     BARBARA jump backwards with yelps of fright.

                            CATHY
                       Are you the guys who're hiding
                       out in the attic?

                            ADAM
                       (Faked voice of terror)  We're
                       ghosts.

                            BARBARA
                       (Moans weirdly)

                            CATHY
                       What do you look like under
                       there?

     ADAM  and  BARBARA  go out into the hall -- as  if  to  keep  from
     waking DELIA with their conversation.


     INT: UPSTAIRS HALLWAY -- NIGHT

     ADAM, BARBARA, and CATHY.

                            ADAM
                       Aren't you scared?

                            CATHY
                       Those are <u>sheets.</u>  I'm not
                       afraid of sheets.  Are you gross
                       under there?  Are you "Night of
                       the Living Dead" under there?

                            ADAM
                       What?

                            CATHY
                       It's this gross movie.

                            BARBARA
                       Young lady, if I had seen a ghost
                       at your age, I'd have been
                       frightened out of my wits.  I'd
                       suggest you go to your room and
                       think about that.  Come on, Adam.

     BARBARA  and ADAM continue down the hall with as much dignity  as
     they  can  muster under the circumstances.   CATHY  trails  along
     behind  them,  then steps on the dragging tails of their  sheets.
     The sheets slip off,  exposing BARBARA and ADAM -- looking pretty
     silly in their underwear.

                            CATHY
                       You're not gross.  Why were you
                       wearing the sheets?

     BARBARA and ADAM whirl around.

                            BARBARA
                       That's what we were told to do.

                            ADAM
                       You can actually see us?  Even
                       without the sheets?

     Then  ADAM  and BARBARA realize that they are standing  in  their
     underwear and grab the sheets to recover their modesty.

                            CATHY
                       Is this like a trick question?

                            ADAM
                       No, it's not a trick question.
                       Can you really see us?

                            BARBARA
                       Tell the truth.

                            CATHY
                       I always tell the truth, even
                       when it hurts and gets me in
                       trouble and people don't want
                       to hear it.  Of course I can
                       see you.

                            BARBARA
                       Nobody else can.

                            CATHY
                       (Shrugging)  Were you trying to
                       scare my mom or something?

                            BARBARA
                       Something like that.

                            CATHY
                       It won't work.  She's sleeping
                       with Prince Valium tonight.  I
                       stole the key to the attic, you
                       know.


     INT: ATTIC ROOM -- NIGHT

     The mechanical moon makes its slow track through the heavens.

     Moonlit, serene.

     BACK TO SCENE --

     ADAM,  BARBARA,  and  CATHY stand just beyond the fringes of  the
     town, dimly lighted giants.

                            CATHY
                       Where are the little figures
                       I saw in there yesterday?

                            ADAM
                       That was us.

                            CATHY
                       Really?  How'd you make your-
                       selves shrink?

                            BARBARA
                       It just happened.  Sometimes
                       we have control, but most of
                       the time --

     CATHY nods.  Life is like that.

                            CATHY
                       (To ADAM)  You did this?  You
                       carved all these little houses
                       and things?

                            ADAM
                       (Pleased)  I certainly did.

                            CATHY
                       And this used to be your house,
                       I bet.

                            BARBARA
                       I don't think it would be a
                       very good idea if you told your
                       parents or your sister that
                       we're up here.

                            ADAM
                       Unless you think we could scare
                       them.

                            CATHY
                       Why do you want to scare
                       everybody?

                            ADAM
                       We want to frighten you away.
                       So that you'll move out.

                            CATHY
                       You don't know my family very
                       well, do you?  (Beat)  I like
                       it up here.  Can I visit you
                       sometimes?









     -----------------------------------------------------------------


     EXT: HOUSE -- DAY

     Like all the other shots,  but there's a quality of waiting about
     it.  Full sun.


     EXT: SIDE OF HOUSE -- DAY

     Shaded by a tree.


     EXT: BASEMENT WINDOW -- DAY

     Heavily in shadow.


     INT: BASEMENT -- DAY

     Shadowed,  potentially filled with terror as are all basements in
     horror  movies.   CAMERA moves over to a little shed-like room in
     the corner.  Noise of a FAST-MOVING CLOCK.


     INT: UPSTAIRS BATHROOM -- DAY

     DELIA shrieks.   Going through the dirty clothes, she's just come
     across the sheets with the eye-holes cut in them.

                            DELIA
                       Lydia!  Cathy!  Cathy!


     INT: DARKROOM -- DAY

     A  photograph coming up in the developing tank -- the  ghosts  in
     the hallway.

                            LYDIA
                       Oh my God...  oh shit...
                       No feet...


     INT: DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY -- DAY

     LYDIA, pounding up from the basement with the wet print, collides
     with DELIA, rushing down from the second floor with the scissored
     sheets.

                            LYDIA
                       Oh God, Delia.  They were
                       ghosts!  Ghosts!  They didn't
                       have any feet!

                            DELIA
                       Lydia, I'm going to kill you,
                       honest to God I'm going to kill
                       you.  I'm going to lock you in
                       that basement like you were a
                       goddamned hyacinth.

     LYDIA  stands open-mouthed with the wet photograph.   DELIA turns
     on her heel and storms up the stairs.

                            DELIA (cont)
                       Cathy!  Cathy!  I'm going to
                       kill you too.


     INT: CHARLES'S OFFICE -- DAY

     Later in the day.   LYDIA has calmed down,  changed clothes.  She
     now  has a number of the prints.   CATHY's there too,  looking at
     the  prints,  saying nothing,  and certainly not giving away  the
     fact that she talked to the ghosts.

     CHARLES  is seated before the word processor,  vainly  trying  to
     work.

                            LYDIA
                       Can you believe it?  I mean,
                       this is the weirdest --

                            CHARLES
                       Lydia, I don't know what it
                       is with you and these practical
                       jokes, but --

                            LYDIA
                       THIS IS NOT A JOKE!

                            CHARLES
                       This is air-brushing.  This is
                       a result of that class you took
                       in air-brushing last fall.  It's
                       pretty good, but I've seen better.
                       Now would you two please --

     The door of the room flies open, and there stands DELIA, carrying
     several sets of sheets.

                            DELIA
                       I want you two girls to know
                       that there is no Ralph Lauren
                       outlet in Winter River.  Which
                       means that Otho and Evelyn
                       -- our very first overnight
                       guests in this house -- are going
                       to be sleeping tonight on a
                       polyester blend.

     She flings the sheets at LYDIA and CATHY.

                            LYDIA
                       Delia, look at these pictures.
                       Please.  Just for a minute.
                       Honest.  There are ghosts in
                       this house.

                            CATHY
                       There are.  I've seen them.

     The family stare at her for a minute.

                            CATHY (cont)
                       I talked to them.  They're
                       very nice.  (Beat)  Their names
                       are Adam and Barbara, and they
                       live --

     In the midst of this, DELIA explodes.

                            DELIA
                       I can't believe you two are doing
                       this to me!  Ghosts.  <u>Ghosts.</u>
                       Otho and Evelyn will be here in
                       half an hour and I haven't even
                       <u>begun</u> to salt the ducks and
                       you are coming to me with this
                       bullshit about ghosts!  I can't
                       believe that you two are trying to
                       undermine my self-esteem in this
                       way.

     She storms out of the room.

     CHARLES looks at his two daughters.

                            CHARLES
                       Great.  Fabulous.  It's going to
                       be a terrific evening.  I can tell
                       already.

     He goes out, after DELIA.

     CATHY is left alone with LYDIA.   LYDIA flings the photographs at
     CATHY.

                            LYDIA
                       You jerk.  That would have believed
                       me if you hadn't thrown in all that
                       other crap.  They'll never listen
                       to me now.

     LYDIA storms out.

                            CATHY
                       But it's true.  They're...

     She's all alone in the office.

     One  of  the printers sputters to life,  and begins to  spew  out
     pages.

     CATHY  slowly  walks  out of the room,  looking  through  LYDIA's
     photographs.


     INT: THE ATTIC -- DAY

     ADAM and BARBARA are looking at the photographs.

                            CATHY
                       Those are the pictures my
                       sister took, and even when
                       she showed them to Mom and
                       Dad, they didn't believe
                       you were real.  And then I
                       said I had met you, and they
                       still didn't believe us.

                            ADAM
                       Well, we'll have to try
                       something else.  Maybe if
                       you came back a little later,
                       we could work something up.
                       Sort of try it out on you
                       first.

                            CATHY
                       I don't know if I can come
                       back tonight.  We're having
                       guests -- Lydia's real mom,
                       and Otho -- he's the one who's
                       helping Mom do all the re-
                       decoration.  And Mom says I
                       have to macerate the endive.

     CATHY leaves.

                            BEETLE JUICE (v.o.)
                       Poor kid.

     ADAM and BARBARA look down into the model.

     IN THE MODEL --

     BEETLE JUICE lies sunning himself in the park.   He's wearing the
     world's  smallest Speedo,  and has a sunning reflector around his
     neck.

                            BARBARA
                       Those sheets didn't work at
                       all.

                            BEETLE JUICE
                       I told you.  You have to start
                       small till you get the hang of
                       it.  Hey', they're giving a
                       party tonight, and there's
                       your chance.

                            ADAM
                       You'll tell us what to do?

                            BEETLE JUICE
                       That's what I'm here for,
                       pal.  Hey, you're blocking
                       my rays.

     ADAM and BARBARA pull back.


     INT: DINING ROOM -- NIGHT

     The  DEETZ's  first dinner party,  using EVELYN (CHARLES's  first
     wife,) and OTHO as guinea pigs.   Even so, things aren't going as
     well as DELIA had hoped.  It's EVELYN who's putting in the knife,
     and OTHO (under the guise of friendship) who's twisting it.

                            EVELYN
                       <u>Nobody</u> understands why
                       you did it, Delia.

                            CATHY
                       Did what?

                            EVELYN
                       Drag your whole family into
                       the wilds of Connecticut.
                       You'll never get anybody
                       to visit you.

                            CHARLES
                       You came quickly enough,
                       Evelyn.

                            EVELYN
                       That's because I had to get
                       you to sign some very important
                       contracts.  People come up to
                       me, and say, "Why on earth did
                       they do it?  What's in Winter
                       River?"

                            LYDIA
                       Zilch.  Zilch is what is in
                       Winter River.

                            OTHO
                       Well, I defend you.  I tell
                       people that I think it was
                       a wonderful idea.  Charles can
                       write without distraction --
                       and for a conceptual artist like
                       Delia who is -- let's face it,
                       in a critical slump... I tell
                       people it's good for you to
                       appear inaccessible.  But I have
                       to agree with Evelyn, it's going
                       to be hard to get people out here.

     DELIA, in her agitation, knocks over a glass of water.  The glass
     falls  off  the table onto the fine Oriental carpet  beneath  the
     table.  There's a little distracting to-do about retrieving it.

                            DELIA
                       Well, there's not going to be
                       any difficulty about getting them
                       out here when they find out just
                       how special this house is.

                            OTHO
                       It's nice, Delia, and it will be
                       more than presentable when I've
                       worked my way with it -- but I
                       don't know if I'd care to use the
                       word <u>special.</u>

                            DELIA
                       Ghosts aren't special?  Ghosts
                       are pretty special in my book.

                            CHARLES
                       (Cautionary)  Lydia and Cathy
                       tried to play a little joke on
                       us this afternoon.

                            LYDIA
                       It wasn't a joke.

                            CHARLES
                       They tried to convince Delia
                       and me that this house was
                       haunted.

     OTHO's glance is sharp at this.

                            DELIA
                       Of course I was a little
                       sceptical at first, but I've
                       always felt I had a sympathy
                       with that sort of thing.
                       And Otho, ghosts should be
                       right up your alley.

                            LYDIA
                       Why?

                            DELIA
                       Before Otho started
                       slinging chintz he was
                       giving backroom seances
                       in the East Village.

                            OTHO
                       Yes, well, the bottom fell
                       out of the psychic market
                       in seventy-two, but my powers
                       are undiminished.  And I have
                       never relinquished my profound
                       interest in matters of the 
                       spirit.

                            EVELYN
                       Delia, it's cute schtick, but
                       you're going to have a pretty
                       rough time convincing
                       me -- or any of your other
                       friends -- that this house is
                       haunted.  We're going to need
                       -- what's that phrase?

                            OTHO
                       Ocular demonstration.

                            EVELYN
                       Right.  Proof.  We just --

     EVELYN suddenly breaks off with --

     A VIOLENT SCREAM.

     DELIA  stares  at her for a moment,  then an expression of  shock
     crosses DELIA's face and she shrieks as well.

     The two women try to push back their chairs from the  table,  but
     can't.

     The patterned flowers and vines in the carpet have begun to grow,
     twisting around the chair- and table-legs.

     New shoots and vines appear,  unfold, and twist even as we watch.
     The flowers bud and bloom, as in a Disney time-lapse nature film.

     Everyone  looks  on  with  astonishment as  more  of  the  carpet
     sprouts.  There is a general retreat from the table.

     LYDIA fetches one of her cameras, never very far away.

                            LYDIA
                       It's the ghosts.  I told you.
                       I told you they were real.

                            CHARLES
                       Then Cathy was telling the
                       truth too.  (To OTHO)  She
                       said she had talked to them.

                            OTHO
                       It's woooon-der-fullll.  In-
                       controvertible proof of the presence
                       of the supernatural element in this
                       house.  I was, and I remain, an
                       expert in this field.

     DELIA shoots a look of triumph at EVELYN.


     INT: ATTIC ROOM -- NIGHT

     ADAM  and  BARBARA lying on the floor with their heads  near  the
     window, looking out over the front yard.

                            ADAM
                       Any minute now.  They'll all
                       run screaming --

     Timid knock at the door of the attic.

     BARBARA  glances at ADAM and then goes to the door and opens  it.
     CATHY is standing there, sheepish.

                            CATHY
                       They'd like for you to come
                       downstairs.  Mom says you
                       can use any sheets you want.


     INT: LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

     The  DEETZs,  OTHO,  and  EVELYN are  sitting  expectantly.   The
     photographs are being passed around.

                            DELIA
                       I mean, doesn't it indicate a
                       marvellous sense of humor on the
                       part of the ghosts that they
                       actually do appear in sheets?
                       Who would expect <u>that</u>?

                            OTHO
                       We are obviously dealing with
                       a very sophisticated pair.

                            EVELYN
                       Charles, I want to know why
                       you didn't call me about this
                       right away.  The book rights
                       alone could make us a fortune...

     She waves a hand toward the dining room.   It's a total jungle in
     there now.

                            CHARLES
                       We were just waiting for proof,
                       Evelyn.

     He points to LYDIA's photographs.

                            EVELYN
                       Yes, of course.  Lydia
                       darling, these prints alone --

     CATHY appears at the base of the stairs.   Everyone looks to  her
     expectantly.

                            CATHY
                       They just won't.  They wouldn't
                       say why.

                            DELIA
                       Well they have to.  That's all
                       there is to it.

                            OTHO
                       They must have a reason.

                            CATHY
                       I think the reason is they were
                       trying to scare you, and you
                       didn't get scared --

                            DELIA
                       Of course we weren't scared.
                       Just a little startled.

                            CHARLES
                       I don't see --

     He  breaks  off  when he looks back at  the  dining  room.   It's
     completely  clear again.  All eyes travel to that room.

                            EVELYN
                       Of course they were rather
                       spectacular effects -- for
                       Connecticut I mean.

                            DELIA
                       Are you insinuating --

                            OTHO
                       (To CATHY)  You can see them,
                       can't you?

     CATHY doesn't answer.

                            CHARLES
                       Where do they live?  Hide out?

                            OTHO
                       All presences have a home
                       space.  A place where they
                       work out of, so to speak.

                            CATHY
                       The attic.

                            DELIA
                       (To CATHY)  Well then, come
                       on.


     INT: LANDING OUTSIDE OF ATTIC

     CATHY AND DELIA

                            DELIA
                       They're in there?  This is
                       where they've been hiding
                       out?

     CATHY nods.  DELIA pounds on the door.

                            DELIA
                       All right, you dead people,
                       come on out, or we're going
                       to break down this goddamn
                       door and drag you downstairs.

                            CATHY
                       Why don't you say please?

                            DELIA
                       You've got to take the
                       right tone in things like this,
                       Cathy, or people -- whether
                       they're dead or alive -- people
                       will walk all over you.  These
                       are lessons that it's important
                       for you to learn.  (Loud)  Come
                       on you, or I will make death
                       so miserable for you that you
                       will wish you had never been
                       buried.

     The door cracks open with an EERIE WHINE.


     INT: LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

     The family waiting,  expectant.  DELIA comes down the stairs with
     a smug smile.  CATHY follows, looking worried.

                            CHARLES
                       Are they coming?

                            OTHO
                       They're already here.  I can
                       feel it.

                            EVELYN
                       (Sceptical)
                       How do we know?

     She looks at CHARLES, as if to say, DELIA's Trying To Pull a Fast
     One.

     Then, quite suddenly, these things happen:
       An ugly modern lamp is knocked over and smashed.
       An enormous rip appears in a dreadful canvas on the wall.
       The ugly rug in the center of the room has a pentangle charred
         into it.
       All  the  chairs  are knocked  over  backwards,  with  everyone
         spilling out.

     There's  a  moment of stunned silence,  and then the  DEETZs  and
     their  two  guests -- without saying a word -- get up  and  begin
     politely to applaud.


     INT: MODEL WHOREHOUSE -- NIGHT

     Old-fashioned, turn-of-the-century, parody of Storyville.  BEETLE
     JUICE  is  surrounded with horned lovelies,  drinking  champagne,
     carousing.  The song "Honky Tonk Angel" is playing on a piano.


     INT: ATTIC -- NIGHT

     BARBARA and ADAM, in high dudgeon, are staring down at the model.
     The whorehouse is garishly lighted -- and we hear the music  only
     faintly.

                            ADAM
                       I did <u>not</u> build a
                       cathouse for Winter River.

     He reaches down and lifts off the roof of the cathouse.


     INT: MODEL WHOREHOUSE -- NIGHT

     The  roof  comes off.   The horned lovelies scatter  with  little
     squeals of fright.

                            BEETLE JUICE
                       You went to a party.
                       Thought I'd have a little
                       party of my own.  How'd it
                       go, guys?

                            BARBARA
                       It went great.  Now it looks
                       like we're going to spend the
                       next hundred and thirty-two
                       years doing parlor tricks.

                            ADAM
                       It didn't scare them a bit.
                       They applauded.  Are you going
                       to be able to give us some
                       <u>real</u> help?

                            BEETLE JUICE
                       Yeah.  Sure.  So you're asking
                       me to really help you?

                            BARBARA & ADAM
                       Yes, we are.

                            BEETLE JUICE
                       Then I'll put my thinking cap
                       on.  And you two guys don't
                       have to worry about anything
                       anymore.

     ADAM replaces the roof, and it shakes the whole house.

     BEETLE  JUICE  sits  alone  in  the  whorehouse  parlor,  sipping
     champagne.   He has a wry smile on his face.  Everything is going
     according to plan.









     -----------------------------------------------------------------


     INT: WINTER RIVER HIGH SCHOOL CAFETERIA -- NOON

     We  open  on a large banner reading:  WELCOME BACK  WINTER  RIVER
     BADGERS

     We  pan off the banner to three hundred stunned-looking  Badgers,
     the   freshest-faced  crop  of  wholesome  American  teens   ever
     assembled in one cafeteria.

     They all stare dumbfounded at...

     LYDIA DEETZ

     sitting  all alone in full DEATH ROCKER regalia.   She wears a T-
     shirt  emblazoned with a holographic image of  the  CHEST-BURSTER
     from  ALIEN;  a  skirt  that appears to be made of  barbed  wire;
     Nefertiti eye make-up;  earrings that are dangling mouse  skulls.
     Completing  the  ensemble is a pair of high-heeled boots  with  a
     hobble bar attached.

     Sitting  in front of her is a single half-pint container of white
     milk.

     From  the opposite side of the room,  an intrepid  female  BADGER
     gets  up  and  crosses to LYDIA.   She's blonde  and  sweet,  and
     obviously drew the short straw.

     LYDIA eyes her approach darkly.

     The BADGER reaches LYDIA's table.

                            BADGER
                       Cheerleader tryouts are
                       Saturday.

                            LYDIA
                       Great.  I'll be in New
                       York.


     EXT: HOUSE -- DAY

     It  actually looks good -- at least from the outside.   Calm  and
     sedate.

     It  even  seems  to turn Norman Rockwell-time when a  big  yellow
     schoolbus arrives and deposits CATHY on the front lawn.

     The  entire  busful of children lean out of the windows  to  wave
     frantically at CATHY -- she was evidently a hit at school.   When
     the  bus takes off,  CATHY goes up the front steps of her  house,
     and in at the front door.


     INT: FOYER AND LIVING ROOM -- DAY

     OTHO's  worked  his  magic,  and the house is  exactly  as  DELIA
     probably  wanted it.   Fashionable in the extremity of the  term,
     angling   for  a  spread  in  <u>Architectural   Digest</u>.    Garish,
     uncomfortable,  expensive, not meant in any serious way for human
     habitation.

                            CATHY
                       Hi mom.

                            DELIA
                       I'm four minutes off.

     DELIA  is in the corner of the living room,  working on her water
     clock.   This is a tall,  enormous,  narrow sculpture -- reaching
     floor  to ceiling,  and then stretching up through a hole  carved
     through to the next floor.  It's a mass of small buckets, dishes,
     drains,  pipes,  levers,  and counter-weights with running  water
     keeping  the  whole thing in tremulous motion.   It somehow  also
     manages to keep the time on a little dial that's set on a kind of
     eye-stalk protruding into the room.

     BACK TO SCENE --

     DELIA is making fine-tuning adjustments.

                            CATHY
                       I'm going upstairs to do
                       homework, Mom.

                            DELIA
                       I know where you're going,
                       you're going up to the attic.

                            CATHY
                       Just for a little while.

                            DELIA
                       They know about the thirtieth.

                            CATHY
                       I told them.

                            DELIA
                       This housewarming party is
                       very important to your father
                       and me.  And they had better
                       come across.  They're not
                       getting a free ride in this
                       house.

     CATHY starts up the stairs.

                            CATHY
                       I'll remind them.

     DELIA calls after her daughter.

                            DELIA
                       Something spectacular, Cathy!

     When CATHY is out of hearing.

                            DELIA (cont)
                       Then out they go.


     INT: SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY -- DAY

     CATHY  comes  up from the first floor.   She drops her  book  bag
     inside the door of her room,  and goes softly on.  She's going to
     pass  the open door of her father's study.   He's talking to  his
     ex-wife and agent on the telephone.

     CATHY starts to creep by the room, but suddenly

     CHARLES'S ARM

     reaches out and grabs her, and pulls her inside.


     INT: CHARLES'S STUDY -- DAY

     As usual, two or three printers are going full blast.

     CHARLES hangs up the telephone, and hugs CATHY close.

                            CHARLES
                       You know what?

                            CATHY
                       What?

                            CHARLES
                       I just did a four-book
                       contract with lay-backs
                       to hard cover, with
                       eight and ten breaking
                       at a hundred and fifty.
                       You know what that means?

                            CATHY
                       No.

                            CHARLES
                       You're going to be the only
                       girl in the fourth grade
                       with your own Limited
                       Partnership Real Estate
                       Tax Shelter.

     TELEPHONE  rings,  and  CHARLES  instantly puts  CATHY  down  and
     answers the telephone.  CATHY rungs out.

                            CHARLES
                       Hello?


     INT: ATTIC -- DAY

     ADAM  and CATHY are poring over the model.   ADAM is looking at a
     series of Polaroid photographs that CATHY has brought in.

                            CATHY
                       When people asked why I was
                       taking pictures of everything,
                       I told them it was a school
                       project.

     BARBARA comes up.

                            ADAM
                       Here's a headline for you.
                       A friend of Cathy's mother
                       just bought our appliance store,
                       and turned it into a Jello
                       stand.

                            CATHY
                       Not jello.  Gelloto.

                            BARBARA
                       What's gelloto?

                            CATHY
                       Well, it tastes just like ice
                       cream, but it costs about three
                       times as much.  Beverly says
                       she's filling a need and will
                       make a fortune.

     BARBARA starts looking through the Polaroids.

                            BARBARA
                       Beverly is your mother's friend?

                            CATHY
                       She just moved here, and
                       Beverly's ex-husband and his
                       Chinese boyfriend are moving up
                       next month.  They bought the
                       old Baptist Church and are going
                       to set up an Academy of Aerobic
                       Self-Defense.

                            ADAM
                       Defense against what?

                            CATHY
                       Muggers.

                            BARBARA
                       Nobody has ever been mugged in
                       Winter River.

                            CATHY
                       Beverly was.  But Mommy says
                       Beverly has a victim complex.

     ADAM and BARBARA are getting insight into a world they never knew
     existed.

                            ADAM
                       There certainly have been
                       a lot of changes recently.

                            CATHY
                       Mommy wanted me to remind
                       you about her party on the
                       thirtieth.

                            BARBARA
                       We haven't forgotten.

     ADAM and BARBARA exchange troubled glances.

                            CATHY
                       I think it's really great
                       that all you guys are working
                       together now.  I feel like
                       I've got two families.  I just
                       wish they could see you the
                       way I can.

                            ADAM
                       Honey, could you go downstairs?
                       Barbara and I need to talk for
                       a few minutes.  But come back
                       up in a little while and visit
                       us.

                            CATHY
                       Sure.

     She leaves.

                            BARBARA
                       I hope we're doing the right
                       thing.

                            ADAM
                       There was nothing else --

     NOISE OF A MOTORCYCLE --

     turns  their  attention towards the model town.   They peer  down
     into --

     MODEL TOWN --

     BEETLE  JUICE is riding down Main Street on a Mo-Ped.   ADAM  and
     BARBARA hover above him like titans in the sky.

     BEETLE JUICE does wheelies, and comes to an abrupt halt.

                            BEETLE JUICE
                       Real cute kid, hunh?

     He drags down the length of the street.

                            BEETLE JUICE
                       I'm gonna use my imagination
                       on that one.

     BARBARA'S  HAND reaches down into the model,  and  plucks  BEETLE
     JUICE  off  the  Mo-Ped.   The Mo-Ped spins forward  and  crashes
     through a doorway in one of the model buildings.

     BARBARA lifts him up towards her squeezing him slightly.

                            BARBARA
                       I don't know what you've
                       got in mind for their party
                       but leave her out of it.

     CU: BEETLE JUICE IN BARBARA'S HAND

     BEETLE JUICE grins.  Suddenly large spikes shoot out all over his
     body, piercing the skin of BARBARA's palm and fingers.  BARBARA's
     blood is a rich pink.

     She  releases  the evil spirit and  he  plummets.   BEETLE  JUICE
     parachutes to a soft landing on the town common.

                            BEETLE JUICE
                       Watch it.  I can work
                       against you, too.

     BEETLE JUICE suddenly lightens up.

                            BEETLE JUICE (cont)
                       But don't worry about that
                       little girl.  I'm more
                       interested in her sister.


     INT: EVELYN'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

     EVELYN  is  CHARLES's  agent and ex-wife;  she  is  also  LYDIA's
     mother.   Her apartment is in a section of Queens recently become
     fashionable.

     EVELYN is on the phone to CHARLES.   LYDIA stands by,  wearing an
     outfit even more outrageous than before, impatient.

                            EVELYN
                       (Into telephone)  She
                       promises she'll be home
                       by six in the morning,
                       Charles.  But I told her
                       I had to check with you
                       first.

     EVELYN listens for a moment.

                            EVELYN
                       Fine.  I'll talk to you
                       tomorrow.

     She turns to LYDIA.

                            EVELYN
                       All right.  You can go.
                       If you promise to take
                       taxis, and not use any
                       drugs you didn't bring
                       from home.


     EXT: RAPTURE -- NIGHT

     Rapture  is the newest and trendiest New York club,  located in a
     deconsecrated church.

     Four  hundred  Death Rockers are milling around on the  sidewalk,
     waiting for entrance.

     Over the door is a banner reading: TONIGHT ONLY / DANNY DEATH.


     INT: RAPTURE -- NIGHT

     The interior of Rapture has been decorated as the Halls of  Hell,
     in   stylish  black  and  red.    The  crowd  is  equal  to   its
     surroundings.

     We  find LYDIA standing very near the stage area,  surrounded  by
     half a dozen of her old friends from New York.

     They  are  watching one of the evening Talent Acts,  which  is  a
     MAGICIAN  performing the coffin and swords trick to the thrashing
     pre-recorded music of Motorhead.  A YOUNG WOMAN enters an upright
     coffin  and  the  door is shut,  in a way that  leaves  her  face
     exposed.   The MAGICIAN plunges, one after the other, five swords
     through  slits in the coffin.   He holds up the sixth  and  final
     sword,  and  then  plunges it straight through the young  woman's
     breast.

     The YOUNG WOMAN screams,  and a LONG ARC OF SPURTING BLOOD  spews
     out into the audience,  spraying LYDIA's friends.   On stage, the
     MAGICIAN  withdraws the six swords,  and opens the  coffin.   The
     YOUNG WOMAN, with a bloody gash in her breast spills out onto the
     stage.

     The crowd applauds madly as the stage goes completely black.   In
     the audience, LYDIA wipes the stage blood from her face.

                            LYDIA
                       This stuff is so lame.
                       None of it's real.

     FRIEND #1 turns to FRIEND #2.

                            FRIEND #1
                       If she mentions those
                       goddamn ghosts of hers
                       one more time I'm going
                       to puke in her cleavage.

                            LYDIA
                       I have touched the other
                       side, you people.  And if
                       you don't believe me just
                       wait till next Saturday
                       night.

     Suddenly,  there is the very loud and very eerie violin obliggato
     coming from everywhere.

     Then,  on the blackened appear TWO YELLOW SNAKE'S EYES.   Then, a
     moment later, we see shape of a violin outlined in white neon.

     The lights come up gradually and luridly,  to reveal BEETLE JUICE
     / DANNY DEATH,  alone on the stage with his electric neon violin.
     He  has been transformed into the ultimate DEATH ROCKER.   For  a
     few moments,  the eerie solo violin continues to play, bringing a
     surprising hush over the audience.   Then,  in a hugely amplified
     version of his own voice,  we hear him recite the following poem,
     to the accompaniment of his violin.

                            BEETLE JUICE / DANNY DEATH
                       Young soul, put off your flesh and come
                       With me into the quiet tomb.
                       Our bed is lovely, dark and sweet
                       The earth will swing us as she goes
                       Beneath our coverlid of snows
                       And the warm leaden sheet.

     By  this  time  he  is  at the front  of  the  stage,  before  an
     enthralled  audience.   No  one however is more  enthralled  than
     LYDIA, for it becomes apparent that BEETLE JUICE / DANNY DEATH is
     directing his words solely to her.

                            BEETLE JUICE / DANNY DEATH
                       Dear and dear is their poisoned note
                       The little snakes of silver throat
                       In mossy skulls that nest and lie
                       Ever singing, "Die, Oh die!"

                            FRIEND #3
                       He wants your body.

                            LYDIA
                       Shhh!

     Like a demonic Bruce Sprinsteen, BEETLE JUICE / DANNY DEATH pulls
     LYDIA up onto the stage,  and in his own voice, repeats the final
     chorus directly to her.

                            BEETLE JUICE / DANNY DEATH
                       Sweet and sweet is their poisoned note
                       The little snakes of silver throat
                       In mossy skulls that nest and lie
                       Ever singing "Die, Oh die!"

     When  BEETLE JUICE / DANNY DEATH finishes,  there's a  moment  of
     awed silence.   Then as the applause begins, BEETLE JUICE / DANNY
     DEATH walks off stage, leading LYDIA away.

     In the audience, LYDIA's friends watch with astonishment.

                            FRIEND #1
                       Wait'll he finds out she
                       lives in Connecticut.

     FRIEND  #2 takes out his lighter in order to light his cigarette.
     When  he flicks the light,  an enormous jet of BRIGHT BLUE  FLAME
     bursts out.  Everyone draws back.

                            FRIEND #3
                       Blue flame.  That means
                       there's an evil spirit
                       present.

     All  their  eyes drift in the direction of BEETLE JUICE  /  DANNY
     DEATH and LYDIA, who have made their way to the bar.

     AT THE BAR --

     BEETLE JUICE / DANNY DEATH has bought LYDIA and himself a Coke.

                            BEETLE JUICE / DANNY DEATH
                       What are you doing next Saturday
                       night?

                            LYDIA
                       I'm giving a party.  (Beat)
                       Would you like to come?

     BEETLE JUICE / DANNY DEATH hesitates.

                            LYDIA
                       (Sounding like the
                       sixteen-year-old she is)
                       We're gonna have real
                       ghosts.

                            BEETLE JUICE / DANNY DEATH
                       Wouldn't miss it.


     EXT: MAIN STREET, WINTER RIVER -- DAY

     It  is a billiant fall day,  as the DEETZ's silver BMW turns onto
     Main Street.

     Main  Street  is  showing  evidence of the  first  incursions  of
     Manhattan.   While it is still charming and unpretentious for the
     most  part,  BEVERLY'S  GELOTTO,  with  its  arrogant,  high-tech
     exterior,  bodes  ill  for  the future of this  small  town  Main
     Street.


     INT: DEETZ'S BMW -- DAY

     DELIA  driving,  LYDIA  in the front seat,  CATHY  in  the  back,
     looking out of the window.

                            LYDIA
                       Delia, he was great.  I
                       mean, the audience was
                       totally silent, and he
                       had this neon violin,
                       and he pulled me up on
                       stage, and we talked
                       all night long, and he
                       promised he'd come to
                       the party, and I have
                       him directions and
                       everything, and he said
                       he might even sing.

                            DELIA
                       Well, we don't want to
                       steal focus from Cathy's
                       ghosts.  But maybe we
                       could set up something
                       out in the barn.  He
                       could use my sculptures
                       and do a kind of
                       environmental piece.


     EXT: MAIN STREET -- DAY

     DELIA  pulls  the  BMW into a parking space in front of  the  DRY
     CLEANERS.


     INT: DRY CLEANERS -- DAY

     -- A CLOUD OF WHITE STEAM

     From the middle of which shine out two YELLOW SNAKE'S EYES.

     As the eyes gradually humanize,  and the steam dissipates, we see
     BEETLE JUICE as an OLD WOMAN, operating a steam press at the back
     of  the  dry cleaning establishment.   In  tight  grey  curls,  a
     flowered dress,  and practical shoes,  BEETLE JUICE looks like  a
     old New England shopkeeper.

     DELIA comes in the front door, and throws several strange-looking
     outfits across the counter, and looks about impatiently.

                            BEETLE JUICE/OLD WOMAN
                       Be with in a moment, dear.

     DELIA waits two seconds, and then in a voice that is still trying
     to be pleasant:

                            DELIA
                       I hate to be a nuisance,
                       but this isn't the only
                       stop I have to make today.

     BEETLE  JUICE / OLD WOMAN cuts the power on the steam press,  and
     comes to the front of the shop between two long mechanized racks.
     He is walking with a limp and a cane.

                            BEETLE JUICE / OLD WOMAN
                       I'm sorry -- I don't move
                       as quickly as I used to.
                       I lost four toes last
                       winter.  Frostbite.  You
                       never think it can happen
                       to you till it happens
                       to you.

     DELIA does not want to hear more of this story.

                            DELIA
                       I have to have these by
                       Saturday.

     BEETLE JUICE examines the avant-garde outfits.

                            BEETLE JUICE / OLD WOMAN
                       They are dresses,
                       aren't they, dear?

                            DELIA
                       (Wondering if that was a dig)
                       You know how to take care
                       of material like this, don't
                       you?

                            BEETLE JUICE / OLD WOMAN
                       I've been running this place
                       for twenty-six years, ever
                       since Dad died.  Dad was my
                       second husband.  He had a
                       heart attack on Arbor Day.
                       He was planting that big
                       spruce in front of...

                            DELIA
                       Do you deliver?

                            BEETLE JUICE / OLD WOMAN
                       I'll bring them out myself.


     EXT: MAIN STREET -- DAY

     Piloted by the fuming DELIA,  the BMW screeches away from the dry
     cleaners.   Halfway  down the block,  the BMW scatters an  entire
     troupe of Brownies.


     INT: DRY CLEANERS -- DAY

     BEETLE  JUICE   / OLD WOMAN stands behind the  counter,  his  old
     woman's face a death mask, with YELLOW SNAKE'S EYES embedded it.

     Behind  him,  the DRY CLEANING RACKS spin around wildly  with  an
     UNEARTHLY CLATTER.


     INT: STEAM ROOM - NEW YORK ATHLETIC CLUB -- DAY

     Full of steam.  CHARLES and OTHO, swathed in towels, sit sweating
     on benches.

                            OTHO
                       What are you in town for?

                            CHARLES
                       I'm arranging the catering
                       for Saturday night.

                            OTHO
                       Oh let me go with you.

                            CHARLES
                       We're having a sushi room,
                       and a tapas room, and your old
                       friend Alfredo is doing a
                       chocolate construction.

                            OTHO
                       Christ, how much is that
                       going to cost?  Chocolate
                       constructions don't come
                       cheap, and once you start
                       taking sushi across state
                       lines you're talking real
                       money.

                            CHARLES
                       Otho, what difference does
                       it make?  I'm writing this
                       whole party off my taxes.
                       And Delia's writing it off
                       of hers.  Our whole goddamn
                       lives are deductible.  Taxes
                       are just a game that you play
                       against the IRS and I always
                       make sure that I win.

                            OTHO
                       I wish somebody'd teach me how to
                       play.

                            CHARLES
                       It's easy.  You just learn how to
                       make them play by your rules.  (Beat)
                       Feels like it's getting hot in here.
                       Let's go.

     CHARLES and OTHO get up and leave the steam room.

     At  the far end of the room is a sudden,  agitated  billowing  of
     steam.

     BEETLE  JUICE,  with STARING YELLOW EYES,  steps forward.   He is
     wearing  a  perfectly pressed,  perfectly  dry  three-piece  pin-
     striped suit.   He's  wearing  round wire-frame  glasses,  and  a
     narrow-brimmed  hat.   He  is  carrying  a  briefcase,  with  the
     initialled monogram IRS.

     He walks out of the steam room.


     INT: LOCKER ROOM -- DAY

     BEETLE  JUICE / IRS,   unnoticed,  passes the shower room,  where
     CHARLES and OTHO are slowly turning under adjoining taps.

     He  passes  a row of lockers,  attracting the notice of a  deeply
     tanned YUPPIE jock, who is about to open his locker.

     As  BEETLE JUICE / IRS leaves,  the YUPPIE turns back to his  now
     open locker, just in time to be CLOBBERED ON THE CHIN by a boxing
     glove that shoots out of the locker on a spring.   The YUPPIE  is
     smashed against the opposite wall of lockers.

     The other men in the locker room do double-takes.









     -----------------------------------------------------------------


     EXT: HOUSE -- DAY

     The  day of the party.   Caterers vans pulled  up.   Workmen  are
     putting  out table,  and erecting a lighting system that wouldn't
     be out of place in Madison Square Gardens.

     CATHY  rides up to the house on her bicycle.   She weaves her way
     with difficulty through the workmen.   She takes the pack off her
     back,  and  removes  the mail that she's brought  from  the  post
     office.


     INT: LIVING ROOM AND FOYER -- DAY

     CATHY comes in the front door.   Just as much pandeominum inside.
     Caterers, people rearranging the furniture, DELIA is there with a
     torch and mask, putting final touches on her water clock.

                            CATHY
                       I brought the mail.

                            DELIA
                       Have you put out the
                       guest towels yet?

                            CATHY
                       I was going to do it
                       right now.

     DELIA is looking through the mail as CATHY starts up the stairs.

                            DELIA
                       Remember, folded in quarters,
                       creases to the left.

     DELIA comes across a letter that puts the fear of God in her.

                            DELIA
                       CHARLES!

     CHARLES is at that moment coming out of the kitchen,  through the
     dining room.

     DELIA hands the letter to him.

                            DELIA
                       It's from the IRS.

     Without a word, CHARLES tears into the letter.

                            DELIA
                       It's an audit, isn't it?

                            CHARLES
                       Yes.

                            DELIA
                       Call the accountant on
                       Monday.  He'll take care
                       of it.

     DELIA leaves.

                            CHARLES
                       (To himself)  No.  I'll call
                       him right now.  This is --

     An insinuating voice sounds behind CHARLES.

                            BEETLE JUICE / IRS
                       It's a little late for
                       that, Mr. Deetz.

     BEETLE  JUICE is standing there,  in the guise of the IRS man  we
     saw in the steam room.

                            CHARLES
                       Who are you?

                            BEETLE JUICE / IRS
                       My name is Irving Roger Smith.

     He points the monogram on his briefcase: IRS.

                            CHARLES
                       (With misgiving)  But what
                       are you doing here?

                            BEETLE JUICE / IRS
                       Look at your notice, Mr.
                       Deetz.  Our appointment is
                       for today.

                            CHARLES
                       But you have to give warning
                       for an audit.

                            BEETLE JUICE / IRS
                       Look at the envelope.  That
                       notice was mailed four weeks
                       ago.  Because we didn't hear
                       from you, we concluded that
                       the appointment was confirmed.

                            CHARLES
                       But I just got the notice
                       today.

                            BEETLE JUICE / IRS
                       That's between you and the USPS,
                       Mr. Deetz.

                            CHARLES
                       In case you haven't noticed,
                       we're giving a little party
                       tonight, Mr. Smith.

                            BEETLE JUICE / IRS
                       The first think I need to see
                       is every bank statement and
                       deposit receipt for the past
                       three years.


     INT: CATHY'S ROOM -- DAY

     CATHY and BARBARA are folding towels.

                            BARBARA
                       This is going to be some
                       party isn't it?  Is it going
                       to be a cookout?

                            CATHY
                       No, but there's going to
                       be twenty-seven different
                       kinds of raw fish.
                       (Diffidently)  Have you
                       decided what you're going to
                       do tonight?  Mom wants you to
                       make sure it's something
                       really special.

                            BARBARA
                       (Uncomfortable)  Adam and
                       I have figured out a few
                       things.

                            CATHY
                       I'm really glad you're doing
                       this.  I think it will help.
                       Also, it'll be nice to have
                       some of my friends at the
                       party.

                            BARBARA
                       (Too quickly)  Why don't stay
                       upstairs with us tonight?  We'll
                       have our own little party.

                            CATHY
                       I can't really.  Besides,
                       you guys --

     A CHAIN SAW --

     interrupts  their  conversation.    BARBARA  and  CATHY  exchange
     glances and go to the window.

     THEIR POV --

     WORKMEN   are  hewing  down ADAM's orchard in order  to  erect  a
     massive striped tent.


     INT: UPSTAIRS HALLWAY -- DAY

     CHARLES is leading BEETLE JUICE / IRS down the hill,  towards his
     study.  CHARLES moves like a convict going to execution.

     CATHY hurtles out of her room and throws herself on CHARLES.

                            CATHY
                       Daddy!  Daddy!  They're
                       cutting down the orchard.

                            CHARLES
                       Not now, Cathy.

                            CATHY
                       It has to be now.  They're --

                            CHARLES
                       NOT NOW!

     He  and  BEETLE JUICE / IRS move on.   At the door of  the  study
     BEETLE JUICE / IRS turns and smiles at CATHY.


     INT: ATTIC -- DAY

     ADAM is lying on the floor,  looking out a window.  He is weeping
     at the loss of his orchard.

     He gets up, looks at BARBARA.

                            ADAM
                       I don't care what he
                       does to those people
                       tonight.


     INT: LIVING ROOM -- DAY

     CATHY and DELIA are in the middle of a heated argument.

                            DELIA
                       Cathy, we've got a
                       hundred and thirty-five
                       people coming to this
                       house in a matter of
                       hours.  Don't come at
                       me with this bullshit
                       about trees.

                            CATHY
                       But --

                            DELIA
                       They were going anyway.
                       Otho and I are putting
                       in a Japanese meditation
                       garden.

     CATHY  stares  at  her mother for a moment,  and  then  runs  out
     through the dining room.


     INT: CHARLES'S STUDY

     BEETLE  JUICE / IRS is seated in front of a table that is stacked
     high with CHARLES's financial records.

                            BEETLE JUICE / IRS
                       Some people, Mr. Deetz,
                       think that taxes are just
                       a game to be played against
                       the IRS.

     CHARLES starts to sweat.

                            BEETLE JUICE / IRS (cont)
                       Mr. Deetz, the IRS plays
                       hardball.

                            CHARLES
                       Ah, can I get you something
                       from downstairs.  A little plate
                       of octopus or something?

                            BEETLE JUICE / IRS
                       (Smiling)  I'm afraid not,
                       Mr. Deetz.  That would con-
                       stitute bribery.  I know
                       you have a party to give,
                       so why don't you just leave
                       me alone for a while?  If I
                       need you, I know where to find
                       you.

     Humbly, CHARLES walks out of the study.


     INT: HALLWAY -- DAY

     CHARLES leans against the door,  deflated.  He thinks of one more
     bit of excuse-making and starts to open the door again.

     The door is locked.

     He backs away in distress.


     INT: CHARLES'S STUDY -- DAY

     BEETLE JUICE / IRS gets up from the table, and goes to the window.

     HIS POV --

     The orchard is almost levelled,  but the trees nearest the  house
     remain standing.  CATHY is watching, grief-stricken.


     EXT: BACK YARD -- DAY

     CATHY  looks  up at the house,  having sensed  that  someone  was
     watching her.

     No  one  appears in the study window.   CATHY looks back  to  the
     enormous  truck that is eating up and shredding the toppled fruit
     trees at an amazing clip.

     OUT OF THE OPEN STUDY WINDOW --

     A  FUZZY-TAILED SQUIRREL makes a nearly superatural leap into the
     branches of the last remaining fruit tree.

     A WORKMAN applies the chain saw to the trunk of this tree, and in
     a brief moment it topples to the ground.

     The SQUIRREL is flung free,  and lands stunned -- if not dead  --
     at CATHY's feet.

     CATHY  tenderly lifts the SQUIRREL and listens to its heart-beat.
     It shudders in her hands, and weakly raises a GASHED PAW.

                            CATHY
                       You're bleeding.

     She  clutches  the SQUIRREL to her breast and  runs  towards  the
     house.


     INT: CATHY'S ROOM -- DAY

     The  SQUIRREL is lying in on a fluffed up towel in a wooden  box.
     Its  paw  is bandaged,  and CATHY is feeding it water from a  eye
     dropped.   It drinks the water eagerly,  but still has not opened
     its eyes.

                            CATHY
                       I'd feel a lot better
                       if you'd just open your
                       eyes.

     From outside, we heard DELIA's frantic voice.

                            DELIA (v.o.)
                       Cathy, where are the
                       guest towels?

                            CATHY
                       Coming!

     She  closes the hinged lid of the box,  and pushes it  under  her
     bed.

                            CATHY
                       I'll check on you in
                       a little smile.

     CATHY hurries out of the room, with the towels.

     INSIDE THE BOX --

     The  SQUIRREL opens his eyes.   They're COLD AND YELLOW,  SNAKE'S
     EYES.


     INT: FOYER -- DAY

     OTHO  has  arrived,  and  is carrying a small  suitcase.   He  is
     wearing an enormous fur coat,  complete with hood,  Norfolk belt,
     and contrasting pockets.   Whole forests of cute animals perished
     to make this tent.

                            DELIA
                       Thank God you're here.
                       We've got the IRS upstairs,
                       Cathy pouting in corners,
                       I can't find Lydia, Charles
                       is sloshing his way through
                       a second pitcher of Long
                       Island Iced Tea, and the dress
                       I'm supposed to wear tonight
                       has <u>not</u> arrived from the
                       cleaners.

                            OTHO
                       Take me to my room, you poor
                       creature.  I brought a suitcase
                       full of calm.

     They start up the stairs.


     INT: UPSTAIRS HALLWAY -- DAY

     It's  empty.   The door of CATHY's room slowly opens.   Out steps
     BEETLE JUICE as the OLD WOMAN from the cleaners.   He is carrying
     DELIA's clothes in plastic bags.

     He  steps  directly across the hallway,  and  enters  the  MASTER
     BEDROOM.


     INT: MASTER BEDROOM -- DAY

     OTHO   has  spread  out  a  pharmacopeia  of  legal  and  illegal
     substances on DELIA's dressing table, and is allowing her to sort
     through.

                            OTHO
                       The pink now, the blue
                       in fifteen minutes, let
                       those take effect and then
                       take a couple of reds
                       with a glass of apple
                       juice.  That's what
                       I'd do.

     DELIA  looks  up  at BEETLE JUICE / OLD  WOMAN  standing  in  the
     doorway.

                            DELIA
                       What are you doing up here?

                            BEETLE JUICE / OLD WOMAN
                       I knocked and knocked, and
                       nobody came, so I just
                       walked on in, and your
                       daughter told me to bring
                       these on up here, so here
                       I am, and you must have a
                       terrible cold.

     BEETLE  JUICE  / OLD WOMAN is eyeing the drugs,  which  OTHO  has
     swept back into his enormous plastic Baggie.

                            OTHO
                       Delia, I think I'm going
                       to unpack.

                            DELIA
                       I'll come with you.  (To
                       BEETLE JUICE / OLD WOMAN)  Just
                       hang the clothes on the door.

     DELIA gets up and goes out after OTHO.

     BEETLE  JUICE / OLD WOMAN goes to DELIA's closet door  and  opens
     it.  It is jammed with expensive clothes.

                            BEETLE JUICE / OLD WOMAN
                       My, my.  Such a wardrobe.

     BEETLE  JUICE  / OLD WOMAN's eyes dehumanize.   They're COLD  and
     YELLOW.


     EXT: WINTER RIVER TRAIN STATION -- DUSK

     The six o'clock train from New York is pulling in.   Half a dozen
     native Winter Riverites get off the train, carrying shopping bags
     bearing  the logos of Manhattan stores.   After them come four of
     LYDIA's DEATH ROCKER friends.  We saw them at RAPTURE.

     LYDIA  gives  them  hasty greetings,  but it's  apparent  she  is
     looking for and hoping to see someone else.

     She leads them over to the car,  which she is driving.  She walks
     apart with her best friend in the group,  TRIXIE.  (It's her real
     name.)

                            LYDIA
                       Oh God, I feel like a
                       jerk.  I met every single
                       train from New York and
                       he's not here yet.

                            TRIXIE
                       You are a jerk.  He's
                       not coming.

                            LYDIA
                       He promised.  And Delia's
                       going to kill me, because
                       I haven't been at the house
                       all day.

     As they're all piling into the car:

                            TRIXIE
                       Maybe he died and that's
                       why he couldn't come.


     EXT: THE HOUSE -- DUSK

     No  more  WORKMEN,   no  more  VANS.    Everything's  ready,  and
     apparently calm.  The strings of party lights on on, illuminating
     the tent behind.

     It would all be very pretty if we didn't know that ADAM's orchard
     had been razed for this.


     INT: MASTER BATHROOM -- DUSK

     DELIA is at the mirror,  with a towel wrapped around her.  She is
     drying her hair.

     CHARLES  lies in the bathtub,  nearly comatose,  with the  shower
     running  full blast onto his face.

                            CHARLES
                       That man is still locked
                       in my study.

                            DELIA
                       (Totally unsympathetic)
                       We've got fifteen minutes
                       to get dressed.

     DELIA walks out of the bedroom.


     INT: MASTER BEDROOM -- DUSK

     DELIA walks in, and to her astonishment, finds

     BEETLE JUICE / OLD WOMAN

     calmly sitting on the corner of the bed.

                            DELIA
                       What the hell are you still
                       doing here?

                            BEETLE JUICE / OLD WOMAN
                       I was waiting for my money.
                       That's fifteen seventy.

                            DELIA
                       Oh God.  Look, wait out in
                       the hall.  I'll get it in
                       a minute.

                            BEETLE JUICE / OLD WOMAN
                       I hope you don't mind, but
                       I rearranged your closet a
                       little.  It was in such a
                       mess.

                            DELIA
                       What?  Oh, just get out --

     BEETLE JUICE / OLD WOMAN leaves the room, as DELIA is opening the
     closet door.


     INT: THE HALLWAY -- DUSK

     BEETLE  JUICE / OLD WOMAN stands demurely at the  door,  waiting.
     He's waiting for --

     DELIA'S BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAMS

     When they come, he smiles an old lady's smile of satisfaction.


     INT: MASTER BEDROOM -- DUSK

     CHARLES runs in from the bathroom,  with (or without) towel,  and
     finds DELIA ripping through her closet like a woman possessed.

     Great  piles  of the ugliest and cheapest and gaudiest  polyester
     blend clothing imaginable have been strewn on the floor.

     DELIA turns to her husband savagely.

                            DELIA
                       There is not one article
                       of clothing in that closet
                       which does not bear the
                       label K-Mart.

     She holds up a muu-muu.

                            DELIA
                       That old woman is going
                       to die.

     DELIA flies out of the bedroom,  leaving CHARLES reaching for the
     pitcher of New England iced tea.


     INT: HALLWAY -- DUSK

     DELIA confronts BEETLE JUICE / OLD WOMAN.

                            DELIA
                       Get ready to die!

     And by George, she does.

     BEETLE  JUICE / OLD WOMAN's face blanches  instantly.   Her  eyes
     bulge  and roll crazily.   Her blackened tongue unrolls from  her
     mouth.  Her heart palpitates visibly through her dress.

     DELIA's rage turns to horror.

                            DELIA
                       Oh god, don't die.

     Pulling  herself  up from the depths,  BEETLE JUICE /  OLD  WOMAN
     manages to croak out reassurance.

                            BEETLE JUICE / OLD WOMAN
                       I'll be all right.  I just
                       need my pills, and I have to
                       lie down for a few minutes.

     BEETLE JUICE/ OLD WOMAN staggers into OTHO's room,  and collapses
     on the bed, with DELIA following.


     INT. OTHO'S ROOM -- DUSK

                            DELIA
                       Right.  Don't die.  Just
                       lie down.  We've got plenty
                       of pills.  (Calling)  Otho!

     BEETLE JUICE / OLD WOMAN seems to recover a little.

                            BEETLE JUICE / OLD WOMAN
                       I'll be all right.  Just 
                       leave me alone for a little
                       while.  And when I'm feeling
                       a little better, I'll get
                       up and leave.  I don't want
                       to disturb your party.

                            DELIA
                       What about my clothes?

     BEETLE JUICE / OLD WOMAN starts to hyperventilate.

                            DELIA
                       No, no, don't do that.

     DELIA backs out of the room.


     INT: UPSTAIRS HALLWAY -- DUSK

     DELIA  comes out of OTHO's room,  just as LYDIA is coming up  the
     stairs from the first floor.

                            DELIA
                       Lydia, find Otho, and tell
                       him I need five of the red
                       ones, and I need them right
                       now.

                            LYDIA
                       Listen, I'm sorry I was 
                       gone --

     DELIA  doesn't  care.   She  flings open the door of  the  master
     bedroom, and disappears inside.

     The door of OTHO's room opens again, and out steps BEETLE JUICE /
     DANNY DEATH.

     LYDIA melts.

                            LYDIA
                       Oh God.  You came.
                       You really came.

                            BEETLE JUICE / DANNY DEATH
                       I told you.  I wouldn't
                       miss it.









     -----------------------------------------------------------------



     EXT: THE TENT -- NIGHT

     ADAM's  orchard is now covered with a wooden platform,  on  which
     half a dozen groaning tables have been laid out.

     The  DEETZ's  party is comprised of three  distinct  groups:  the
     literary  world (CHARLES),  the art world (DELIA),  and the DEATH
     ROCKERS (LYDIA).   These three groups mix rather better than  one
     would imagine.   Certainly they're jostling one another to get at
     the food.

     CHARLES  sits morosely alone near the corner of the tent,  with a
     pitcher  of Long Island Iced Tea between his legs.   A couple  of
     book types stand near him,  exchanging glances over his head.  As
     CHARLES  talks  in his drunkeness,  he stares up at  the  lighted
     window of his study.

                            CHARLES
                       If I put it in a book
                       nobody'd believe it.
                       The IRS shows up, no
                       warning, he's in there
                       for seven hours, hasn't
                       even come out to take
                       a piss, God knows what
                       he's looking for, God
                       knows what he's gonna
                       find.

                            BOOKY #1
                       They never throw you in
                       jail unless they're able
                       to prove fraud.

     CHARLES half-laughs, half-moans, and sinks back in his chair.

     BEETLE  JUICE / IRS suddenly appears in the lighted  window,  and
     waves to CHARLES.


     INT: THE BARN AND SCULPTURE GALLERY -- NIGHT

     DELIA's sculptures, entirely too many of them, have been arranged
     for maximum effect.

     Two  CRITICS stand in front of one of the more characteristic  of
     DELIA's  pieces.   They seem to be examining it  intently.   They
     walk around it together.  They come back to their original place.

                            CRITIC #1
                       Truly magnificent.

                            CRITIC #2
                       I know.  I have never seen
                       such a pair of tits on a
                       sixteen-year-old.

     Directly in their sight-line is LYDIA's friend TRIXIE.

     TRIXIE  gives  a  disgusted look to  the  CRITICS,  knowing  what
     they're critiquing.  She slouches towards LYDIA.

     LYDIA is holding forth to a group of her friends.

                            LYDIA
                       He is totally amazing.  All
                       the time I was down at the 
                       train station waiting for him,
                       he was out here with Delia's
                       creations.  Danny Death said
                       they were realer than real
                       life.

     DEATH  ROCKER #1,  who was probably LYDIA's boyfriend before  she
     came across DANNY DEATH, just looks disgusted.

                            DEATH ROCKER #1
                       (Sarcastic)  God, he's smart.
                       They look like total pre-
                       tentious crap to me.

                            LYDIA
                       Danny Death says that Delia
                       is working from a base of
                       total alienation.

                            TRIXIE
                       So where is he now?

                            LYDIA
                       Well, he's got this whole inner
                       life, and it's the true
                       reality, and sometimes it's
                       too much for him to deal
                       with.  So he went to lie
                       down for a minute.


     INT: OTHO'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     It's the room where all the guests have thrown their coats, which
     are now heaped in a very substantial pile on OTHO's bed.

     OTHO comes into the darkened room, and flicks on the light.  He's
     half-seas over already, and is brushing crumbs from his vest.

                            OTHO
                       Oh God, I know it's at
                       the very bottom of the
                       pile.

     Without regard for any of the other guests, he starts shoving the
     other coats on the floor.   After a few moments,  he own coat  is
     revealed in all its peculiar splendor.

     OTHO tries to lift his coat, but it won't come up from the bed.

     OTHO  pulls harder,  and then sees that two rictored hands have a
     vice-grip  on  the coat.   The hood falls back  and  reveals  the
     stark,  staring,  and  very  deceased face of BEETLE JUICE /  OLD
     WOMAN.

     OTHO  falls  back,  but  BEETLE JUICE / OLD WOMAN  remains  in  a
     sitting position on the bed.

     OTHO is now sober.


     INT: FOYER AND LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

     DELIA  is  greeting  late-arriving guests at the  door.   She  is
     wearing  the  muu-muu she found in her  closet,  tarted  up  with
     jewelry and belts and other accessories.  It is still, however, a
     polyester blend muu-muu.

     A  richly-gowned  MATRON is kissing DELIA on  either  cheek.   As
     DELIA pulls back, she says:

                            DELIA
                       Just put your coat in
                       the room at the top of
                       the stairs.

                            MATRON
                       I love your house.  I
                       try to tell everybody
                       that Connecticut is not
                       the end of the world.

     OTHO comes pounding down the stairs.

                            OTHO
                       Delia, we have a little
                       problem.


     INT: KITCHEN -- NIGHT

     Several GUESTS go out through the back door,  past one of DELIA's
     fellow  artists,  an anorexic chain-smoking action painter.   She
     leans  against  the stove,  nearly crushed  by  a  tweedy-looking
     PUBLISHER.

                            PUBLISHER
                       I have incredible respect
                       for the avant garde in
                       every field.

                            ARTIST
                       Ever get planked in a
                       laundry room?

     The PUBLISHER looks around the kitchen.

                            PUBLISHER
                       Which door?

     The ARTIST points to the laundry room door.   As the two of  them
     sidle inside, CATHY enters the kitchen from the dining room.

                            CATHY
                       I was looking for you
                       guys.

     The  ARTIST and the PUBLISHER stare at CATHY,  as if they'd never
     seen her before.

                            CATHY
                       Oh, not you.

     The  ARTIST  and the PUBLISHER look around  the  otherwise  empty
     kitchen, shrug, and disappear into the laundry room.

     CATHY'S POV --

     ADAM and BARBARA are perched on the counter.

                            BARBARA
                       Are all these people friends
                       of your parents?

                            CATHY
                       Maybe not friends exactly.
                       But part of their networks.

     OBVIOUS SEXUAL GROANS --

     come  out  from  behind  the  laundry  room  door.   CATHY  looks
     curiously in that direction.

                            ADAM
                       Why don't we go up to the
                       attic for a while?  You can
                       try to teach us how to play
                       gin rummy again.

                            CATHY
                       Okay, but I can't stay too
                       long.

     The  laundry room door starts to bang on its hinges.   The GROANS
     are more pronounced.

     ADAM  pulls  CATHY out through the dining  room.   BARBARA  stays
     behind a moment,  staring at the laundry room door.


     INT: LAUNDRY ROOM -- NIGHT

     The  PUBLISHER and the ARTIST are in a heavy embrace against  the
     door.   They're obviously up to something, but whatever it is has
     not prevented the ARTIST from chain-smoking.

     Suddenly,  there's a powerful kick against the door,  which sends
     the entwined couple toppling into a basket of dirty laundry.


     INT: KITCHEN -- NIGHT

     Dusting her hands for a job well done,  BARBARA follows ADAM  and
     CATHY into the dining room.


     INT: OTHO'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     DELIA  and OTHO are trying to flatten out the rictored of  BEETLE
     JUICE  /  OLD WOMAN.   They finally manage to do  so,  but  their
     stomachs turn at the sound of the CRACKING BONES.

                            OTHO
                       Do you want to call the
                       police?  Or an ambulance?

                            DELIA
                       I'm not having a dead woman
                       carted out of my party.
                       Tomorrow's good enough.
                       For right now, let's just
                       get her in the closet.

     OTHO gives DELIA a look, as if to say, "Are you sure?"

                            DELIA (cont)
                       She wasn't even invited.

     They heave to.


     INT: STAIRS TO SECOND FLOOR -- NIGHT

     Two  extraordinarily  weird-looking  ARTIST  sorts  perform   the
     tradition of gossipping viciously about the hosts.

                            ARTIST #1
                       Did you believe that weirdness
                       on the invitation about ghosts?
                       I mean, Delia is really reaching
                       this time, isn't she?

                            ARTIST #2
                       I think the whole family's
                       weird.

     ADAM, BARBARA, and CATHY approach the bottom of the stairs.

     ARTISTS' POV --

     CATHY trips on the bottom step.   But instead of falling,  she is
     lofted by invisible hands half a dozen steps higher.  She regains
     her balance, and continues up the stairs.

                            ARTIST #2
                       Exhibit A.


     INT: SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY -- NIGHT

     ADAM,  BARBARA,  AND  CATHY  pass OTHO and DELIA,  coming out  of
     OTHO's  bedroom.   OTHO and DELIA look like two people  who  have
     just hidden a corpse in the closet.

                            DELIA
                       (To Cathy)  It's a wonderful
                       party, isn't it darling?

                            CATHY
                       Yes, it is.

     ADAM  shoots DELIA a hateful look -- after all,  she cut down his
     orchard.  DELIA shivers.

                            DELIA
                       (To OTHO)  Brrr.

                            OTHO
                       I felt it too.

     DELIA and OTHO go downstairs.  CATHY, ADAM, and BARBARA go up the
     stairs  to the attic.   The hallway is temporarily  empty.   Then
     BEETLE  JUICE as the IRS agent creeps out of OTHO's bedroom,  and
     goes back into CHARLES's STUDY.


     EXT: THE TENT -- NIGHT

     We get the first indication that the party has been winding down.
     Most  of  the  food has been eaten (or dropped  on  the  ground).
     Everything looks unappetizing.   There are only a few people out,
     and the air is a little chill.

     CHARLES still sits at the corner of the tent,  staring up at  the
     lighted  window of his study,  working on yet another pitcher  of
     Long Island Iced Tea.

     He grabs the arm of a GUEST passing just then.

                            CHARLES
                       (Slurred) What time is
                       it?

                            GUEST
                       Eleven o'clock.  You don't
                       suppose you could bump up
                       the ghosts a little, do you?
                       I'm playing racketball at
                       six in the morning.

                            CHARLES
                       Ten hours.  That's how long
                       he's been up there.

     The  GUEST,  realizing  CHARLES has not even heard his  question,
     moves on.

     CHARLES POV --

     BEETLE  JUICE  / IRS appears in the windows,  and calls  down  to
     CHARLES.

                            BEETLE JUICE / IRS
                       Mr. Deetz, I'm reading for you
                       now.


     INT: UPSTAIRS BATHROOM -- NIGHT

     Sitting  at a long make-up table are LYDIA and a very upper-class
     matronly WOMAN.   Expressionlessly,  the MATRON watches LYDIA  as
     she revamps her DEATH ROCKER make-up, primping for DANNY DEATH.

                            MATRON
                       What color is that, dear?

                            LYDIA
                       It's called Agent Orange.

                            MATRON
                       Mind if I try it?

     LYDIA passes it over.

                            MATRON
                       Is it true about the ghosts,
                       or is Lydia having on with
                       us again?

                            LYDIA
                       Well, I can't see them.
                       But my sister can.  They're
                       supposed to come down at
                       midnight and move ashtrays
                       or something.


     INT: UPSTAIRS HALLWAY -- NIGHT

     CHARLES  is  standing at the opened door of  his  study.   BEETLE
     JUICE  / IRS is standing just inside the room,  as if barring the
     entrance.

                            BEETLE JUICE / IRS
                       Well, it looks like I'm
                       going to be working on this
                       one through the night.

                            CHARLES
                       Oh God.

                            BEETLE JUICE / IRS
                       But I thought I'd give you
                       a progress report.  I found a
                       $58,000 discrepancy between
                       your bank deposits and your
                       reported income, and so far
                       I've come across approximately
                       $160,000 in unallowable
                       deductions.  I telephoned my
                       superior, and we've decided
                       to widen the audit to include
                       the previous three years.

     CHARLES is speechless with horror.

                            BEETLE JUICE / IRS
                       And Mr. Deetz, this is what I
                       think of your Schedule W.

     He sends a PILE-DRIVING FIST into CHARLES's stomach, doubling him
     over, then slams the door in CHARLES's face.

                            CHARLES
                       Oh God...

     Still doubled over,  with the Long Island teas churning ominously
     in his bellow, CHARLES lurches down the hallway.

     At  that  moment,  EVELYN  comes  up  the  stairs,  with  a  very
     distinguished looking elderly gentleman.

                            EVELYN
                       Oh here you are, Charles.
                       I'd like you to meet the
                       editor-in-chief of Ballantine
                       Books.  He's very interested
                       in your ghosts.

     CHARLES makes a feeble attempt to straighten up.   It is too much
     for his stomach.

     By the WRETCHING SOUNDS and shocked expression on the publisher's
     face,  it  is  obvious  that CHARLES has just thrown  up  on  the
     publisher.


     INT: BATHROOM -- NIGHT

     LYDIA  is  just  about  finished with her  make-up  when  CHARLES
     staggers  in,  looking like a man who's just lost both his  lunch
     and his meal-ticket.   From the way LYDIA's nose  crinkles,  it's
     obvious he smells like five pitchers of half-digested Long Island
     iced teas.

                            LYDIA
                       Eeeeoooouuu.  Gross.

     She gets up and goes out.


     INT: HALLWAY -- NIGHT

     LYDIA exits the bathroom just as BEETLE JUICE / DANNY DEATH pulls
     the door of CHARLES's study shut behind him.

                            BEETLE JUICE / DANNY DEATH
                       I've been looking for you.

                            LYDIA
                       You have to meet my family.
                       I've told them all about you.

                            BEETLE JUICE / DANNY DEATH
                       There's plenty of time for that
                       later.

     He pulls LYDIA into her own bedroom and slams the door.


     INT: SCULPTURE BARN -- NIGHT

     DELIA and EVELYN are having words.

                            EVELYN
                       I don't know if I can pull
                       this one out of the fire.
                       Why did you let Charles
                       start drinking like that?

                            DELIA
                       The reason he started
                       drinking today is that he
                       was worried about the IRS
                       man upstairs.  And the
                       reason he's worried about
                       him is because of those
                       tax scams you're always
                       talking him into.

                            EVELYN
                       Those tax <u>shelters</u>
                       allowed him to afford this
                       white elephant of a house
                       you talked him into buying.

                            DELIA
                       It was <u>our</u> idea to move
                       to Connecticut.  And we love
                       living here, and we love
                       this house.  And we both
                       love being a hundred miles
                       away from you.

     We pull back to see a group of about twenty guests,  with glasses
     and  plates of food,  standing in a circle around the two  women,
     not at all trying to disguise their interest and enjoyment in the
     fight.

     OTHO  breaks  through  the circle of spectators,  and  speaks  to
     DELIA.

                            OTHO
                       Everyone is enjoying this
                       immeasurably, Delia, but
                       you've only got half an hour
                       to get ready for your ghosts.
                       I think you'd better make an
                       announcement.

                            EVELYN
                       Your friends in the attic
                       better make this good, or
                       no one will ever accept one
                       of your invitations again.

                            DELIA
                       Eat my shorts, Evelyn.

     OTHO and DELIA go off in close conference.


     INT: LYDIA'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     LYDIA  is  showing BEETLE JUICE / DANNY DEATH the photographs  on
     her wall.   They include the photographs of the ghosts,  and also
     other  macabre subjects.   As they move around the  room,  BEETLE
     JUICE / DANNY DEATH keeps touching LYDIA knowingly,  and  despite
     the sophistication of LYDIA's photographs,  she is a very nervous
     sixteen-year-old girl.

     LYDIA points out a photograph of a mummified corpse.

                            LYDIA
                       I took this series in the
                       catacombs in Guanajuanto.
                       Delia wouldn't even go
                       inside, but I'm not afraid
                       of stuff like that.

     BEETLE JUICE / DANNY DEATH leans over and gives her a kiss on her
     neck.  At the same time, he's pushing her down against her desk.

                            BEETLE JUICE / DANNY DEATH
                       What are you afraid of?

     Just as she's about to be pushed all the way back, LYDIA suddenly
     wriggles out of his grasp, and grabs a large photograph album.

                            LYDIA
                       And these are great, too.


     INT: THE ATTIC -- NIGHT

     ADAM,  CATHY,  and BARBARA have been playing cards.   ADAM is now
     putting up the decks.

                            CATHY
                       I really do have to go
                       downstairs now.

                            BARBARA
                       Stay just a little
                       longer.

                            CATHY
                       I can't.  Anyway, you
                       have to get ready to get
                       down, too.  What are you
                       going to do for the guests?

                            ADAM
                       (Vaguely)  Ah, we thought
                       we'd move some furniture.
                       Knock off people's hats.
                       You know, that kind of thing.

                            CATHY
                       That sounds great.  We
                       were so lucky to move into
                       this house.

     She leaves.  ADAM and BARBARA are not very happy.

                            ADAM
                       What do you think Beetle
                       Juice has in mind?

                            BARBARA
                       I don't know, but he
                       promised not to hurt Cathy.
                       He's just going to scare
                       them enough to drive them
                       out.

     ADAM  and  BARBARA  look at each other.   Both come to  the  same
     conclusion.

                            BARBARA (cont)
                       That means Cathy will go
                       too.  (Beat)  Are you
                       thinking what I'm thinking?

                            ADAM
                       You know I am.  It's been
                       like having a child of our
                       own.  I think we better find
                       Beetle Juice.

                            BARBARA
                       To keep Cathy, I would
                       even put up with Delia
                       Deetz.

                            ADAM
                       I think it'll be fine.
                       All we have to do is tell
                       him we've changed our minds,
                       and that he should go back
                       wherever it was he came
                       from.

     A that moment, though the windows are closed, a CHILL WIND begins
     to blow though the attic.

     BARBARA  and  ADAM look at one another  with  misgiving.   Behind
     them, the pages of the manual begin to flutter wildly.


     INT: LYDIA'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     The  album of photographs lies open on the bed,  displaying  some
     grotesque image.

     BEETLE  JUICE  / DANNY DEATH has LYDIA in a firm embrace  and  is
     dancing her towards the bed.  LYDIA doesn't want to go.

     She hears the NOISE OF THE WIND in the attic above.

                            LYDIA
                       What's that noise?

                            BEETLE JUICE / DANNY DEATH
                       It's just the wind.

                            LYDIA
                       We have to go downstairs
                       now. It's almost time for
                       the ghosts.

                            BEETLE JUICE / DANNY DEATH
                       But I have a little friend
                       I want you to meet first.

     LYDIA is shocked.

                            LYDIA
                       Danny!

     BEETLE  JUICE  / DANNY DEATH releases LYDIA and steps  back.   He
     opens his fur coat, smiling.  His shirt buttons pop, one by one.

     Through this opening wiggles a small,  very much deformed version
     of BEETLE JUICE / DANNY DEATH himself,  attached at the trunk  to
     Danny's chest.   This parasitic monstrosity flops backwards,  and
     hanging upside down, leers and grabs for LYDIA.

     Screaming, LYDIA stumbles for the door.


     EXT: PARK IN MODEL TOWN -- NIGHT

     It's Before the Storm in the model town.   The mechanical  clouds
     swing  crazily  across  the sky.   One of them  comes  loose  and
     crashes  (in a way that clouds don't usually crash) into the city
     hall.  The wind blows mighty and whistling through the town.

     BARBARA  and ADAM are tied to a park bench.   They are  wrestling
     uselessly with their bonds.

                            ADAM
                       I know he's going to
                       do something awful.

                            BARBARA
                       We've got to get loose
                       and find a way to stop
                       him.

                            ADAM
                       I wish we'd never dug
                       up that grave.

     Suddenly,  the hear the CLICK OF NUMEROUS HIGH HEELS on pavement,
     and  in  a moment they are surrounded by Horned Whores of  BEETLE
     JUICE's  brothel.   The  Whores  are wearing  cloth  coats  drawn
     against the wind, and they're carrying small cardboard suitcases.

     They surround the park bench, and stare at ADAM and BARBARA.


     EXT: TENT -- NIGHT

     The  wind,  blowing  hard against the material of the  tent,  has
     driven the guests inside the house.  Inside, the employees of the
     catering service are clearing up.

     CATHY  is walking among the plundered tables with a small  plate.
     She speaks to one of the workers.

                            CATHY
                       What kind of food do
                       squirrels like to eat?


     EXT: MODEL PARK -- NIGHT

     The HALF DOZEN WHORES have released ADAM and BARBARA.   ADAM  and
     BARBARA are massaging their wrists.

                            WHORE #1
                       We're getting out of here,
                       and you better come with us.
                       This whole town's gonna
                       blow.  At midnight.

                            BARBARA
                       Beetle Juice.  I knew it.

                            ADAM
                       What do you mean, this town
                       is going to blow?

                            WHORE #2
                       Beetle Juice is gonna destroy
                       your house, and everything and
                       everybody that's in it -- and
                       that includes Hicksville here.

                            ADAM
                       How do you know this?

                            WHORE #3
                       That's what he always does.
                       He's cute, but he's the most
                       malevolent spirit in the
                       universe.

                            BARBARA
                       But he came here to help
                       us.  We got him through the
                       manual.

     The WHORES roll their eyes at BARBARA and ADAM's naivte.

                            WHORE #4
                       He tricks you.  You were
                       supposed to get Swallowtail.

     A  HONKING HORN sounds,  and a delapidated Greyhound bus pulls up
     in front of the park.

                            WHORE #1
                       That's our bus.  Are you
                       guys coming or not?

     ADAM and BARBARA look at one another.

                            ADAM
                       No.  We have to stay and pro-
                       tect that family downstairs.

     The WHORES pile onto the bus.   They lean out of the windows  and
     wave to ADAM and BARBARA.

                            WHORES
                       Good-bye.  Good luck.
                       etc.

     The bus takes in a cloud of diesel fumes,  turns a corner, and is
     lost to sight.

                            ADAM
                       I don't know how we're
                       going to fight him.
                       We don't even know to get
                       out of the model.

     BARBARA thinks a moment, then looks up the hill to their house.

                            BARBARA
                       I think I know.  Come
                       on.

     She gets up and walks briskly across the grass,  in the direction
     of their home.


     INT: KITCHEN -- NIGHT

     It  looks  wrecked.   The ARTIST from earlier staggers  into  the
     kitchen,  with another victim in tow.   The victim is drunk,  and
     knocks over a glass on the counter.   It smashes it on the floor.
     The ARTIST heads for the laundry room, but when she tries to open
     the  door,  it's  slammed  shut  again,  and  from  inside  comes
     CHARLES's voice.

                            CHARLES (o.s.)
                       It's occupied.


     INT: LAUNDRY ROOM -- NIGHT

     Family conference.   DELIA,  CHARLES,  OTHO, and LYDIA.  DELIA is
     comforting a weeping LYDIA.

                            LYDIA
                       It was horrible.  Oh God,
                       it was the worst thing
                       I've ever seen in my life.

                            CHARLES
                       IRS agents do <u>not</u> punch
                       people in the stomach.  I
                       just know it.

                            OTHO
                       Delia, I looked in the closet
                       upstairs.  It's empty, but
                       there was a gray wig and a
                       flowered dress on the floor.

                            DELIA
                       But I <u>know</u> that woman
                       was dead.

     The family simultaneously come to the same conclusion.

                            LYDIA
                       It's the ghosts.


     INT: CATHY'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     CATHY  is kneeling on the floor at the side of her  bed.   Beside
     her is a plate heaped with fancily-cut raw vegetables.

     She  reaches  beneath  the bed,  and pulls out the box  with  the
     squirrel inside.

                            CATHY
                       Please be all right.

     She opens the lid of the box.

     INSIDE THE BOX --

     is the SQUIRREL FROM HELL.   It is a snarling, foaming beast with
     BEETLE JUICE's COLD YELLOW EYES.

     Before CATHY even has the chance to scream, IT LEAPS.

                                                                CUT:

     INT: LAUNDRY ROOM -- NIGHT

                            DELIA
                       Oh God, you don't they'd
                       hurt Cathy, do you?

                            LYDIA
                       But they like her!

                            CHARLES
                       She's a little girl.

                            LYDIA
                       I'll go look for her.

                            DELIA
                       Are you all right?

                            LYDIA
                       I'm okay.  We have to
                       find Cathy.

     LYDIA leaves.

                            DELIA
                       (To Otho)  How are you
                       on exorcisms?

                            OTHO
                       I know a few things we
                       could try.  But I'd
                       suggest that you get
                       the guests out of here
                       before midnight.


     INT: ATTIC

     Framed  in the attic,  we see the model town bathed in artificial
     moonlight.   The tiny figures of ADAM and BARBARA are silhouetted
     as they cross the bridge.

     CLOSER --

     ADAM  and BARBARA race across the bridge,  and up the  hill  that
     leads them to their house.  The wind is blowing in their faces.

                            ADAM
                       Even if we get there on
                       time, we have no idea how
                       to fight him.


     INT: LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

     CU: DELIA's water clock.  It is five minutes to midnight.

     CHARLES is herding guests into the living room.   DELIA has taken
     up a space on the stairs.

                            DELIA
                       Listen people, I have an
                       announcement to make.

     It's difficult for DELIA to get anyone's attention.

                            DELIA
                       LISTEN!  I'm sorry, but
                       Charles and I are going to
                       have to ask you all to
                       leave.  As quickly as
                       possible.  Believe me, it's
                       for your own good.

                            GUEST #1
                       Delia, this is a very cheap
                       way to build suspense.  Where
                       are the ghosts?


     EXT: MODEL HOUSE -- NIGHT

     BARBARA  and ADAM mount the steps.   The house appears completely
     dark.  ADAM peers in one of the windows.

                            ADAM
                       It's completely dark inside.
                       I don't think this is going
                       to work.

                            BARBARA
                       There's nothing else to do.

     She pulls open the front door, and they step inside.


     INT: LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

     ADAM and BARBARA enter at the back of the crowd of guests,  while
     DELIA continues to try to persuade them all to leave.

                            DELIA
                       See, the two ghosts love this
                       house as much as we do, and
                       they'll to do anything to drive
                       us out.

     Groans from incredulity from the crowd.

                            DELIA
                       Somebody might get hurt.
                       Really.

                            BARBARA
                       They don't know about Beetle
                       Juice.  They think it's us.

     SCREAMS from upstairs.

     DELIA and CHARLES look up in fear.

                            CHARLES
                       That's Lydia.

                            GUEST #2
                       This is getting hokier and
                       hokier.

     LYDIA, full of terror, appears at the top of the stairs.

                            LYDIA
                       Oh God, Delia.  Hurry.
                       It's Cathy.

                            CHARLES #3
                       Is this cheap or what?

     DELIA and CHARLES run upstairs, leaving the grumbling guests.

                            ADAM
                       What has he done to
                       Cathy?

     NEW ANGLE ON THE CROWD OF GUESTS --

     They  are parted like the Red Sea as an unseen ADAM  and  BARBARA
     push through them in order to get upstairs.  For the guests, this
     is  the  first ominous indication that something may actually  be
     very wrong.


     INT: CATHY'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     CATHY  lies on the floor,  torn and bloody,  as if attacked by an
     animal several times her own size.   The wooden box that held the
     Squirrel lies in splinters around her.   DELIA kneels at  CATHY's
     side, applying first aid.  LYDIA runs in with more bandages.

                            CHARLES
                       Cathy!  Cathy!  Wake up.
                       Speak to us.  Tell us what
                       happened.

                            DELIA
                       We know what happened.
                       It was the ghosts.

     CATHY  opens  her eyes a little.   She makes a feeble  motion  of
     shaking her head no.

     Unnoticed by anyone in the room, the bedroom door is pushed open.

                            CATHY
                       They're here.

                            DELIA
                       We know they're here,
                       darling.  And don't worry.
                       Otho's going to tell us
                       how to get rid of them 
                       for good.


     INT: ATTIC -- NIGHT

     Dark and quiet.  The door is pushed slowly open, and OTHO's round
     fat fearful face appears.

                            OTHO
                       Yoo-hoo.

     Getting no response,  OTHO enters the room.  He's brought along a
     bottle of wine for courage.

     He  sees the model town in the moonlight,  and his  curiosity  is
     peaked for a moment.

                            OTHO
                       How quaint.  An exact
                       replica of the dullest
                       town on earth.

     He  continues  his search of the room.   Circling the  model,  he
     trips on something,  leans down,  and retrieves the HANDBOOK  FOR
     THE RECENTLY DECEASED.

                            OTHO
                       Well, this is interesting.
                       I wish there were moon light
                       in here.

     As  if in answer to his wish,  the whorehouse in the  model  town
     bursts  into lurid flame.   OTHO stares at it a moment,  and then
     douses the flames with the wine.


     INT: CATHY'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

     CATHY  has  been moved to the bed,  and looks a little  stronger,
     ADAM  and BARBARA stand on the opposite side of the bed from  the
     DEETZs.   (In  this scene the DEETZs cannot see or hear ADAM  and
     BARBARA.)

                            BARBARA
                       You know we'd never do anything
                       that would hurt you.

                            CATHY
                       I know.

                            CHARLES
                       What, honey?

                            CATHY
                       I know it wasn't Barbara and
                       Adam.  It was an evil spirit.

                            ADAM
                       His name is Beetle Juice.

                            CATHY
                       His name is Beetle Juice.
                       And he's here.

     The clock on her mantle begins to chime midnight.


     INT: LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

     DELIA'S water clock continues to chime the hour.

                            GUEST #4
                       Thank God it's midnight.
                       Now we can go.

                            GUEST #5
                       If Delia has a brain in her
                       head, she'll stay upstairs.

                            GUEST #6
                       It'll be a cold day in hell
                       before I come back to
                       Connecticut.

     The first guests start for the door.   At this moment,  the clock
     stops  chiming.   BEETLE JUICE slides down  the  banister.   He's
     wearing  a  magician's top hat and tails,  looking like  he  last
     worked the Catskills.

                            BEETLE JUICE
                       Pick a card.

     He  fans the TAROT DECK.   No one takes the bait.   He turns over
     the deck.  Every one of the cards is DEATH.

     The GUESTS nearest the door turn away in disgust.

                            GUEST #7
                       Christ, this is what we've
                       been waiting for?

     GUEST #7 pulls open the front door.

     BEETLE JUICE --

     points  at the door.   It slams shut.   GUEST #7,  with his  hand
     still  on  the knob,  is hurtled against  the  door,  and  slumps
     unconscious to the floor.

     BEETLE JUICE smiles at the crowd.

                            BEETLE JUICE
                       Show time.


     EXT: THE HOUSE -- NIGHT

     The wind is picking up,  blowing the trees, pulling the tent pegs
     from  the ground.   The tent whips high into the air.   The  barn
     door is slammed shut by the force of the gale.


     INT: BARN -- NIGHT

     TRIXIE  and ART CRITIC #2 are making out in the shadow of one  of
     DELIA's  monumental sculptures in steel and feathers.   The whole
     barn structure creaks with the force of the wind.

                            TRIXIE
                       Hey, it's midnight.  I
                       want to see Lydia's ghosts.
                       Let's go inside.

                            CRITIC #2
                       Oh, let's stay out here.
                       Delia probably just hired
                       some third-rate magician
                       who's going to --

     AN UNNATURAL GROANING OF METAL --

     interrupts  the  critic.   He and TRIXIE look around  the  dimly-
     lighted barn.

                            TRIXIE
                       What was that?

                            CRITIC #2
                       The wind.

     AN OMINOUS DARK SHADOW --

     crosses the faces of TRIXIE and CRITIC #2.

     They stare at SOMETHING in disbelief.

                            TRIXIE
                       Have you got a car?  A
                       fast car?


     EXT: BARN -- NIGHT

     TRIXIE  and CRITIC #2 bolt from the barn door.   The wind outside
     is even higher than before,  nearly knocking them off their feet.
     We hear that OMINOUS METALLIC CREAK again.  Then --

     ONE OF DELIA'S STEEL AND FEATHER SCULPTURES

     crashes through the barn door, lumbering forward on its sawhorse-
     like legs.

     Another SCULPTURE follows immediately in its wake.


     INT: LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

     The crowd is warily watching as BEETLE JUICE performs a series of
     cheap MAGICIAN's tricks.  He produces a bunch of garishly-colored
     paper  flowers  from his sleeve,  and then pulls a SMALL  SINGING
     CANARY out of his mouth.

     The  WELL-DRESSED MATRON (from earlier) is manifestly anxious  to
     leave.

                            MATRON
                       I really do have to leave.

     BEETLE JUICE smiles at her.   The CANARY perched on his finger is
     suddenly transformed into a small, flying dragon.

     THE  DRAGON leaps at the MATRON,  knocking her out of her  chair,
     and  claws at her exposed face until it is kicked off by  another
     GUEST.

     The DRAGON flies back to BEETLE JUICE,  perching on his top  hat,
     and begins to TWITTER.

                            BEETLE JUICE
                       You'll leave when I tell
                       you to.

     Behind BEETLE JUICE,  we see LYDIA, crouching almost out of sight
     at the top of the stairs leading the second floor.   Her eyes are
     wide, and after a moment, she silently retreats.


     INT: UPSTAIRS HALLWAY -- NIGHT

     OTHO,  carrying  the HANDBOOK,  half runs,  half rolls  down  the
     stairs  from  the  attic.   LYDIA flies down the  hall  from  the
     opposite direction.  The two collide at the door of CATHY's room,
     and do a fat man's dance trying to squeeze through the door.


     INT: CATHY'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     LYDIA and OTHO pop through the door together.

                            OTHO
                       Party's over, people.  There's
                       a demon loose in this house.

                            LYDIA
                       We've got to get out of here.

                            DELIA
                       This is my house.  I'm not
                       leaving.

     CHARLES is standing at the window.  He glances out.

                            CHARLES
                       Holy shit...

                            DELIA
                       What is it?

     CHARLES POV --

     DELIA's  sculptures  are arranged in a circle around  the  house.
     They rock back and forth impatiently on their sawhorse legs.  The
     high wind blows their feathers frantically.

     BACK TO SCENE --

                            OTHO
                       Delia, darling, it's all in
                       here.  (Indicates the Handbook).
                       His name is Swallowtail.

                            CATHY
                       No, it's Beetle juice.

                            LYDIA
                       I don't know what his name
                       is, but he's downstairs right
                       now.  And he just turned a
                       canary into a dragon.

                            DELIA
                       But what does this Bottle
                       Juice want with us?

     CATHY listens a moment to the invisible BARBARA and ADAM.

                            CATHY
                       He's going to destroy this
                       house and kill everybody's 
                       who in it.

                            DELIA
                       Like hell he is.  We're
                       gonna fight.  We paid cash
                       for this house.

                            OTHO
                       I think you've figured out some-
                       thing you can do.  But Cathy os
                       going to have to convince her
                       ghosts to help us.

                            CHARLES
                       Why should they help us?  They've
                       been trying to get rid of us since
                       the day we moved in.

     CATHY listens a moment to the invisible ADAM and BARBARA.

                            CATHY
                       They'll help.  Otho, tell us
                       what to do.


     INT: LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

     The  GUESTS   are  fearful,  and some of the women  are  weeping.
     BEETLE JUICE is still performing his tricks.   He reaches over to
     a  woman,  on the verge of hysteria,  and from her ear pulls  the
     world's  biggest and ugliest catterpillar.   He drops it into her
     drink.

                            BEETLE JUICE
                       Hey, this is a party.  Why
                       isn't anybody having fun?
                       I know.  Let's dance.

     He  looks at the DEETZs sound system.   LOUD ROCK MUSIC comes  on
     instantly.

     For a moment, everyone is still.

                            BEETLE JUICE
                       Dance, I said.

     In  the  far corner of the room,  two guests begin  a  spasmodic,
     frantic dancing.  This continues in a wave across the room, until
     all  the  guests are participating in this physical  insanity  --
     crarshing  off one another,  smashing againt the walls,  some  of
     them  flying  up to the ceiling and hitting  their  heads,  nose-
     diving along the carpets.   BEETLE JUICE, with a wicked laugh and
     cackle, dances amongst them all.

     On the stairway appear,  in this  order,  LYDIA,  DELIA,  CHARLES
     carrying CATHY, and OTHO bringing up the rear.

     BEETLE JUICE looks up at them.  A wicked smile crosses his face.

                            BEETLE JUICE
                       Party's over.

     The MUSIC stops.  The dancers collapse like puppets whose strings
     have been severed.

                            BEETLE JUICE
                       Everybody leave.

     The  windows  all shoot up in their frames,  smashing frames  and
     glass.

     The doors of the house fly open with crashes.


     EXT: HOUSE -- NIGHT

     One  beat,  and  then from every door and  open  window,  frantic
     GUESTS pour out of the house.

     They scatter in all directions in the yard, and chased by DELIA's
     lumbering sculptures, they race towards their cars.

     It is pandemonium.


     INT: LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

     A deadly silence seems to have overtaken the house.

     BEETLE JUICE stands in the middle of the empty living room.

                            BEETLE JUICE
                       I tell you, you guys sure
                       know how to throw a party.

     The DEETZs just look at him.

                            BEETLE JUICE
                       Come closer.  I won't bite.

     CHARLES  looks at OTHO.   OTHO gives him the  go-ahead.   CHARLES
     cautiously comes closer, and puts CATHY in a chair immediately in     
     front of, and facing BEETLE JUICE.

                            CHARLES
                       You don't have to do this.

                            CATHY
                       I do have to.  This house
                       belongs to us.  All of us.

     CHARLES  retreats.   BEETLE JUICE grins.   He sprouts an enormous
     pair  of LEATHER WINGS.   His face alters -- and become  a  truly
     malicious mirror of his twisted soul.

                            BEETLE JUICE
                       Who are you, little girl?
                       And what do you have to
                       say to me?

     CATHY doesn't answer.

                            BEETLE JUICE
                       Where are your friends?
                       Hiding out in the attic, I
                       suppose.  Don't worry about
                       them.  Once I've done with
                       you, I've got a few surprises
                       in store for our ghosts.

                            CATHY
                       As sudden thunder / Pierces night;
                       As magic wonder / Mad affright
                       Rives asunder / Men's delight:
                       Our ghost, our corpse, and we
                         Rise to be.

     CATHY holds out her left hand.

     BARBARA suddenly materializes, holding CATHY's hand.

     DELIA,  CHARLES,  OTHO,  and  LYDIA's  eyes widen to the  fullest
     possible extent.

                            OTHO
                       This is it, Delia.

     OTHO  pushes  DELIA forward,  and BARBARA reaches out  her  hand.
     After a tiny moment's hesitation, DELIA takes it.  She shudders.

                            CATHY
                       As flies the lizard / Serpent fell;
                       As goblin vizard / At the spell
                       Of pale wizard / Sinks to hell;
                       The buried, dead, and slain
                         Rise again.

     CATHY holds out her right hand.   ADAM materializes,  holding it.
     CHARLES is already there,  and grasps ADAM's hand,  after  giving
     him a quick, appraising glance in the face.  Immediately OTHO and
     LYDIA complete the circle around BEETLE JUICE.

                            BEETLE JUICE
                       Clever people.  Who's been
                       reading the manual?  You,
                       fat boy?  I could make you
                       rich and thin.

     OTHO  quivers  a  moment  with  hesitation,  then  he  stands  up
     staunchly.

                            OTHO
                       Delia, I'd better be in
                       your will.

     BEETLE  JUICE flaps his wings,  and a wind begins to blow  inside
     the house, in a clockwise direction.  His seven opponents have to
     strain to keep the circle together.


     EXT: THE HOUSE -- NIGHT

     All the guests have fled.   The sculptures lie in ruin.  The wind
     blows ever harder,  in a counter-clockwise direction,  around the
     house.


     INT: LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

     The wind is even stronger inside the room.   The wind is breaking
     up  the furniture,  and spinning around crazily and  dangerously.
     But the circle remains as if at the eye of a hurricane.

     BEETLE JUICE,  in an uncustomary moment of panic,  throws himself
     at the perimeter of the circle,  but is hurled back by a bolt  of
     colored electricity.  He's burned.

                            BEETLE JUICE
                       I know more tricks than you.
                       Here, girlie, want to see
                       what your friends really
                       look like?

     He grins.

     ADAM and BARBARA shudder in pain,  and at once begin to transform
     into  mouldering  corpses.    Their  clothing  rots,  their  skin
     discolors and peels, mould encrusts their features.

     At  the  same  time,  the lighting in the center  of  the  circle
     continues,  and BEETLE JUICE does a spastic dance trying to avoid
     the charges.  He is burned repeatedly.

     DELIA  and  CHARLES,  finding  that they are holding  hands  with
     corpses, pull away repulsed and horrified.

                            CATHY
                       Don't break the circle.

     CHARLES  and  DELIA screw up their courage,  and  maintain  their
     grips on the corpses' hands.

     The lightning intensifies inside the circle.  Outside the circle,
     the wind is like a hurricane,  and the rest of the living room is
     only a blur.

     CATHY, growing weak, starts to faint.

                            BARBARA CORPSE
                       (Groaning)  Nowwwwww.

     Having said this, BARBARA's jaw falls off.

                            CATHY
                       Today is a thought
                       A fear is tomorrow
                       And yesterday is our sin
                       And our sorrow
                       And life is a death.
                       Dear ghosts, so to die
                       Is to live --
                       And like is a worthless lie,
                       Then we weep for ourselves,
                       and wish you goodbye.

     ADAM  and  BARBARA's corpses turn a  last,  lingering  glance  on
     CATHY.

     BEETLE JUICE screams in frustration and pain.   One last terrific
     bolt  of colored lightning envelops him,  and causes his wings to
     burst  into lurid flame.   He leaps high into the  air,  smashing
     through the ceiling.

     ON THE SECOND FLOOR --

     BEETLE  JUICE,  howling,  crashes  through the  floor,  and  then
     through the ceiling here as well.

     IN THE ATTIC --

     he  crashes  through the attic floor,  and then out  through  the
     roof.


     EXT: THE HOUSE -- NIGHT

     BEETLE  JUICE  is  A BALL OF FIRE at the  top  of  the  whirlwind
     surrounding  the  house.   He explodes like a massive display  of
     fireworks.

     Almost instantly, the wind calms down.


     INT: LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

     The   downstairs   walls  of  the  house  have  been   completely
     obliterated,  leaving only the frame.   There is nothing whatever
     left  of  the furnishings.   Moonlight shines  down  through  the
     vertical holes BEETLE JUICE blasted through the house.

                            CHARLES
                       Is everybody all right?
                       Cathy?

     CATHY has collapsed between two small piles of dust and bones and
     scraps  of cloth,  all that is left of ADAM and  BARBARA.   DELIA
     raises  a  limp CATHY,  and after a tense  moment,  CATHY's  eyes
     struggle open.

                            OTHO
                       There are doors man is not
                       meant to open.  There are
                       places man is not meant to
                       tread.  I guess Connecticut
                       is one of them.

                            LYDIA
                       They gave up their lives
                       to save us and the house.

                            DELIA
                       They were already dead.
                       (Beat)  But you're right,
                       they did sacrifice themselves.

                            CATHY
                       They can't be dead!

     She runs for the stairs.

     OTHO is standing beneath the holes in the ceiling,  looking up at
     the moon.

                            OTHO
                       We could think about a
                       skylight.

     But the DEETZs have already started up the stairs, after CATHY.


     INT: ATTIC -- NIGHT

     In  shadows,  CATHY stands over the model.   Some of it survives,
     some it was sheered off in BEETLE JUICE's ascension.

     LYDIA,  CHARLES, and DELIA come silently into the room, and stand
     together, looking at the miniature version of their own home.

                            CHARLES
                       We have two choices.
                       We can stay and try to
                       put this house together
                       again.  Or we can move
                       back to New York.

     SLOW FADE OUT


     SLOW FADE IN:

     EXT: HOUSE -- DAY

     We hear a CHEERLEADER's voice:

                            LYDIA
                       Two Four Six Eight
                       Winter River's Really Great

     LYDIA  DEETZ is on the front lawn of the house -- now  rempaired,
     but  with  a huge skylight in the middle of the roof.   LYDIA  is
     wearing the WINTER RIVER BADGERS cheerleader uniform, and carries
     two  pompoms.   But she still bears remnants of her DEATH  ROCKER
     make-up, and wears her finger bone necklace.

     In  the  BACK YARD of the house,  CHARLES DEETZ  is  tending  the
     replanted orchard.   At the same time,  he is dictating the fifth
     in a series of occult novels, into a Walkman-like dictaphone.

                            CHARLES
                       Aghast, I turned to look into
                       his face.  His features had
                       begun to melt.  He was turning
                       into a corpse before my stunned
                       but courageous eyes...


     INT: LIVING ROOM -- DAY

     Repaired,  and now decorated by someone with much more taste than
     OTHO.   But the water clock, in an improved and expanded version,
     still holds forth.

     CATHY's on her way upstairs carrying a glass of iced tea.


     INT: SECOND FLOOR SEWING ROOM -- DAY

     The 80's equivalent of BARBARA's sewing room.  DELIA is at a work
     bench,  hard  at  work on some extremely small  object,  using  a
     magnifying glass, and a mini-acetylene torch.

     CATHY comes in with the iced tea.

                            CATHY
                       You wanted lemon in your
                       tea, didn't you?

                            DELIA
                       Yes.  Thank you dear.
                       Voila.  It's done.  You
                       can take it upstairs.

                            CATHY
                       (A little uncertainly)
                       Great.


     INT: ATTIC -- DAY

     The  model  town  is in the process of  being  repaired.   It  is
     apparent that this is now CATHY's bedroom.

     CATHY  takes the small object that DELIA gave her,  and takes  it
     over  to  the  model.   With a pair of jewelry  pliers  she  very
     carefully sets it on the front porch of the MAITLAND's home.

     We get a look at it now,  and it's a miniature version of DELIA's
     water clock.


     EXT: MODEL HOUSE -- DAY

     ADAM  and BARBARA come out of the front door,  and stare  at  the
     water clock.  They look up at CATHY.

                            CATHY
                       Mom made it for you.

     BARBARA starts to say something, but ADAM interrupts her.

                            ADAM
                       Tell Delia thank you.  What
                       a wonderful surprise.

                            CATHY
                       She wants to know if you'll
                       need any help placing it.

                            BARBARA
                       Tell her we know just what
                       to do with it.

     ADAM and BARBARA go inside the house.


     INT: MODEL HOUSE LIVING ROOM -- DAY

     It's just like ADAM and BARBARA's house was in the first scene.

                            ADAM
                       I know it's just a model
                       house, and I know we're
                       ghosts, and we're never
                       going anywhere else for a
                       hundred and thirty-two
                       years -- but I still think
                       it's heaven.

     He  closes  the door,  and after a moment,  there is  an  ominous
     vibration.  The WATER CLOCK smashes through the window.

                            BARBARA
                       Well, it'll have to do until
                       something better comes along.


                                    END
