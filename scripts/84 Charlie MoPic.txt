                                      SHOOTING DRAFT

                

               LIEUTENANT DREWRY -- EL TEE

               Bright green, brand new issue tropical fatigues, boots, M-
               16, and .45 pistol. Just out of Officer Candidate School. 
               Crewcut, clean face, ambitious and full of the wrong ideas. 
               24 years old.

               SERGEANT O'DONIGAN -- OD

               Well-faded tiger fatigues, scuffed boots, a lot of trail 
               behind him. A black man from a large family, takes care of 
               his team. Carries a CAR-15, carbine model of the M-16, and a 
               Model 70 Winchester bolt action sniper rifle with scope, 
               both with long black muzzle flash suppressors. A natural 
               leader. An intensely serious man on the job, his rare smile 
               dazzles. OD is 21.

               SPEC/5 -- CRACKER

               Spotted camouflage fatigues, worn and faded. He never tans, 
               just gets red. Trace of a Southern accent and an old man's 
               eyes. Defers to OD. Carries a 12-gauge riot shotgun with 
               bandolier, and an M-14 sniper rifle with scope and flash 
               suppressor. Dry wit, likes to watch the interplay between 
               the others and wait for his opening. He is 24, but looks 
               older.

               SPEC/4 BALDWIN -- PRETTY BOY

               Handsome, all-American, clean cut, easy going, he keeps the 
               peace between Easy and Hammer. His tiger fatigues look 
               tailored. Carries an M-79 grenade launcher with two bandoliers 
               of grenades. Quick to smile, Easy's best friend and audience. 
               Pretty Boy is 20.

               SPEC/4 THORPE -- HAMMER

               Short, stocky, Fu Manchu mustache, too-small tiger fatigues 
               accented with black t-shirt and black leather gloves with 
               the fingers cut off. Swaggering macho style, carries his M-
               60 machine gun like he's seen too many John Wayne movies. 
               Half immature teenager, half warrior, he is jealous of the 
               affection shown toward Easy. He is 19.

               PRIVATE EASELY -- EASY

               Skinny, homely, his tiger fatigues look baggy. He carries 
               the PRC-25 radio and M-1 carbine. Walks with a bounce, even 
               in the jungle, and talks like an urban, rock and roll speed 
               freak. Takes nothing seriously, least of all himself. Loves 
               Pretty Boy, admires OD, teases Hammer because he's an easy 
               target. He's been in the war too long and he is now getting 
               scared. Easy is 21.

                

               VIETNAM - The Central Highlands - 1968

               The CAMERA STARTS and focuses on the ground where the words --

               -- have been scratched.

               An M-16 bayonet is jabbed into the ground next to the letters. 
               The lettering goes fuzzy then sharp, fuzzy then sharp, as 
               the Cameraman focuses.

               A hand reaches in and pulls the bayonet out of the ground.

               The Camera pulls back and focuses on LIEUTENANT DREWRY. He 
               sheaths the bayonet and turns on the tape recorder that is 
               next to his rucksack. He fiddles with the dials and looks at 
               the Camera.

               Sound on.

                                     DREWRY
                         ...turns this thing on? How do you 
                         tell if it's working? Outstanding.

               They stand outside a large tent with a sign in front of it -- 
               "S-2/S-3". A soldier whitewashes a line of rocks that form a 
               square in front of the tent. Further away a soldier casually 
               guards four Vietnamese who are filling sandbags. Music plays 
               in one of the tents.

               The Camera catches everything, including the rise of ground 
               in front of the tent, the helicopter pad.

               Drewry finishes a cigarette as he tries to tighten the straps 
               on his pack. The Camera dwells on Drewry as he puts out the 
               cigarette on the heel of one shiny new boot, field strips 
               the butt and scatters the tobacco, balls up the paper and 
               pockets it and the filter. He is nervous.

               He stands and faces the Camera, adjusts his gig line and 
               tries to look serious.

                                     DREWRY
                         Ah... Drewry, Richard B., First 
                         Lieutenant... Headquarters and 
                         Headquarters Company, 173rd Airborne 
                         Brigade... Vietnam.

                         Lessons Learned Project, DASPO.

               He pauses a moment and thinks.

                                     CAMERAMAN (O.S.)
                         Mission.

                                     DREWRY
                         Reconnaissance mission, Central 
                         Highlands. Our goal is to record 
                         procedures peculiar to this combat 
                         situation. Uh...

               The fluttering of a distant helicopter is heard. It gets 
               louder. Drewry looks into the sky and finds the helicopter.

                                     DREWRY
                         That must be ours.

               The Camera finds the helicopter, a Huey. It descends toward 
               the pad where a soldier helps it land, using hand signals.

               The blades kick up a huge cloud of dust.

               Through the dust walks the team with OD in the lead. Packs 
               on their backs, weapons in hand.

               The Huey engine idles, the whoop-whoosh of the blades a slow, 
               steady beat.

               OD halts the team and Easy gooses HAMMER with his thumb. 
               Hammer just grins.

                                     HAMMER
                         Damn, Easy, you got a cold nose.

               Drewry walks over to the team.

                                     DREWRY
                         Which one of you is Sergeant 
                         O'Donigan?

                                     OD
                         Yo, sir.

               The men play for the Camera. Easy cranks up a middle finger. 
               Pretty Boy waves, "Hi, Mom". Hammer pretends to jack off. 
               Cracker gurns. OD tries to ignore the Camera, but he is wary.

                                     DREWRY
                         Glad to be working with you, Sergeant. 
                         I'm your new Officer in Charge. Major 
                         Nolin has briefed me on the mission. 
                         We're prepared to move out.

               OD looks at Drewry in surprise. He looks at the Cameraman, 
               then back to Drewry. The team is stunned.

                                     OD
                         We'll see about that.

               Angrily he drops his pack and weapons and strides into the S-
               2 tent. Nonplussed, Drewry hesitates, then follows.

               The rest of the team look at the Cameraman.

                                     EASY
                         TV news?

                                     CAMERAMAN (O.S.)
                         Army. How about a roll call?

                                     EASY
                         Easely, Private E-2! Soon to be 
                         promoted to PFC... Private Fucking 
                         Civilian! 27 days and a wake up! I'm 
                         short, sir!

                                     HAMMER/PRETTY BOY/CRACKER
                         How short are you?

                                     EASY
                         I'm so short I can parachute off a 
                         dime, sir!

               Easy gives a half-assed salute.

               The Camera focuses on Pretty Boy.

                                     PRETTY BOY
                         Spec 4 Baldwin, San Bernardino, 
                         California.

               He straightens his hair and just stands there.

                                     CAMERAMAN (O.S.)
                         Don't look at me, look at the camera.
                              (beat)
                         Say something.

                                     PRETTY BOY
                         Something.

               Easy grabs the microphone from the Cameraman.

                                     EASY
                         Testes, testes, one, two.

                                     HAMMER
                         "Jingle bells, mortar shells...

                                     HAMMER/EASY
                         ...VC in the grass...

                                     TEAM
                         ...You can take your Merry Christmas 
                         and stick it up your...

               They all laugh.

               The Camera moves in on Hammer. He steps forward, at stiff 
               attention.

                                     HAMMER
                         Thorpe, William. Specialist 4th Class. 
                         US 16-848-107. Machine gunner.

                                     EASY
                         What a lifer.

                                     HAMMER
                         Put a liplock on my love muscle, 
                         Easy.

                                     EASY
                         Let me fuck you in the ear so you 
                         can hear me coming.

                                     CRACKER
                         I think they're in love.

                                     EASY
                         We are, we're engaged.

               Easy leaps on Hammer and sticks his tongue in his ear.

                                     HAMMER
                         That's disgusting, man.

               Easy tries to kiss Hammer. Pretty Boy, and Cracker join the 
               pile up on Hammer. They roll in the dirt.

               The Cameraman singles out Cracker, who is a little worried.

                                     CAMERAMAN (O.S.)
                         You want to sound off?

                                     CRACKER
                         Uh, right. Spec 5 Frye, weapons 
                         specialist. I'm hare-lipped, hump-
                         backed and half crazy. Not responsible 
                         for my own actions.

               Hammer stands behind Cracker and gives him horns. Easy puts 
               a wet finger in his ear, and Pretty Boy raises a clenched 
               fist between Cracker's legs.

               Cracker ignores them.

               OD and Drewry walk out of the tent accompanied by Major Nolin.

               OD is looking grim. Drewry salutes Nolin.

                                     OD
                              (to team)
                         Let's get our shit together. We got 
                         a mission.

               The team grab their gear and walk toward the helicopter. 
               Easy takes off his soft cap and puts on his steel helmet.

               The Cameraman moves in on OD.

                                     CAMERAMAN (O.S.)
                         How about your name and rank? Don't 
                         look at me, look at the camera.

                                     OD
                         I'm not talking to the camera, I'm 
                         telling you. Get that thing out of 
                         my face.

               OD shoulders his gear. Cracker hands him his weapons and 
               looks at OD with a question in his eyes. OD shakes his head.

               The team boards the Huey easily, they've done it a thousand 
               times, a casual ride in the country. Drewry and the Cameraman 
               wait to board last.

               Drewry looks at OD. OD glares at him.

               The Cameraman is helped in and he catches a shot of the S-2 
               tent. Major Nolin watches the chopper.

               The engine revs and the Huey lifts.

               BLACK. Sound off.

               STOCK FOOTAGE -- Vietnam countryside from the helicopter 
               P.O.V., passing over a fire base.

               CAMERA ON.

               Hammer tries to talk with the door gunner. Easy blows into 
               his thumb, inflating his middle finger. Pretty Boy sleeps. 
               The Camera focuses on Easy, who looks nervous, but tries to 
               cover it.

               The Camera turns and catches a view of the jungle below. 
               Rice paddies, peasants working, water buffalo.

               STOCK FOOTAGE -- The Central Highlands, mountains, triple 
               canopy jungle.

               BLACK.

               The CAMERA STARTS as the helicopter hits the ground. Sound 
               on.

               Cracker and Hammer drop first and wait for the rest of the 
               men to clear the helicopter. The wind from the helicopter 
               blades beats the brush with hard rhythm.

               The men run through the brush, OD in the lead, followed by 
               Pretty Boy, Easy, Drewry and the Cameraman. The sounds of 
               the helicopter fade as it flies away off screen.

               Drewry's rucksack and harness rattle and clatter, flopping 
               loosely on his back, straps flying.

               The Cameraman turns and kneels to capture Cracker and Hammer 
               pulling up the rear. They run past him. The Cameraman gets 
               to his feet and follows. Cracker stops for a second and grabs 
               the Cameraman by the shoulder and shoves him ahead.

                                     CRACKER
                         Move your ass, troop.

               The Cameraman runs on. Branches whip at the lens as it breaks 
               through the dense brush. Sometimes the branches obliterate 
               the picture completely for a second.

               The Cameraman loses sight of Hammer and he tries to catch 
               up. The Cameraman suddenly reaches Hammer and the others 
               stopped behind some brush at the edge of a clearing ten to 
               fifteen meters across.

               OD crosses the clearing, running in a low crouch. Easy is on 
               the alert, watching intently as OD disappears into the brush 
               on the other side of the clearing. Cracker and Hammer watch 
               the flanks, Pretty Boy the rear.

               Drewry sits on the ground huffing and puffing. He's not used 
               to this.

                                     DREWRY
                         How long... we gotta... run?

                                     PRETTY BOY
                         This is Indian country, sir. Dime to 
                         a dollar, Chuck saw or heard that 
                         chopper. He don't figure the pilot 
                         stopped to take a piss. Best to put 
                         some klicks between the LZ and us. 
                         Can you dig it?

               Pretty Boy doesn't look at Drewry, he watches the jungle 
               behind them.

               OD comes into sight on the other side of the clearing, his 
               fist pumping in the air.

                                     EASY
                         Clear.

               Easy runs across the clearing. He makes it safely. Hammer 
               goes next.

               Pretty Boy hits the top of Drewry's helmet.

                                     PRETTY BOY
                         Quick, like a bunny fucks.

               Drewry takes a deep breath and runs across the clearing. 
               Pretty Boy follows.

               Cracker covers the rear.

                                     CRACKER
                              (to Cameraman)
                         Your turn in the barrel. Go.

               The Cameraman runs across the clearing.

               The team is clustered together, each man facing a different 
               direction, alert. Drewry adjusts his pack straps. The 
               Cameraman turns and catches Cracker crossing the clearing, 
               then he tries to focus on the entire team.

               They are gone. All the Cameraman catches is Pretty Boy's 
               back disappearing into the jungle.

               The Cameraman runs after them. He trips and almost falls, 
               but runs on. Branches blind his lens.

               More busting brush, just keeping Pretty Boy's back in sight.

               The Camera explodes into a small circular clearing, an open 
               pocket in the jungle growth.

               Drewry has fallen into a sweaty heap.

               Hammer and Pretty Boy stand on alert.

               Easy and OD crouch together. Easy is on the radio.

               The Cameraman sits.

               OD looks at the Cameraman and Drewry in disgust.

                                     OD

                         this load-bearing equipment.

               Pretty Boy gets another roll of olive drab duct tape from 
               his pack and begins to tape down and tighten the loose straps 
               on Drewry's pack. Drewry helps where he can.

               In the background, OD and Cracker consult the map and their 
               compass.

               Drewry has two grenades hooked to his harness suspenders. 
               Pretty Boy unhooks them and puts them into a pouch.

                         is blow yourself away, El Tee. A 
                         chest wound is nature's way of saying 
                         you fucked up.

                                     DREWRY
                         What I heard, they had a man assigned 
                         to you from one of the line units, 
                         but his chopper crashed. So they 
                         grabbed me.

               OD looks at Drewry and shakes his head. Pretty Boy unclips 
               one of Drewry's dog tags and hooks it behind his boot laces.

                         I used to handle "grip and grins", 
                         award ceremonies, change of command, 
                         stuff like that...

               Hammer starts to smile at the Cameraman, but he suddenly 
               hears something and freezes. Everyone but Drewry and the 
               Cameraman also freeze. Hammer is at the center, tense, braced 
               to fire, machine gun at the ready.

               Easy slowly, noiselessly picks up his M-1 carbine and eases 
               the safety off. Pretty Boy looks around the brush. OD creeps 
               over to Hammer. Cracker is scanning the jungle on the other 
               flank.

                                     DREWRY
                         What...?

               OD's CAR is instantly at Drewry's forehead. Their eyes meet. 
               OD is hard, warning him to be quiet. Drewry looks at the 
               Camera, then away, embarrassed.

               OD watches Hammer. Easy watches OD. Cracker and Pretty Boy 
               scan the jungle.

               Hammer relaxes and grins foolishly.

                                     HAMMER
                         Fuck-you-lizard.

                         Let's saddle up.

               Everyone gets ready to move out. Drewry glares at OD, anger 
               taking the place of his initial fear.

               Cracker walks over to the Cameraman.

               The Cameraman lowers the Camera to pick up his pack.

               CAMERA ON.

               The team is stopped, guns outboard. OD is getting a compass 
               reading. Drewry walks over to OD followed by the Cameraman.

                         I won't let anything like that happen 
                         again. You point a gun at me again 
                         and I'll have you up in front of a 
                         court martial.

                         the rear no more. In order to have a 
                         court martial you need more than one 
                         officer. I don't see anyone with 
                         brass, but you. Out here the bush is 
                         the boss.

               The team remains on guard, but takes in every word of the 
               confrontation.

                                     DREWRY

                         Charlie's game, his rules. We learned 
                         how to play it, that's why we're out 
                         here.

                                     DREWRY
                         And that's why I'm here.
                              (indicating Camera)
                         And why he's here. To take back some 
                         of that training.
                              (beat)
                         I'm ready to learn, but not at 
                         gunpoint.

               OD pauses. Drewry has made a peace offering.

                                     OD
                         All right. Pay attention, El Tee, 
                         we'll teach you. But we don't grade 
                         on a curve, it's pass or fail. I 
                         have to point my gun at you again 
                         I'll pull the fucking trigger.

               OD starts off into the jungle.

               Easy is rummaging through the Cameraman's pack.

               Pretty Boy is preparing food.

               Hammer is leaning against a tree, wary and on guard. OD and 
               Cracker aren't to be seen, just their rifles against a tree.

               The team is stopped on a slope halfway up a hillside.

               Pretty Boy giggles.

               Easy slices the bread lengthwise, puts jam on both halves, 
               water on the top and heats it over a fire he's made from a

                         of shit.

               Easy makes himself a cup of hot chocolate using two packs. 
               Pretty Boy fixes pre-sweetened Kool-Aid. They both heat canned 
               rations over their own fires.

                         One tough dude.

               Drewry eats his food cold. Pretty Boy feeds his fire with 
               more pieces of C-4.

                         slack for us. We're all brothers.

               Pretty Boy finishes eating and takes Hammer's place on guard. 
               Hammer crouches over the fire and fixes food for two.

               There is some real antagonism between Hammer and Easy that 
               underlies the joking. Drewry is uncomfortable.

               Easy looks up. Cracker and OD have reappeared as if from 
               nowhere.

               Cracker walks over to Hammer and takes some of the food. OD 
               spots the plastic bag of grass sticking out of Easy's pocket 
               and he pulls it out.

               Drewry pulls a pack of cigarettes from his pocket. Before he 
               can get one out of the pack Cracker grabs them out of his 
               hand, digs a hole in the ground with his heel and buries 
               them.

                         But...

                                     OD
                         Our primary mission is recon, sir. 
                         Let's move out.

               The team moves out.

               BLACK. Sound off.

               Sound on.

                                     PRETTY BOY (V.O.)
                         I love the sunset in Nam.

                                     DREWRY (V.O.)
                         It's gorgeous.

               CAMERA ON.

               Sunset.

               Drewry and the Cameraman watch Pretty Boy string trip wires 
               around their camp. He uses the ration cans he stuffed in his 
               socks earlier. He drops a couple pebbles in each can and 
               hooks them to the wire and tests the rattle, then camouflages 
               everything.

                                     PRETTY BOY
                         Fuck "gorgeous", it means the day's 
                         almost over and I'm one day shorter. 
                         I hate this fucking place. They ought 
                         to DX the whole fucking country, 
                         north and south. Turn it in to the 
                         big quartermaster in the sky. Say, 
                         "Hey, motherfucker, this place is 
                         beyond repair."

                                     DREWRY
                         It looks pretty some times.

                                     PRETTY BOY
                         You should have seen it when I first 
                         came over. You could still see tigers 
                         and elephants on the Ho Chi Minh 
                         Trail. Fucking elephants.

               Pretty Boy shakes his head in disbelief.

               They walk back to the main camp area on a steep slope. Drewry 
               stumbles.

                                     PRETTY BOY
                         We night camp on a slope, away from 
                         the trail. Even Chuck sticks to the 
                         trails at night, so he ain't likely 
                         to trip over us.

               Hammer is boiling water in his canteen cup. Easy is monitoring 
               the radio. Cracker is on guard. OD is opening a pack of Lurp 
               rations.

                                     PRETTY BOY

                         Water's boiling.

               OD tosses two Lurps to Drewry.

                         Spaghetti and chili.

               Everyone gathers around Hammer with their Lurps. He pours 
               water into the plastic bags.

               OD has him fill two and he gives one to Cracker.

                         Number one chop chop.

               Hammer boils more water for coffee and cocoa.

                         First guard, Cracker, Hammer, me, 
                         then Pretty Boy and Easy.

                         I don't know you.

               Drewry and OD stare at each other for a moment. Drewry wants 
               to make something of the rejection.

                                     OD
                         You're not used to humping, you're 
                         beat. You'll need the sack time.

               Drewry accepts the conciliatory gesture.

                         MoPic's got a can of fruit cocktail 
                         and one of peaches that I saved.

                         training for him. Hey, MoPic, souvenir 
                         me your pack.

                                     OD
                         Peaches and fruit cocktail all around.

               The Cameraman tosses Easy his pack, but before Easy can look 
               for the canned fruit, something calls him back to his radio. 
               He hears something through the static.

               Easy holds the handset to his ear and listens intently. Pretty 
               Boy gets the cans of fruit from the Cameraman's pack.

                         Monsoon season. A rat fuck.

               Pretty Boy opens the canned fruit. He takes a spoonful of 
               fruit cocktail and passes the can to Hammer.

                                     PRETTY BOY
                         Save a cherry for Easy.

               Pretty Boy slurps up a peach slice and hands that can to OD. 
               Each man takes his share and passes it along.

                         Not too shabby.

               OD starts eating his Lurp ration, a sign for the others to 
               start. Easy and the Cameraman are the only ones not eating.

               The Camera starts to lower, but catches Easy taking two pills 
               from a ziploc bag and swallowing them. No one but the Camera 
               sees it. Easy sees the Camera on him.

               The Camera reacts.

               Hammer knows a sucker when he sees one.

                         your life in the Nam.

               Pretty Boy can't take it anymore, he bursts out laughing.

               Drewry snaps his fingers in front of the Camera.

               It is dark and the men are gathered around inside their night 
               perimeter. Easy fiddles with the radio. The others prepare 
               their sleeping areas.

               Drewry approaches OD.

                                     DREWRY
                         We need to do some background

                         we'd start with you.

                         the Army? Background stuff.

               OD glares at the Cameraman.

                         Army's got no business in my private 
                         life.

               The Camera holds a tenuous moment and then focuses on Drewry, 
               who wonders whether to push it.

               Drewry decides to drop it and he shifts his attention to 
               Cracker.

                                     DREWRY

               Drewry looks at the other members of the team and fixes on 
               Easy. Easy is smiling at him. Drewry walks over to Easy with 
               the Cameraman.

                         Night's the worst. I hate the night 
                         like a motherfucker. Trees walk at 
                         night if you stare at them long 
                         enough. The Nam's a motherfucker if 
                         you got any imagination.

               CAMERA ON.

               Morning. The Cameraman follows OD across the camp. OD and 
               the Camera stop next to Drewry, who is heating water in two 
               canteen cups. Drewry slips on his boots and turns on the 
               recorder.

               Sound on.

                         you put 'em on. All sorts of nasty 
                         critters love to crawl in your boots 
                         at night.

               Drewry looks at his feet, stands up and stamps them.

                                     DREWRY
                         I've heated water for coffee or cocoa 
                         for everyone.

                         Figured it's better than riding free.

               OD nods, smiles, and leads Drewry and the Cameraman over to 
               Cracker.

               Cracker is still asleep. Pretty Boy is awake, but still laying 
               down. He rolls over to watch.

               Hammer is brushing his teeth. Easy is on watch, his rifle in 
               his lap, radio at his side.

               OD stops next to Cracker and strikes a lecturer's pose.

                         to encounter the enemy.

               OD brandishes a long stick. Cracker sleeps soundly, his mouth 
               open.

                         detection devices. You don't have 
                         time to wake up, stand and wander 
                         around with your dick in your hands 
                         looking for your weapon. The enemy 
                         is ten yards away ready to waste 
                         your ass.

                         So you train yourself to wake with a 
                         rolling motion, providing the enemy 
                         with a low silhouette and, thusly, a 
                         minimal target. You sleep with your 
                         weapon in the same position every 
                         night, to the right or left of you 
                         depending on your preference, so 
                         when the shit hits...

               WHAP! OD whacks Cracker with the stick.

                                     OD
                         BOOM!

               Cracker rolls to his right, picks up his shotgun in mid-roll 
               and lands on hs stomach, sighting down the barrel and clicking 
               off the safety.

                         position, ready to engage the enemy.

               Everyone claps and laughs. Cracker looks pissed as he wakes 
               more and gets up slowly.

                                     CRACKER

                         shit you can imagine, and a lot you 
                         can't. I was Medevaced three times 
                         when they thought I was dead. Once 
                         they even zipped me into a body bag. 
                         We'd get hit, you know, and I'd be 
                         in a hole with three other guys. A 
                         mortar round would come right in the

                         nose, blood all over me, not all 
                         mine... The medics would figure I 
                         was dead and throw me on the chopper 
                         with the bodies. No fun waking up

               OD indicates a dead branch, then a wire. He follows the wire 
               with his fingers into the brush. There is a Chinese Communist 
               grenade tied to a stick with the wire in the pull string.

               OD stops at the side of the trail and pulls the brush aside. 
               There are pointed bamboo stakes with barbs planted in the 
               earth.

               The team is moving through the jungle at a good pace, but as 
               quietly as possible. There is heavy breathing, branches 
               slapping at the men, a muted rattle of equipment. The brush 
               is dense, visibility no more than five meters.

               The team halts.

               OD raises his hand and dives to the ground. The others hit 
               the ground after him. The Cameraman crouches.

               Drewry raises up to look around. Hammer pushes him back to 
               the ground, hard. Drewry gasps, then mews with pain.

               Someone pushes the Cameraman down and the lens hits the dirt.

               BLACK.

               Fast, heavy breathing from Drewry.

               Footsteps and the swish of brush as something else moves 
               through the jungle nearby.

               The Camera is raised and set horizontal. Feet in Ho Chi Minh 
               sandals walk by. Low Vietnamese voices. Drewry's prone body 
               is in view. A bamboo stake pierces his forearm. His face is 
               tense with pain.

               Drewry's breathing seems to get louder.

               A pair of feet stop a few feet from Drewry. Drewry holds his 
               breath. Louder Vietnamese voices.

               A stream of yellow water trickles to the ground as the NVA 
               soldier pisses. He moves on.

               Drewry's breath rushes out.

               The noise fades as the soldiers move out of the area.

               Soundlessly, the team rises and continued along the trail, 
               faster and quieter in a low crouch.

               Drewry clutches his forearm.

               BLACK. Sound off.

               Sound on.

               CAMERA ON.

               Rest stop. Pretty Boy is bandaging Drewry's arm. Hammer and 
               Cracker are on guard. Easy moves with nervous energy.

                         I'm too short for this shit.

               Pretty Boy uses a Kotex to cover the wound. Drewry looks at 
               it curiously.

                                     PRETTY BOY

               Drewry looks down at the bandage. He pops two, then four 
               Tetracycline tablets.

                         a bad name.

               There is a noise so slight it's almost indistinguishable. 
               The team grab their guns and face outward. Cracker calls out 
               quietly.

               OD appears quietly out of the jungle. The team relaxes.

               The argument is starting to get serious. Hammer smacks Easy's

               Everyone shuts up.

               BLACK. Sound off.

               CAMERA ON. Sound on.

               The team moves through the jungle, slower, more cautiously. 
               Drewry is traveling with less effort and he is quiet.

               The men are beginning to move as a unit again.

               BLACK. Sound off.

               CAMERA ON. Sound on.

               The men are extremely alert. OD and Cracker aren't with them.

                         South Carolina. Up north they call 
                         us hillbillies, but we ain't. 
                         Dictionary defines hillbilly as a 
                         Michigan farmer. We're white trash, 
                         dirt poor, big family. I got four 
                         kids myself, two boys, two girls 
                         last time I checked.

                         The Army helps a poor man pull himself 
                         up. Feeds my family, good retirement, 
                         gives me an education. I got my GED. 
                         Black people, Puerto Ricans who don't 
                         even speak English, Army's the only 
                         equal opportunity employer I ever 
                         saw. I could get to be First Sergeant, 
                         even a Warrant Officer. Good money.

                         You figure what you're doing here is 
                         right?

                                     CRACKER
                         I don't figure right or wrong about 
                         it. People like me go day to day, 
                         spend our time figuring how to get 
                         food on the table.

                         My daddy was the best cabinetmaker 
                         you ever saw. Didn't get a lot of 
                         work 'cause of his hands, arthritis 
                         twisted them up, but whenever he 
                         made something, a cabinet, a three-
                         legged stool, it was the best goddamn 
                         three-legged stool he could make. He 
                         taught the same to me. You do your 
                         job the best you can, no matter you 
                         like it or not.

                         Once he made a black oak china 
                         cabinet, black oak, and when the 
                         lady said he should paint it white 
                         to match her floorboard trim, well, 
                         my daddy painted it white. Beautiful 
                         black oak, grain like running water. 
                         He painted it the smoothest, cleanest 
                         white you ever saw. Milk ain't that 
                         white.

                         You do your job, let the right or 
                         wrong to others. You earn your pay. 
                         OD feels the same. That's why me and 
                         OD are this close.

               Cracker holds up two fingers horizontally, one on top of the 
               other.

                                     CRACKER
                         That's me on top.

                                     DREWRY
                         Being from South Carolina, how does 
                         it feel, being led by a black man?

               Cracker's eyes narrow.

                                     CRACKER
                         We don't ask those questions out 
                         here, that's a Real World question. 
                         Ask me that in South Carolina. Right 
                         now ask me if OD isn't the best 
                         fucking boonie rat I ever met. Ask 
                         me if OD ain't the best human being 
                         I ever humped a ruck with. Ask me if 
                         I love him like a brother and if I'd 
                         kill for him. I do and I have. If 
                         I'd lay my life on the line for him... 
                         I have. And if he ain't done the 
                         same for me.

                         We're finished here.

               Cracker gets up and walks away.

               Drewry sees the Camera on him. He looks away, embarrassed.

                                     DREWRY
                         Turn that fucking thing off.

                         Before it gets dark you lay in your 
                         position, check out your fire lanes, 
                         and most of all you memorize the 
                         terrain in front of you.

               CAMERA ON.

               Easy lies on the ground and looks into the night. He talks 
               nervously.

                         Every tree, bush, and rock. Sometimes 
                         you draw a picture in the dirt in 
                         front of you. Then at night, those 
                         shadows, you know what they are. 
                         They're not the bad guys, you know?
                              (laughing nervously)
                         But then you think, the little dink 
                         fucker replaced the bush with himself. 
                         You know it moved, you know it did.

                         crawling gook, don't it? Freaky shit. 
                         Stare at it long enough, it'll move, 
                         I wouldn't shit you.

               Pretty Boy appears and lays a hand on Easy's shoulder.

                                     PRETTY BOY
                         Hey, Breeze, what does the Jolly

               They both laugh. The laughter fades and they stare out into 
               the darkness.

               BLACK. Sound off.

               CAMERA ON. Sound on.

               Easy grins into the Camera. He motions to the Cameraman to 
               follow him. Easy picks up Drewry's Nagra and walks across 
               the camp.

               It is dark. There is some fog. OD is cleaning his long rifle. 
               Easy fiddles with the Nagra's knobs.

               Easy and the Cameraman walk over to Drewry. Easy points the 
               microphone at him. Drewry looks worried.

                         Active? Close to two years. I was 
                         National Guard in college. Wanted

                         So, El Tee, why you being such a

                         No, it's a fair question. I think 
                         you people treat the war like some 
                         game. You dress up like GI Joe or

                         like Cracker said. You can be a peon, 
                         or, if you see yourself as executive 
                         material, the advancement potential 
                         is enormous.

               Cracker, on guard, turns and looks at the other men.

                         play it right, I can leave Nam as a

                         a line unit I'm just another shavetail 
                         lieutenant. My only chance was if we 
                         got hit bad and I pulled it through. 
                         But there were too many people above 
                         me making the decisions and they'd 
                         take the credit.

               There is a moment of silence.

               Night. The team is sleeping. Pretty Boy is on guard. OD sits 
               near him.

               They talk softly, unaware of the Camera.

                         There it is.

               Easy starts in his sleep. Pretty Boy and OD look at him in 
               concern. Easy settles down.

                                     PRETTY BOY
                         You know, OD, I can't handle much 
                         more of this. My shit's getting flaky.

                         Just one more time. So you just roll 
                         your shit up into a tight little 
                         ball and flick it in Charlie's eyes.

               OD notices the Camera and looks at it with surprise, offended 
               at the intrusion. He gives the Cameraman the evil eye.

               CAMERA ON. Sound on.

               Dawn at the camp. The Camera is shaky and out of focus. It 
               centers on a new man, the Cameraman, leaning against a tree 
               and taking a leak.

                                     HAMMER (O.S.)
                         Okay, MoPic, don't piss on me, piss 
                         on the camera.

               The Cameraman turns, surprised and embarrassed. He buttons 
               up. Pretty Boy and Easy laugh.

                                     HAMMER (O.S.)
                         Wa, c'mon, MoPic, give the folks at 
                         home a thrill. Haul it out. Let 'em 
                         see a real soldier's weapon.

                                     EASY/PRETTY BOY
                         This is my weapon, this is my gun. 
                         With this I kill people, with this I 
                         have fun.

               They show the difference by brandishing their weapons and 
               cupping their crotch. They laugh.

               The Cameraman tries to retrieve his Camera from Hammer. Hammer 
               backs away.

                         rear, post-production. We used to 
                         get these cans of film in, no 
                         cameraman, just the reels. We'd hear 
                         he got shot, or was dead. Spookiest 
                         thing in the world, waiting for that 
                         film to develop. Wondering what you 
                         were going to see. Sometimes you saw 
                         nothing. Other times... Real scary.

                         You ran out of film.

               Hammer and Cracker drag their rucksacks across the ground, 
               making obvious marks.

               Easy walks over to Drewry. Pretty Boy is rebandaging his 
               arm.

                         gum wrappers.

               Drewry is puzzled, but he complies. Easy scatters the wrappers 
               around the campsite.

               OD leaves a full magazine on the ground.

                                     OD
                         First two rounds are good. Third 
                         round, gunpowder's been replaced 
                         with C-4. Bang, bang, boom! Scratch 
                         one enemy and one enemy gun.
                              (to Camera)
                         We're making it look like fifteen 
                         men were here. Makes the gooks chase 
                         us with a larger unit. The larger 
                         the unit, the slower and noisier it 
                         is. We need every edge we can get.

               Cracker digs a small hole. He takes a smoke grenade and a 
               regular grenade from his pack and unscrews the fuses. He 
               swaps fuses and screws them down.

                                     CRACKER
                         Regular grenade's got a three-second 
                         fuse, gives you time to throw it. 
                         Smoke grenade's instantaneous, better 
                         for booby traps.

               Cracker straightens the pin on the grenade, puts it in the 
               hole spoon up and hooks a wire to the pin.

                                     CRACKER
                              (to Drewry)
                         Sir, you've been wearing that steel 
                         pot too long. May I borrow it?

               Drewry takes off his helmet and hands it to Cracker. Cracker 
               puts a couple handfuls of dirt inside the helmet to steady 
               it and sets it on top of the spoon. He checks the balance of 
               the helmet, the tension on the spoon, and carefully pulls 
               the wire and the pin.

                                     DREWRY
                         I signed for that thing.

                         If you want it, sir, you'll have to 
                         get it the way Mister Charlie will. 
                         And I guarantee it'll ruin your whole 
                         day.

               Cracker wipes away all traces of his footprints and the trail 
               of wire. He stands back and admires his work.

               Easy hands Drewry his own soft cap. Drewry puts it on.

               Further along the trail. Cracker strings a wire across the 
               trail to a grenade that has been inserted into a C-ration 
               can. He attaches the wire to the grenade and pulls the pin. 
               The can restrains the spoon.

               Cracker and the Cameraman walk about fifteen feet up the 
               trail. Cracker takes off his bandana and ties it conspicuously 
               to a branch.

                                     CRACKER

               The team is setting up on the side of a ridge. OD and Cracker 
               set up their long rifles using their rucksacks as gun rests. 
               They load their ammunition one round at a time, cleaning 
               each one with a rag. Everyone else wears their packs.

               Pretty Boy and Hammer set up as spotters next to OD and 
               Cracker and get out their binoculars. Pretty Boy lines up 
               his M-79 ammunition in a neat row of six rounds.

               Easy sits behind them with the radio.

               The sun is rising at their backs.

               Everyone whispers.

               OD and Cracker look through their scopes.

                         I see One, dead center, the tent. 
                         Three and Six about two o'clock.

                         I see Two at nine o'clock, Five at 
                         eleven o'clock and moving.

                         Anyone spot Four?

               Drewry takes out his binoculars and looks.

                                     DREWRY
                         Sweet Mary, Mother of Jesus, there's 
                         hundreds of them.

               The Cameraman gets behind OD and zooms down the rifle barrel 
               and focuses on the target area.

               One hundred and fifty men, most sleeping in tents or bed-
               rolls, a few on guard. In the center of the camp eight men 
               are performing tai-chi, graceful and uncaring.

                                     OD
                         They must have gotten reinforced 
                         overnight. Pretty Boy, see that 
                         antenna? Can you reach it with your 
                         Thumper?

               The focus comes back to the team.

               Drewry looks at OD, then back through the binoculars.

                                     PRETTY BOY
                         No sweat, but I'm not sure of the 
                         mortar. Really reaching.

                         That must be a quarter mile.

                         More like a third of a mile, El Tee.

                         That dude wandering around, the VC 
                         guide. People seem to listen to him. 
                         I think the dude's got his shit 
                         together. Lotta men down there, OD.

               OD and Cracker get into position behind their rifles, prone, 
               and snuggle into the dirt.

                         Stand by for coordinates.

               OD and Cracker go through a silent run, making "pow" sounds 
               with their lips, jerking their rifles with each faked shot.

               They plug their ears with plastic earplugs, cigarette filters, 
               whatever they have. Easy and Drewry use cartridges. OD 
               hesitates.

                                     OD
                         Wait one.

               Everyone looks at OD.

                                     OD
                         Most of those dudes ain't the ones I 
                         saw yesterday.

               Cracker takes the binoculars and looks.

                                     CRACKER
                         Must be out humping. Keeping a low 
                         profile for air recon?

                                     OD
                         I say we don't shoot. Call in arty 
                         and just didi mau.

               OD looks at each man in turn. Easy and Pretty Boy nod. Hammer 
               shrugs. OD looks at Drewry.

                                     DREWRY
                         You're the boss of the bush.

               OD nods to Easy.

               Pretty Boy launches five quick rounds while OD and Cracker 
               get up and put their packs on. Hammer keeps his binoculars 
               on the camp. Everyone gets ready to move out.

               Muffled explosions sound.

                                     HAMMER
                         Got 'em! Chuck's hurtin'! Smoke round.

                         Move it.

               The team moves out, fast.

               The crest the ridge and the air above them is ripped by 
               artillery shells. Hammer looks up.

                                     HAMMER
                         Get some.

               Explosions sound in the distance.

               The team runs down slope, OD leading. He spots Cracker's 
               bandana and grabs it off the branch on the run. He makes an 
               immediate left off the trail and the men pass the bandana 
               back to Cracker.

                                     CRACKER
                         I hate it when we don't shoot. Get

               The team is stopped. They look behind them. Drewry is out of 
               breath. The others are all hyper.

                                     DREWRY

                         Sounds like. Wait one to see if your 
                         helmet bounces.

               Jets roar overhead. The men look up.

                         The village. Got it, OD.

               There are muffled explosions. Hammer looks back.

                         The jets are putting the damn damn

                         I should call in my situation report.

               OD looks at Drewry and nods to Easy. Easy gives Drewry the 
               handset and changes the frequency.

                         Not me. Kind of like a personal risk 
                         avoidance policy.

                         Move 'em out.

               The team moves out. There is another muffled boom. Cracker 
               grins at Drewry and flips his hat into the air.

               The team waits and catches their breath. Drewry reaches into 
               Pretty Boy's pack and gets salt tablets. Hammer is still 
               hyper. They all whisper.

                                     PRETTY BOY

                         some water. Not too much, you'll

                         chow down 'til we hit the ville.

               A click in the jungle. Cracker responds with a toy cricket. 
               Click, click.

               OD appears.

                         Gooks ahead, across our trail. Six

                         We go around 'em or through 'em?

                                     HAMMER
                         Through 'em. Time to waste a few.

                         It won't be easy, and it'll be slow.

                                     HAMMER
                         Let's hit 'em. It's our last gig, 
                         let's take back some heads.

               OD looks at the others.

                                     CRACKER
                         What the fuck, can't dance.

                         joke.

               Pretty Boy just smiles. OD looks at Drewry.

                                     DREWRY
                         I can handle it.

               OD sketches a diagram in the dirt.

                                     OD
                         Okay. They're by the stream, about 
                         50 meters up. We do an "L", me here, 
                         Easy, Pretty Boy, and Hammer. Cracker 
                         at the elbow, the El Tee.

                                     PRETTY BOY
                         What about MoPic?

                         He waits back here. I start, a 
                         grenade, then we hit 'em. Hammer, 
                         one carries an RPG, you waste that 
                         motherfucker. Careful of the 
                         crossfire.

                         Let's do it to it.

               They move out.

               BLACK. Sound off.

               CAMERA ON. Sound on.

               The packs are on the ground. OD and Cracker lay their rifles 
               on the packs. Easy tapes two magazines back to back. Pretty 
               Boy arranges his grenades.

                                     OD
                         We get split up, rally on the ville.

               The men are stripped down and ready to move. OD looks them 
               over and nods. They start to move out.

                                     DREWRY
                              (to Cameraman)
                         Stay here, just hang loose.

               The men disappear into the jungle.

               The Cameraman waits for a moment, then follows them into the 
               brush. He catches a few glimpses of Cracker's back.

               Nothing but brush. The Cameraman moves slowly.

               Suddenly, he is upon OD, Easy and Hammer. OD forces him down 
               fiercely. Vietnamese voices can be heard. OD, Easy and Hammer 
               crawl toward the voices.

               The men wait. Easy looks scared. Hammer winks at him.

               OD pulls out a grenade, then pulls the pin. He waits, pops 
               the spoon, silently counts to two and throws the grenade.

               An explosion, a scream, and the team is up at the same 
               instant, charging and firing.

               They burst into the clearing.

               Two VC are prone. One kneels to fire, three are running away.

               The team pours a rain of gunshots into the area. Mass 
               confusion. The three running VC fall. The kneeling soldier 
               is blown down.

               Quiet.

               Easy and Pretty Boy go on guard. OD and Cracker check bodies 
               and take papers. Hammer, pumped up, starts picking up the 
               enemy weapons.

                                     OD
                         Hammer, guard 12 o'clock.

                                     HAMMER
                         War souveniers, OD. First come, 
                         first... This one's alive.

               Hammer aims his machine gun at the VC's head. Drewry, a little 
               dazed by the shooting, wakes up and bumps Hammer aside.

                                     DREWRY
                         Wait a second.

               The Cameraman moves closer to catch the VC. The VC is coming 
               to. Blood comes from his nose and ears. His left leg is 
               wasted.

                                     HAMMER
                         Let me waste him, sir. Sin Loi 
                         motherfucker.

               Hammer aims at the VC again, but Drewry blocks him.

                                     DREWRY
                         He's a prisoner. We take him with 
                         us.

                                     HAMMER
                         Bullshit. No way.

                                     OD
                         Can it, Hammer.

                                     DREWRY
                         We don't murder.

                                     OD
                         We kill. We just did a mess of it.

                                     DREWRY
                         It's not the same, you know it.

               OD looks at the VC, then at Drewry.

                                     OD
                         Bring him back to the rear. We'll 
                         decide there.

               Drewry ties the VC's hands and he and Easy drag the prisoner 
               into the jungle.

                                     DREWRY
                         We've decided.

                                     OD
                         Move it, move it.

               The team leaves the area.

               BLACK. Sound off.

               Sound on.

                                     PRETTY BOY (O.S.)
                         Bac se. Doctor, Medic. Bac se.

               CAMERA ON.

               The men shoulder their gear. Pretty Boy bandages the VC's 
               leg. The prisoner's mouth is now taped shut.

                                     DREWRY
                         We take him back to S-2 for 
                         interrogation. Intelligence, that's 
                         what we're out here for.

               Pretty Boy is very gentle with the VC.

                                     HAMMER
                         Are we bad motherfuckers, or what. 
                         See that shit? We cleaned up. I ain't 
                         shitting you. Zap!

                                     EASY
                         Let's have a hymn for the Major.

                                     EASY/HAMMER/PRETTY BOY
                         Hymmmn, hymmmn, fuck... himmmm.

               OD looks at the VC.

                                     HAMMER
                         Shit, sir, who's gonna carry the 
                         fucker. It'll slow us down like... 
                         He resists and it's a bitch and a 
                         half. If you cold cock the sucker 
                         he's dead weight. He can't walk. 
                         We've done this before.

                                     DREWRY
                         I'll carry him.

                                     PRETTY BOY
                         I'll help.

               Drewry and Pretty Boy strap two rifle slings to the VC's 
               shoulders and legs.

                                     OD
                         He goes with us.

                                     EASY
                         El Tee... "Big D", we're gonna get 
                         you a medal. First time out.

                                     CRACKER
                         Most grunts spend a whole year getting 
                         shot at and shit on and never see 
                         Chuck. You got one to take home.

                                     OD
                         Let's go.

               Drewry and Pretty Boy grab the VC. The team moves out.

               BLACK. Sound off.

               CAMERA ON. Sound on.

               The team is stopped. Drewry cuts a thick bamboo stalk.

                                     HAMMER
                              (looking at VC guns)
                         Bet I get me a hundred bucks apiece 
                         for these from some raggedy assed 
                         chairborne commando.

                                     EASY
                         How about you souvenier me one, 
                         Hammer?

                                     HAMMER
                         How about you kiss my hairy ass?

                                     PRETTY BOY
                         For a little shit, ol' Luke the Gook 
                         is fucking heavy.

                                     CRACKER
                         Don't let him fool you. They stand 
                         small, but fight tall. He's probably 
                         playing possum.

                                     OD
                         C'mon, we're losing time. You know 
                         they're looking for us.

                                     DREWRY
                         Done.

               Drewry finishes trimming the bamboo and he and Pretty Boy 
               slip it through the VC's bindings.

               They lift the pole onto their shoulders.

               BLACK. Sound off.

               CAMERA ON. Sound on.

               The team moves quietly and quickly through the jungle. OD is 
               on point, Hammer, Easy, then Drewry and Pretty Boy carrying 
               the NVA between them. Drewry no longer carries the Nagra, 
               the Cameraman does.

               There is a small break in the trees.

               Easy spins in place and falls to the ground. A shot cracks 
               the air.

               Pretty Boy's right leg collapses under him and he falls. 
               There is another crack.

               The Cameraman runs. Cracker passes the Cameraman and grabs 
               Easy by the harness and drags him to cover with OD and Hammer. 
               Drewry pulls the NVA behind some cover with him.

               OD and Hammer are already looking down their guns, searching 
               for the sniper.

               Hammer fires his machine gun.

                                     OD
                         Enough! Wait 'til you get a target!

               Hammer stops.

               OD looks at Easy. There is a big ragged hole in the radio.

                                     EASY
                         I'm okay! I'm okay!

               He says it to reassure himself.

                                     CRACKER (O.S.)
                         OD! Pretty Boy!

               They look down the trail.

               Pretty Boy is about ten feet away, trying to get up on his 
               good leg. The other one is bloody at the knee. He gets partly 
               up and his other leg is shot out from under him. There is a 
               brief delay and another crack.

               Pretty Boy screams.

                                     HAMMER
                         Jesus, that guy is good. Did you 
                         hear that delay? Must be 500 meters.

                                     EASY
                         OD, you gotta help Pretty Boy!

                                     HAMMER
                         Cover me, Cracker.

               Hammer tosses his machine gun to Cracker. Cracker fires into 
               the jungle.

               Hammer ducks down like a runner in the starting blocks and 
               jumps into the clearing.

               A bullet tears into Hammer's shoulder and stops him dead. OD 
               and Easy grab his feet and pull him back. Crack!

               Cracker stops firing.

               They all look at Pretty Boy. He raises himself up by his 
               elbows and tries to drag himself over to the others, inch by 
               painful inch.

                                     EASY
                         C'mon, Pretty Boy.

                                     OD
                         You can do it, Baldwin.

               Another shot tears Pretty Boy's right elbow to meat and 
               slivers of bone. He screams again. Crack!

                                     EASY
                         Leave him alone! Goddammit! Leave 
                         him alone!

               Easy is about to cry.

               Smack! Another bullet hits Pretty Boy in the thigh. Crack! 
               Hs body jerks with the impact and he screams again, a high 
               piercing wail that fades into a guttural moan.

                                     CRACKER
                         Lord have mercy.

                                     EASY
                         I'm giving it another try.

               Easy gets up, but OD grabs him by the shoulder and pulls him 
               back.

                                     OD
                         No.

                                     OD
                         Get me FDC. Maybe we can get some 
                         fire support.

                                     EASY
                         Radio ain't working.

                                     DREWRY
                         Look.

               Pretty Boy is still alive. He reaches slowly behind him with 
               his left hand and gets a grenade from his canteen cover. He 
               tries to loosen the pin with one hand.

                                     EASY
                         Pretty Boy, no! OD, do something!

                                     OD
                         Cracker, give me your harness.

                                     EASY
                         Pretty Boy, wait!

                                     OD
                         Hold on, Baldwin.

               Pretty Boy stops. OD links his belt with Cracker's, then 
               Drewry's. He creeps toward the edge of the clearing.

               OD tosses the lengths of belt toward Pretty Boy. The end 
               lands about a foot from his head.

               Pretty Boy reaches for the belt and a bullet tears through 
               his palm, throwing his arm in an arc. Crack! Pretty Boy 
               whimpers.

                                     EASY
                              (crying)
                         Oh, goddamn. Fuck. Shit. Cocksucker. 
                         COCKSUCKER!

               Pretty Boy's face lies in the dirt. He painfully turns his 
               head so he can see the team. He wets his lips.

                                     PRETTY BOY
                              (whispering)
                         OD, please.

               Smack! A bullet hits him in the hip. He screams again.

                                     DREWRY
                              (watching OD)
                         What are you doing?

                                     EASY
                         OD, no, don't. OD.

               OD takes Drewry's .45 from his holster and pulls back the 
               slide and makes sure it is loaded. Easy watches through his 
               tears. The slide snaps forward with an ominous click.

               OD aims at Pretty Boy's head.

               Pretty Boy looks at the gun and OD and smiles.

                                     CRACKER
                              (softly)
                         OD, not in the head.

               BOOM!

               Pretty Boy's body jerks with the impact of OD's bullet. He 
               is dead.

               Silence. Then the sound of Easy crying softly.

               BLACK. Sound off.

               CAMERA ON. Sound on.

               Pretty Boy's body is on a poncho. Cracker takes the dog tag 
               from around his neck, untapes them and puts one in Pretty 
               Boy's mouth and tapes it shut. He does it gently, as if it 
               were a ceremony.

               Cracker pulls the poncho over Pretty Boy's face. Easy cries 
               off screen. He snaps the poncho shut, one at a time. The 
               sound of the snaps is very loud.

               OD bandages Hammer's shoulder while Hammer remains on guard.

               Easy shivers uncontrollably a couple of times and looks at 
               his dead radio.

               Drewry looks at the NVA. OD finishes with Hammer and walks 
               over to Drewry.

                                     OD
                         Gut shot. Looks like your gook's 
                         broke, El Tee.

                                     DREWRY
                         Will he make it to Brigade?

                                     OD
                         No. We ain't taking him.

                                     DREWRY
                         What?

                                     OD
                         We got a choice. We carry your gook 
                         or Pretty Boy. We can't take both.

                                     DREWRY
                         But... he's dead.

               Silence. The team looks coldly at Drewry.

                                     HAMMER
                         Americans never leave their dead 
                         behind.

               Drewry looks at the team, the NVA, Pretty Boy, the NVA again.

                                     DREWRY
                         You're not going to kill him.

                                     OD
                         No, you are, El Tee.

               Everyone looks at OD. His face is filled with anger.

                                     DREWRY
                         You can't make me.

                                     OD
                         We're leaving Luke the Gook. If his 
                         people get to him before he dies he 
                         can tell them all about us. We're 
                         almost out of ammo, one of us is 
                         hurt, everything. Intelligence, El 
                         Tee, intelligence.

               Drewry reaches reluctantly for his gun.

                                     OD
                         No gun, El Tee. Noise discipline. 
                         Your knife makes it personal.

               OD takes Drewry's bayonet and slaps it into his hand. The 
               NVA stares up at Drewry, his eyes wide with fear and pain.

                                     OD
                         It's time you were blooded, El Tee. 
                         Your own private KIA.

               Drewry looks down at the NVA.

                                     DREWRY
                         He's going to die anyway.

                                     OD
                         Maybe. C'mon, El Tee. No, wait a 
                         second.

               OD reaches into Drewry's shirt and pulls out the NVA's papers. 
               OD's eyes burn with cold, hard fury. Cracker reaches out to 
               stop him, but OD jerks away.

                                     OD
                         You might want to know who you're 
                         killing.
                              (reading)
                         His name's Truong, Nguyen Truong. 
                         He's 19. Got a family, looks like, 
                         wife, cute kid.

               OD throws the papers onto the NVA's chest as he reads them. 
               The last is a black and white photograph of a woman and child.

                                     OD
                         C'mon, El Tee, what're you waiting 
                         for?

               OD's voice has an edge of hysteria.

                                     CRACKER
                         OD.

                                     HAMMER
                         Kill the fucker, El Tee.

               Drewry raises the bayonet and stabs the NVA clumsily in the 
               chest. He pulls it back out quickly and turns away.

                                     OD
                         Damn, El Tee, can't you even kill a 
                         man right?

               The NVA's chest rises with shallow breaths and blood pumps 
               from the wound.

               OD bends over the NVA with his Gerber knife and shoves it up 
               under his ribcage and slices the heart. The NVA dies.

               OD wipes the blade on the NVA's sleeve. He cuts the ropes 
               from his hands and feet and slices the tape off his mouth. 
               Blood gushes out.

               OD drapes the NVA flag over the dead man's face and kneels 
               there for a moment, almost like he is praying.

               Cracker puts a gentle hand on OD's shoulder.

                                     CRACKER
                         OD, we better move out. I'm going to 
                         destroy the long rifles, Pretty Boy's 
                         gear.
                              (to Hammer)
                         Give me a Willy Peter.
                              (beat)
                         OD?

               OD nods and gets up slowly.

                                     OD
                         Better melt down the radio, too.

               Easy takes off the radio and gets a white phosphorous grenade 
               from his pack.

               Drewry sits on the ground looking at his bayonet.

               BLACK. Sound off.

               CAMERA ON. Sound on.

               The team is stopped, all out of breath, facing outward on 
               guard. Easy and Drewry have been carrying Pretty Boy's body 
               between them, the pole through the poncho. OD's jaw muscles 
               flex as he stares into the jungle.

                                     HAMMER
                         How much farther to the ville?

                                     OD
                         Three, four klicks. Seven-niner 
                         degrees. Remember that, Hammer, seven-
                         niner.

                                     HAMMER
                         I got it, OD, no sweat. Anyhow, I 
                         just follow you.
                              (beat)
                         Damn, I'd like a cold brew.

                                     EASY
                         I could use some dew. No, no, hash. 
                         Quick toke of hash, dreamland. Grass 
                         makes me paranoid.

               Easy laughs. It is forced. OD looks at him and almost smiles.

                                     OD
                         You're one dinky dau ditty bopper.

                                     EASY
                         And I'm short. 25 and a wake-up. I'm 
                         so short I could parachute off a 
                         dime.

                                     HAMMER
                         I wish I had a cold brew.

                                     CRACKER
                         Wish in one hand, shit in the other, 
                         see which hand's full first.

                         What kind of job you gonna get us in 
                         the rear, OD?

               OD looks at Drewry, who is self-absorbed and quiet.

                                     OD
                         I don't know, some ghost job. One 
                         thing I do know, it'll be air-
                         conditioned.

               Their conversation is strained.

                                     CRACKER
                         With my own little refrigerator.

                                     HAMMER
                         For cold brew.

                                     OD
                         There's a slot open at the rec room. 
                         We'll sent Easy to Thailand on R&R 
                         so he don't get into trouble before 
                         he takes that freedom bird back to 
                         the Real World.

                                     EASY
                         Can you do that for me, OD? I'd dig 
                         it. Love that Thai pussy, cheap, 
                         too. Me and Pretty Boy... What about 
                         Hammer?

                                     CRACKER
                         Hammer's too tough for the rear.

                                     HAMMER
                         Got muscles in my shit.

                                     EASY
                         Bites the heads off animal crackers.

                                     CRACKER
                         Last time I was in the rear I called 
                         home on the MARS line. Got the wife 
                         on the horn, she didn't believe it 
                         was me calling from the Nam. After 
                         we talked about that we didn't have 
                         shit to say to each other. Dead 
                         silence. Not word one.

               BLACK. Sound off.

               CAMERA ON. Sound on.

               The Camera looks over OD's shoulder as he consults his 
               compass.

                                     OD
                         The tree, the big pine.

               OD pockets the compass and Hammer hands him his CAR-15.

               OD starts walking. The Cameraman stands to one side and lets 
               OD and Hammer walk by him. Drewry and Easy follow with the 
               body.

               Suddenly, out of the trees, walk three NVA.

               The NVA freeze, as startled as the Americans.

               Drewry and Easy drop Pretty Boy. It's like a signal. The 
               team fires. The NVA fire back, but it's too late.

               The Cameraman hits the ground as the team charges the NVA. 
               Drewry hits the ground, too, but he faces the rear, gun ready.

               BLACK.

               Gunfire.

               The Cameraman lifts the Camera. OD and Easy come out of the 
               brush. Hammer stays behind and fires a slug or two into each 
               of the NVA bodies.

               OD is furious. He heads over to Drewry, who is getting off 
               the ground. OD is holding his stomach and blood leaks through 
               his fingers.

                                     OD
                         What the fuck are you doing?! Don't 
                         they teach you shit in fucking OCS?! 
                         You attack, fucker! Attack!

                                     DREWRY
                         I was guarding our rear! That's what 
                         I was taught. In an ambush... Fuck 
                         it!

                                     OD
                         That was Pretty Boy's job.

               The fire in OD is suddenly gone. He looks off screen and 
               runs. The Camera follows.

               Cracker is laying on the ground, three bloody holes in his 
               chest.

                                     CRACKER
                         It hurts, Godalmighty, it hurts. 
                         Hurts like nothing ever did, OD.

                                     OD
                         Pretty Boy! Morphine!

               Cracker grabs OD's sleeve and pulls him closer.

                                     CRACKER
                         OD, Pretty Boy's dead.

               Cracker's words are soft and gentle. OD chokes up.

                                     OD
                         Cracker, don't you dare die on me, 
                         motherfucker. I need you, you're my 
                         friend. Frye?

               Easy and Hammer join OD. There is blood pouring down Hammer's 
               leg.

                                     CRACKER
                         No sweat, GI. Three slugs ain't 
                         nothing. Guys catch worse and live, 
                         I seen it. Funny, I counted them 
                         when they hit. One, two, three. I 
                         just fell back real slow, thinking, 
                         "Shit, I been hit three fucking 
                         times". AK?

                                     OD
                         I guess.

               Cracker lifts his head and looks at the foaming blood pumping 
               from his chest.

                                     CRACKER
                         Jesus, looks like a sucking chest 
                         wound, OD. Get something to plug it.

               Easy rips the plastic cover from a bandage and OD places it 
               over the wound.

                                     HAMMER
                         I got a morphine vial.

               Hammer hands the morphine to OD. OD prepares it.

                                     HAMMER
                         We gotta move it, OD. The gunfire, 
                         the gooks must have heard it.

                                     OD
                         You're gonna be okay, Cracker. We 
                         been through some shit together, 
                         huh, Frye? We'll get through this 
                         one.

                                     CRACKER
                         Three slugs ain't nothing, I seen 
                         guys a lot worse.

               OD pulls up Cracker's sleeve to inject the morphine.

                                     CRACKER
                         Save it, OD, don't hurt no more. 
                         Can't feel a fucking thing.

               Cracker dies.

               OD bends over Cracker's body, tears dripping onto Cracker's 
               face.

               OD tips his head back to scream, but all that comes out is a 
               tortured rasp.

               The bodies of Cracker and Pretty Boy lay next to each other 
               under a tree. OD marks the spot on his map.

                                     OD
                         We'll send a chopper back.

                                     DREWRY
                         Americans never abandon their dead.

               No one pays any attention to Drewry.

               The team moves out.

               CAMERA ON. Sound on.

               Drewry is cleaning his M-16 carefully, methodically. Easy is 
               bandaging OD's stomach wound, wrapping duct tape around his 
               middle. He watches OD's face, trying not to hurt him.

               Easy finishes and hands the tape to Hammer. Hammer tapes his 
               thigh while he remains on guard.

                                     HAMMER

                         Boy's luck. You figure that happens?

                         someone and then up and jumps onto 
                         someone else?

               He grins and looks at everyone. There is a bloody patch near 
               his ear.

               The smile fades as he looks into the jungle. He thinks 
               something over, chewing his cheek. He looks into the Camera.

                                     HAMMER
                         In case... if I don't... If my luck 
                         jumps, you know...
                              (beat)
                         I want my folks, especially my old 
                         man, my dad, to know I did a damn 
                         good job. Maybe I wasn't any hero, 
                         but I did the best job I could.

               Hammer turns away, embarrassed. He looks back into the jungle.

                                     HAMMER
                         But I got Pretty Boy's luck, I won't 
                         worry none. You know, I could almost 
                         feel it come onto me when Pretty Boy 
                         got...

               There is silence.

               OD gets up, wincing with pain. Easy watches him, feeling the 
               same pain. Drewry watches them all, deep in thought.

                                     EASY
                         Best I can do.

                                     OD
                         It'll work.

                                     EASY
                         OD, I'm scared. We're in deep shit.

                                     OD
                         Stevie Wonder could see that, Easy.

               Easy restlessly, unconsciously, works the bolt of his carbine, 
               jacking the rounds out of the magazine.

                                     EASY
                         No, I mean, really, my shit's gotten 
                         all flaky. I'm not cut out for this 
                         shit no more. You gotta cut me some 
                         slack, OD, I can't hack it no more.

               Easy is intently serious, but on the verge of tears, trying 
               to express his sincerity through his panic.

                                     EASY
                         I don't wanna die. I didn't give a 
                         rat fuck before, but I do now. Maybe 
                         I'm too short. OD, you gotta cover 
                         my ass.

               Tears fall from Easy's eyes. He sniffs and wipes his nose 
               with the back of his hand. He looks like a little kid.

                                     OD
                         You out of pills?

                                     EASY
                              (smiling)
                         Can't get nothing by you, OD.

               Easy sees Hammer looking at him.

                                     EASY
                         Don't look at me like that, 
                         motherfucker. I'll kill you.

                                     HAMMER
                              (softly)
                         It's okay, Easy.

               OD hugs Easy, but gingerly because of his wound.

                                     OD
                         I'll take care of you, Easy, I will. 
                         I ever lie to you?

                                     EASY
                         No sweat. I'm just a little fucked 
                         'cause of Pretty Boy and Cracker, 
                         you know.

               Easy takes a deep breath and pulls back from OD.

                                     EASY
                         Hey, OD, what's the difference between 
                         fish and meat?

                                     OD
                         What?

                                     EASY
                         If you beat your fish it'll die.

               OD smiles and playfully slaps Easy on the cheek.

                                     OD
                         Dinky dau motherfucker. Now pick up 
                         that brass.

               Easy looks down and sees the cartridges and he's surprised. 
               He picks them up.

                                     DREWRY
                         Easy, here. Maybe this'll make you 
                         feel more secure.

               OD and Easy look at Drewry. Drewry has taken off his flak 
               vest. He offers it to Easy. Easy takes it and shrugs off his 
               LBE to put it on.

               Drewry and OD look at each other.

                                     DREWRY
                         I think I should take over now, you're 
                         incapacitated.

                                     OD
                         Like shit.

                                     DREWRY
                         I don't want to argue. You'll hardly 
                         be able to walk with that wound.

               OD is angry. He takes a step toward Drewry, refusing to show 
               the pain. Easy tries to help, but OD pushes him away with 
               Cracker's shotgun.

                                     DREWRY
                         See. I'll take point.

                                     OD
                         And get us all greased. No way, GI.

               OD looks at Easy and Hammer for their reaction. Easy's fear 
               is evident. Hammer gives him an "I don't give a shit" look.

                                     OD
                         Hammer'll walk point. And we move 
                         now and fast. We got a pickup to 
                         meet.

                                     HAMMER
                         Out-fucking-standing. You're one 
                         hard corps dude, OD.

                                     EASY
                         And you're one silly, gung-ho fucker, 
                         Hammer.

                                     HAMMER
                         Yeah, no shit. Like Cracker says... 
                         said... if you're gonna be a bear, 
                         be a grizzly.

               Hammer moves out first. The Cameraman waits for OD, who is 
               leaning on Easy. OD motions the Cameraman ahead of him.

                                     DREWRY
                         I'll bring up the rear.

               They follow Hammer.

                                     OD
                         Watch out for booby traps, stay off 
                         the trails. Stop every few meters 
                         just to listen.

                                     HAMMER
                         I can handle it, OD, cut me some 
                         slack.

               Hammer talks without stopping his progress through the jungle.

                                     HAMMER
                         I ain't no cherry. I... Oh, shit.

               BOOM!

               Hammer is blown backward by the blast from a mine.

               The Cameraman dives for the ground. BLACK.

               The Cameraman starts to get up. Hammer's body is close to 
               the lens, face and chest torn by shrapnel. His mouth is open 
               and his wide, dead eyes stare at the Camera.

               The Cameraman scuttles away from the body. Easy bends over 
               Hammer.

                                     EASY
                         Oh, Hammer, I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry.

               Drewry is suddenly standing over Hammer's body. He picks up 
               the M-60.

                                     DREWRY
                         He's dead. C'mon.

               Drewry leads the way. OD and Easy walk past the Cameraman, 
               looking at Hammer's body. Easy drops his rifle. OD picks it 
               up.

               The Cameraman gets up and hurries after the others.

               BLACK. Sound off.

               CAMERA ON. Sound on.

               Drewry, OD and Easy are crouched at the base of a tree on 
               the edge of a small, burned village. There is nothing moving, 
               just smoke curling into the sky from the burned huts.

                                     OD
                         Let's check it out. Choppers'll be 
                         here soon.

               OD gets up to lead the way, but Easy has to help him stand. 
               Drewry leads the way, his M-16 slung, carrying Hammer's M-60 
               at the ready.

               They enter the village slowly and cautiously. Easy drags his 
               carbine behind him.

               There are bodies of old men and women here and there, a few 
               children. There is a dead chicken, a dog. Drewry bends over 
               one of the bodies. Mortar craters pock the ground.

                                     OD
                         Careful, El Tee, booby traps.

               Drewry backs away from the body.

               The three men stick close together, carefully checking each 
               body.

                                     DREWRY
                         I wonder who did this, us or them.

                                     OD
                         Does it make a difference?
                              (beat)
                         We wouldn't leave this much standing. 
                         Must be Chuck's work.

               OD tries to walk forward by himself as Drewry and Easy 
               continue checking bodies.

                                     OD
                         Keep an eye out. Chuck's crowding 
                         our ass.

               OD collapses. Easy and Drewry run over to him.

                                     DREWRY
                              (to Camera)
                         Put that thing down and give me a 
                         hand.

               BLACK. Sound off.

               CAMERA ON. Sound on.

               A lean-to made from a poncho has been propped over OD. Easy 
               watches him. Easy's tears have dried, but he is on the edge. 
               Maybe over.

                                     OD
                         I'm not saying all gooks look the 
                         same.
                              (coughing laugh)
                         It's just... I go to Sin City, all 
                         the gook faces look like some gook I 
                         shot. You know, spooky like. Ghosts.

               OD is silent a long moment. Easy turns away. Drewry looks at 
               Easy with concern.

                                     EASY
                         How about that morphine, El Tee?

                                     DREWRY
                         No, we have to keep him conscious 
                         for the chopper.

                                     EASY
                              (joking feebly)
                         How about for me?

               Drewry smiles.

                                     OD
                         That ain't counting the other dead 
                         men. GI's. The ones I didn't kill.

               OD jerks his head up, suddenly alert, and looks at Drewry.

                                     OD
                         I'll be okay, El Tee. Don't worry 
                         about me, just keep an ear out for 
                         the chopper.

                                     EASY
                         OD? Am I gonna die?

                                     OD
                         Who'd want to kill a doofus ditty 
                         bopper like you?

               Drewry looks at his watch.

                                     DREWRY
                         Half hour to pickup. The NVA will 
                         try something.

                                     EASY
                         Chuck ain't shot his wad yet.

                                     OD
                         We better prepare, set some fire 
                         lanes. You got a red smoke, El Tee?

                                     DREWRY
                         No.

                                     OD
                         You pop a red smoke for a hot LZ. We 
                         gotta let the choppers know Chuck's 
                         waiting, too. Here.

               OD hands Drewry one of his smoke grenades.

               Drewry looks at the grenade.

                                     EASY
                         Don't sweat it, El Tee. Hell, what 
                         you want to do, live forever?

               OD tries to get up. A spasm of pain runs through him and he 
               falls back down.

               The Cameraman runs over to help OD.

               BLACK. Sound off.

               CAMERA ON. Sound on.

               Easy and the Cameraman are inside a hut. OD sits in the 
               doorway with the M-60, his back to the Camera.

               Across the village, Drewry is getting into position with the 
               M-16 and CAR-15.

                                     EASY
                         How you doing, OD?

                                     OD
                         Can't feel my legs, but it don't 
                         hurt much if I don't move too quick. 
                         Should be hearing the choppers soon.

                                     EASY
                         One good thing about the Nam. You 
                         hear a chopper, you know it's ours.

               There is a moment of silence.

                                     OD
                         Here they come.

               Drewry starts firing.

               OD fires.

               Bullets rip through the hut. Easy and the Cameraman hit the 
               ground.

               There is another sound that breaks through the gunfire.

                                     EASY
                         Choppers! Pop smoke, El Tee! Pop 
                         smoke!

               Drewry readies the smoke grenade, but before he can throw it 
               another one lands in the middle of the village. Green smoke.

                                     EASY
                         Oh, shit!

               Drewry looks up at the sky and runs into the clearing toward 
               the green smoke grenade. OD increases his fire to cover him. 
               Bullets tear up the earth around him, but Drewry manages to 
               kick the green smoke grenade away.

               Drewry dodges for cover and throws the red smoke grenade.

               The sound of helicopters increases and the firing of mini-
               guns is heard.

               The helicopters fire rockets. There are sounds of battle all 
               around the village. Easy crouches down, his hands over his 
               head.

               The ground fire ceases. There is the sound of helicopters 
               and the mini-guns firing in spurts.

               The sound of helicopters is very loud. Easy is crying and 
               hugging the ground.

               Drewry runs across the village and into the hut.

                                     DREWRY
                         C'mon, move it! Move it! The choppers!

               Drewry manhandles Easy out the door and toward a helicopter 
               hovering above the ground.

               The Cameraman pauses next to OD, who fires sporadically into 
               the jungle. OD looks up.

                                     OD
                         Move it, troop.

               The Cameraman follows Drewry and Easy.

               More gunfire sounds. The door gunner fires into the jungle. 
               The door gunner is hit and he slumps in his retaining sling.

               The pilot waves Drewry and the others on.

               They get to the chopper and Drewry pushes Easy aboard. Drewry 
               looks back and sees OD sprawled in front of the hut, trying 
               to get up. OD falls.

                                     EASY
                         OD!

               Drewry runs back for OD.

               The Cameraman puts down his Camera inside the chopper and 
               runs after Drewry.

               Easy mans the chopper machine guns and fires into the jungle.

               Drewry and the Cameraman lift OD and drag him toward the 
               chopper. OD screams in pain.

               The Cameraman is hit and falls, but he gets up and continues 
               toward the chopper.

               Easy is screaming as he fires.

               They reach the chopper and manhandle OD inside. The Cameraman 
               is hit again and he screams. Drewry steps onto the skid.

               The Cameraman is hit again and falls back, dead.

               The chopper lifts as Drewry, hanging onto the skid, reaches 
               hopelessly for the Cameraman. He finally climbs inside.

               The helicopter lifts out of sight of earth. Only sky.

               BLACK.

               Sound off.

                                         THE END
