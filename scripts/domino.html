     <b>INT. DMV -- AFTERNOON</b>

     The DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES. SOUTH CENTRAL LOS ANGELES.
     People are jam-packed into the internal maze of cubicles. It
     doesn't get more crowded and disgusting than this. <i>THE SOUND
     OF SCREAMING BABIES IS INTERRUPTED BY A-</i>

     BING.

                          ROBOTIC FEMALE VOICE (V.O.)
                <i>Now serving F134. Please report
                to window eight.</i>

     This is the sound that the DMV AUTOMATED SYSTEM makes every
     fifteen seconds. A BING for each human being who waits to be
     processed through the system.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                <i>When I was a little girl... my
                mum took me to Euro Disney on
                opening day. I was told that it
                was the happiest place on earth.</i>

     BOY looks down at the little piece of PAPER in his hand with
     the number B144 printed on it... wakes up DAD. They move
     toward window twelve.

                          DOMINO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                <i>A week later... we moved to Los
                Angeles. I was told that this was
                the saddest place on Earth. The
                Department of Motor Vehicles in
                Los Angeles.</i>

     The CAMERA PANS across more POOR PEOPLE. They look down at
     their numbers.  Mostly Hispanic, African-American.

                          DOMINO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                <i>They wait for their number to be
                called. They wait for this
                license to drive to yet another
                miserable job... dive pub...
                drive by shooting.</i>
                     (beat)
                <i>That is if they're lucky enough
                to own an automobile. Most of
                them aren't. They need a license
                to prove their citizenship or
                else they'll be deported.</i>

     The CAMERA ARRIVES at the last chair on the row. There is a
     FRATERNITY GUY named FRANCES (20) sitting in it.

                          DOMINO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                <i>Except for this bloke. His name
                is Frances. Mr. 90210 college boy
                had found himself in the wrong
                place at the wrong time.</i>

     Frances has a MOTOROLA to his ear. He seems very anxious.

                          FRANCES
                     (whispering into the phone)
                I said... they're about to call
                my number. Are you in... or are
                you out?

     Frances taps his shoe nervously on the linoleum floor.

                          FRANCES (CONT'D)
                A thousand all in for one
                license. That's the deal.

     Frances grits his teeth.

                          FRANCES (CONT'D)
                You have to decide right now.
                They're gonna call my number any
                second.

     Frances takes a deep breath. A sigh of relief.

                          FRANCES (CONT'D)
                Alright. We're on.

     He hangs up the phone, then glances up at the MONITOR...
     waiting for his number. The CAMERA MOVES slowly into his
     face.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                <i>There are three kinds of people
                in this world. The rich... the
                poor... and everyone in between.</i>

     A bead of SWEAT rolls down Frances' temple. He glances over at a
     BLACK TEENAGER filling out a form. Brief eye contact. Frances
     looks away.

                          DOMINO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                <i>The poor people hate the rich
                because... well... they're
                fucking rich.</i>

     BING.

                          ROBOTIC FEMALE VOICE (V.O.)
                <i>Now serving G086. Please report
                to window six.</i>

     Frances glances down at his number. G086. He takes a deep
     breath and walks over to WINDOW SIX.

     Sitting behind the counter is LATEESHA RODRIGUEZ (28). She is
     filing her FINGERNAILS. They are VERY LONG... VERY SHARP...
     and VERY COLORFUL.

                          FRANCES
                Kee Kee.

     Lateesha raises her eyes to meet Frances. He drops an
     ENVELOPE on the desk in front of her. Lateesha's demeanor
     changes. She slowly opens the envelope and removes a piece of
     PAPER from inside.

                          FRANCES (CONT'D)
                Four.

     Lateesha returns her gaze to Frances. She then folds the
     paper, places it back into the envelope and drops it into a
     drawer.

                          LATEESHA
                Four to six weeks.

     Frances glares back at her.

                          FRANCES
                You said you could deliver the
                ID's <i>tonight</i>.

     Lateesha has gone back to filing her turbo nails.

                          LATEESHA
                Four to six weeks... <i>Frances</i>.

     Frances' blood has begun to boil.

                          FRANCES
                    (fierce whisper)
                Listen, <i>bitch</i>. I'm paying you
                double this time. Kee Kee said
                <i>tonight</i>. I paid half in advance
                like she said.

     Rage is building in Lateesha's eyes. <i>No one talks to her this
     way and gets away with it</i>.

     In the next CUBICLE... RAOUL SANCHEZ (30), an OBESE HISPANIC
     MAN with BLONDS HIGHLIGHTS, leans his head over.

                          RAOUL
                Lateesha... I need that web link.

     <i>Lateesha does not answer. Her eyes are locked on Frances.</i>

                          LATEESHA
                Kee Kee don't make the rules. I
                said... four to six weeks.

                          FRANCES
                I don't know if you realize who
                the fuck you're dealing with
                here. I can have your job
                eliminated like <i>that</i>.
                    (beat)
                Say good-bye to your little side
                business...

     Frances cranes his neck to see the NAME PLATE on her desk.

                          FRANCES (CONT'D)
                ...<i>Lateesha</i>. If that <i>is</i> your real
                name.
                    (beat)
                If you don't have those ID's
                ready tonight by 8PM like Kee Kee
                promised... you can say hello to
                the fucking welfare line... cause
                your life as government employee
                is <i>over</i>.

     Raoul is persistent.

                          RAOUL
                Teesha... I need that web link!
                The J-Lo concert is probably sold
                out already!

     Lateesha raises one GIGANTIC FINGERNAIL in Raoul's direction
     as if to say... <i>IN A MINUTE</i>. Raoul sighs impatiently and
     ducks back into his cubicle... cursing her in Spanish.

                          FRANCES
                What's it gonna be, Lateesha? Get
                ready to start counting those
                food stamps.

     Lateesha opens the DRAWER and removes the envelope. Gears are
     turning. Decisions are being made.

                          LATEESHA
                Tonight. 8PM.

     She taps her nails on the plastic surface of the table.

                          LATEESHA (CONT'D)
                Anything else?

     Frances shakes his head slowly.

                          FRANCES
                Nope.

                          LATEESHA
                Good-bye... <i>Frances</i>.

     As Frances turns to leave, Lateesha slams a PLASTIC SIGN down
     onto the ledge of WINDOW SIX. It reads: THIS WINDOW CLOSED.
     Lateesha then unfolds the piece of PAPER inside the envelope.

     The following SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS are printed in BLACK INK:

          <b>774-32-5543 : 342-77-0098 : 323-34-5452 : 854-80-6745</b>

     Lateesha stares at the numbers... gears turning.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                <i>Love is a desperate measure</i>.

     Lateesha takes the LOCKET that hangs around her neck and
     opens it. Inside... there are two photographs. A TEENAGE GIRL
     and a LITTLE BABY.

                          LATEESHA
                Fuck 'em. Fuck 'em all.

     Lateesha takes a deep breath... kisses the locket and closes it.
     She drops the paper down on the table and begins to type the
     SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS into her COMPUTER.

     Raoul leans over once again.

                          RAOUL
                Lateesha... I needed that web
                link an hour ago!

     Lateesha continues typing... disregarding his annoying plea.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                <i>Desperate measures often have
                disastrous consequences...</i>

     Raoul stands up. He is losing his temper.

                          RAOUL
                Lateesha... girl... are you
                listening?

     Nope. Fingernails keep typing. FOUR DRIVER'S LICENSES pop up on
     her computer screen. We get a glance at FOUR DMV PHOTOS. FOUR
     MEN. <i>FRANCES is one of them</i>.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                <i>The story of my life.</i>

     Raoul's voice has become an unbearable high-pitched shrill.

                          RAOUL
                LATEESHA... THE WEB LINK. I NEED
                IT RIGHT NOW! THE CONCERT IS
                GONNA SELL OUT! WE'RE NOT GONNA
                MAKE IT!

     Lateesha whips her head around with the SASSY OUTRAGE
     cultivated by so many years at this shitty job.

                          LATEESHA

<pre>
     The entire DMV is silenced.  Raoul lowers back into his chair.

     Lateesha turns back to her computer screen. She aligns the
     MOUSE POINTER on the word SEND. She then lowers her GIGANTIC
     FINGERNAIL onto the MOUSE with the sound of DISTANT THUNDER.

     BEGIN CREDIT SEQUENCE: U2 & JOHNNY CASH - THE WANDERER
</b>
     The STREETS are filled with MILLIONS upon MILLIONS of
     DOMINOES. They are assembled in many colorful patterns seen
     in such 80's television programs as "THAT'S INCREDIBLE!" and
     "RIPLEY'S... BELIEVE IT OR NOT!".

     At the intersection of Wilshire and Santa Monica, THOUSANDS
     of falling dominoes assembled to spell out:

     In Beverly Hills... there are thousands of falling dominoes
     assembled to spell out:

     On the abandoned 10 FREEWAY the dominoes read:

     On the abandoned 405 FREEWAY the dominoes read:
<b>

</b>
     We follow the IMMENSE TRAIL of falling dominoes throughout
     the city... through DOWNTOWN... CENTURY CITY... SANTA
     MONICA... COMPTON... revealing the rest of the OPENING
     CREDITS.

     As we near the end of the sequence the trail takes us out
     into the DESERT where the falling dominoes read:
<b>
                         WRITTEN BY RICHARD KELLY
</b>
     The dominoes approach the lights of LAS VEGAS... approaching the
     western end of the STRIP. It is completely desolate. The lights
     twinkle... <i>but there is no one there.</i>

     The dominoes finish on a PEDESTRIAN TRAFFIC BRIDGE that
     crosses the strip. They read:
<b>
                          DIRECTED BY TONY SCOTT

</b>
     The TRAIL of dominoes tapers off into a CEMENT HALLWAY...
     leading into the shadows. A METAL DOOR looms in the distance.

     The CAMERA lingers on the FINAL DOMINO... moving through the
     METAL DOOR.
<b>
     INT. VEGAS SECURITY LOCKDOWN -- NIGHT
</b>
     DOMINO HARVEY (25) sits alone at a METAL TABLE. Despite her
     disheveled appearance, she looks like she could be on the cover
     of VOGUE.

     Her hands are cuffed together. She holds a MARLBORO RED between
     the fingers on her right hand... raising it to her mouth. <i>There
     is BLOOD SPLATTERED on her hand. A small cut on her lip.</i>

     A SINGLE TEAR traces down her cheek. There is a CHILD LINGERING
     just beneath the tough surface veneer.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                <i>My name is Domino Harvey.</i>
                    (beat)
                <i>I am... a bounty hunter.</i>

     Domino flips a book of MATCHES between her fingers. She raises
     her eyes to the GLASS WALL on the south end of the room.

                          DOMINO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                <i>They're watching me from behind
                that two way mirror. What I say
                over the next several hours will
                determine whether or not I spend
                the rest of my life in prison.</i>

     Domino takes a pull from her Marlboro, wiping the tear away from
     her face. The METAL DOOR opens... and an attractive woman in a
     black business suit steps into the room. Her name is TARYN MILES
     (38).

                          TARYN
                Ms. Harvey... my name is Taryn
                Miles. I'm a criminal
                psychologist working for the FBI.
                I'm here to ask you a few
                questions.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                <i>Here's the part where I'm
                supposed to get all defensive and
                say... 'not until I speak with my
                attorney.'</i>

     Domino takes another pull from her Marlboro... then stubs it in
     the ash tray.

                          DOMINO (CONT'D)
                Sure... I'll tell you everything
                I know.

     Taryn removes a file from her attache case and places it on the
     table.

                          TARYN
                Thirty-six hours ago... ten
                million dollars was stolen from
                an armored car that was
                subsequently found abandoned at
                the Hoover Dam.
<b>
     EXT. DESERT -- DAWN -- THIRTY-SIX HOURS BEFORE
</b>

     The CAMERA SOARS over the desert... approaching the lights at
     the Hoover Dam. An ARMORED CAR is parked on the edge of the
     cement abyss.

                          TARYN (V.O.)
                <i>The driver's name was Locus
                Fender. We know that he was in on
                the heist.</i>
<b>
     INT. ARMORED CAR -- NEXT
</b>
     LOCUS FENDER (30s) is behind the wheel of the armored car. His
     unshaven, disheveled appearance looks totally out of place in
     his security uniform.
<b>
     INT. VEGAS SECURITY LOCKDOWN -- NIGHT
</b>
     Taryn is now scrawling notes on a pad.

                          TARYN
                Where is the money?

                          DOMINO
                I don't know.

                          TARYN
                I think that you're lying. I
                think you know exactly where the
                money is.

                          DOMINO
                You're trying to scare me into
                falsely incriminating myself...
                and it's not working. I said I'd
                tell you everything I know. You
                and your friends behind the
                mirror.

     Domino waves to the mirror. Taryn calmly opens her file...
     refusing to lose control.

                          TARYN
                Is it true that you were hired to
                track down and capture the
                thieves... and then deliver them
                to Drake Bishop... owner of the
                Stratosphere Hotel & Casino?

                          DOMINO
                Yes.

                          TARYN
                You then learned where the
                thieves had hidden the money...
                and at the instructions of your
                employer went to retrieve it
                yourself.

                          DOMINO
                He sent us out to the Fender
                Compound. Out in the desert near
                the Chicken Ranch.

<b>
     INT. FENDER HOUSE -- THE PREVIOUS NIGHT
</b>
     The FRONT DOOR to this house is KICKED FORWARD... snapping
     off its hinges onto the cheap tile floor.

     A HISPANIC MAN named CHOCO (38) is standing there with a
     SHOTGUN. He steps forward into the DOUBLE WIDE TRAILER HOME
     attached to an ADOBE SHACK.

     Behind him is a CAUCASIAN MAN named ED MARTIN (50s) wielding
     his own shotgun.

     As the two men part ways... DOMINO... wearing jeans and a T-
     shirt... follows them through the doorway into the house. She
     carries a SEMI-AUTOMATIC PISTOL... moving into the FAMILY ROOM
     ahead of the men.

     The tiny family room is pure SOUTH-WESTERN DESERT TRAILER PARK
     kitsch. None of the furniture matches. Shag carpeting. Georgia
     O'Keefe knockoffs on the walls. Stained wagon-wheel coffee
     tables.

     Domino notices the LA-Z-BOY in the corner of the room. <i>It is
     gently rocking back and forth.</i>

     A low growling noise can be heard from the kitchen.

                          DOMINO
                EDNA! WE KNOW YOU'RE IN HERE!

     Domino turns back to the men with a raised finger... issuing
     a silent warning.

     In the KITCHEN... EDNA FENDER (60s) is sitting on the floor
     against the cabinets. There is a SHOTGUN in her left hand. A
     PIT-BULL is restrained by its COLLAR in her right.

     She looks down at the dog, CHI-CHI (3), with a clenched jaw.

                          EDNA
                Sick boy... Sick-em!

     SHE LETS GOT OF THE COLLAR AND CHI-CHI SPRINTS AROUND THE
     CORNER...

     BLAM!

     <i>Choco fires a SHOTGUN BLAST into the floor of the trailer...
     detonating a HOLE in the carpet that is two feet wide.</i>

     CHI-CHI falls YELPING into the hole... cartwheeling down into
     the DARK ABYSS beneath the trailer.

     Domino turns back to Choco and sees that he still has his
     SHOTGUN aimed at the floor. Smoke drifts from the barrels
     into the gloom of the house.

                          CHOCO (SPANISH WITH SUBTITLES)
                <i>FUCK... I MISSED!</i>

     Domino throws him a nod of gratitude anyway. He returns.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                <i>That's my best friend. His name
                is Choco. He's always fancied
                me... but too shy to ever do
                anything about it.</i>

                          EDNA
                Chi-Chi!
                    (desperate beat)
                CHI-CHI!

                          DOMINO
                Chi-Chi has gone to doggie
                heaven, bitch!

     Choco cocks his shotgun for emphasis. SHELLS drop down into
     the abyss. <i>He likes it when Domino talks rough.</i>

                          DOMINO (CONT'D)
                The next one is going to doggie
                hell!

     Ed snaps his fingers... and Choco removes his BACKPACK and
     begins to retrieve something from it.

                          ED
                All we want is the money, Edna!

     Domino looks back at him... waiting for a signal.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                <i>That's Ed Martin. The most
                legendary bounty hunter in all of
                Los Angeles. He's my boss. My
                mentor. The father I never had.</i>

     Edna is now SOBBING loudly.

                          EDNA
                Chi-Chi... my poor Chi-Chi.

     Ed throws Domino a nod. She moves further into the family
     room.

     Edna may have shitty taste... but she isn't poor. Domino
     notices the MITSUBISHI widescreen. Surround Sound. DVD
     Player. <i>The Manchurian Candidate</i> is playing.

                          DOMINO
                <i>The Manchurian Candidate,</i> huh
                Edna?

     In the KITCHEN... Edna leans over and grabs a BUDWEISER
     longneck from a STYRO-FOAM COOLER. With the shotgun still in
     her left hand, she cracks the bottle open with her right and
     takes a long swig.

                          EDNA
                Is that you, Domino?

                          DOMINO
                Nice to see you again, Edna.

     Edna lets out a sly cackle... wiping the bitter tears from
     her face. She is wicked tough... not to mention wicked drunk.
     <i>Age has not been kind to this desert harlot.</i>

                          EDNA
                Your father must be so proud.
                    (beat)
                Look what has become of his
                little angel.

     Ouch. That hit Domino below the belt.

                          DOMINO
                Listen bitch! We've got your son!
                If you don't deliver the money...
                we're gonna wax his fucking ass!

     Edna takes another swig of Budweiser. The RAGE returns.

                          EDNA
                YOU DON'T HAVE SHIT!

     Domino turns back to Choco. He has unwrapped a LARGE OBJECT
     from the backpack. It remains hidden in the shadows. Domino
     stares at it with trepidation. She's in over her head.

     Choco steps forward into the light and we see that the object
     is a SEVERED HUMAN ARM. The BLOODY STUMP ends at the UPPER
     BICEP.

     Choco lobs the arm over the KITCHEN COUNTER and it lands on
     the linoleum floor next to Edna with a loud thump.

                          ED
                Don't fuck with us, Edna! There
                are at least three more limbs
                where that one came from!

                          DOMINO
                I can certainly think of one
                more!

     Edna stares at the severed arm with her mouth twisted into a
     grimace of horror.

     Edna closes her eyes... takes a swig of Budweiser and then
     LEAPS up onto her FEET. She COCKS the shotgun and aims it
     blindly over the counter into the FAMILY ROOM.

                          EDNA
                AAAAAHHHHHHH!!!

     SHE UNLOADS TWO ROUNDS. TWO SHOTGUN BLASTS RIP HOLES IN THE WALL
     BETWEEN ED AND CHOCO. EVERYONE HITS THE GROUND.

     Edna drops back down to the kitchen floor.

     Domino's face is buried into the shag carpet. Her heart is
     pounding.

                          DOMINO
                HE'S STILL ALIVE, EDNA!

                          EDNA
                PROVE IT!

     Domino looks back at Ed... sweat pouring down his face. He
     then motions to Choco... who moves out the front door.
<b>
     EXT. FENDER COMPOUND -- NIGHT
</b>
     Choco comes through the front door of the FENDER HOUSE... a
     one-story RANCHER built from several double-wide trailers.

     The FENDER COMPOUND sits out in the desert near JOSHUA TREE.
     There are JUNKED CARS, BARBED WIRE and SIGNS saying Keep out,
     Private Property, and Beware of Dog. Several FIRES are
     burning in metal barrels... sending smoke signals out across
     the horizon.

     Parked near the GATE of the compound is a large WINNEBAGO.
     Choco unlocks the door and steps inside.
<b>
     INT. WINNEBAGO -- NEXT
</b>
     Inside the winnebago are BRIAN AUSTIN GREEN (30s) and IAN
     ZIERING (40s), former stars of "BEVERLY HILLS, 90210". They are
     both handcuffed and splattered with blood. <i>We will soon learn
     why.</i>

     Next to them sits an AFGHANI MAN named ALF (40s). He is
     eating PIZZA at the kitchen table while watching "WHO WANTS
     TO BE A MILLIONAIRE" on a small television.

                          CHOCO (IN SPANISH WITH SUBTITLES)
                <i>We gotta show Edna her son.</i>

     The Afghani nods his head... waiting for the show contestant
     to answer the question.

                          ALF (IN ARABIC WITH SUBTITLES)
                <i>Eat dick. I'm watching
                Millionaire.</i>

                          CHOCO (IN SPANISH WITH SUBTITLES)
                <i>Raghead.</i>

                          ALF (IN ARABIC WITH SUBTITLES)
                <i>Wetback.</i>

     Alf wipes his mouth and turns to the back of the winnebago.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                <i>That's our driver. He's from
                Afghanistan. He once ate a cat.</i>
                    (beat)
                <i>We can't understand how to
                pronounce his fucking name so we
                just call him Alf. The cat-eating
                alien.</i>

     We see that he is wearing a T-shirt with a picture of ALF (THE
     ORANGE FUR COVERED SITCOM ALIEN) on it.

     Alf disappears behind a curtain. We hear someone moaning from
     back there. Alf mumbles something.

     Choco looks at his watch anxiously. He seems to be under a
     lot of pressure. His clothes are splattered with blood. The
     entire Winnebago is splattered with blood. <i>Some nasty shit
     has transpired.</i>

     Alf emerges from the back of the winnebago with Locus Fender.
     His LEFT ARM is missing. The wound has been sealed with DUCT
     TAPE. He is pale and delirious from the loss of blood.

     Choco helps Alf drag him out of the winnebago.

<b>
     EXT. FENDER COMPOUND -- NEXT
</b>
     Alf and Choco walk Locus toward the front entrance to the
     house. His shoes drag through the sand. Choco coughs at the
     smoke from the burning barrels.
<b>
     INT. VEGAS SECURITY LOCKDOWN -- NIGHT
</b>
     Taryn is scrawling notes on her legal pad.

                          TARYN
                How did Locus Fender lose his
                arm?

                          DOMINO
                He had the combination to the
                safe tattooed on his arm.
<b>
     INT. FENDER HOUSE -- NEXT
</b>
     Choco and Alf arrive in the doorway with LOCUS. He seems to
     be regaining consciousness.

                          LOCUS
                Momma! What'd you do with my
                momma!

                          EDNA
                LOCUS! BABY... I'M HERE!

                          DOMINO
                Turn over your weapon, Edna!

     After another swig of Bud, Edna rises from behind the kitchen
     counter. She throws the shotgun to Domino... who catches it
     with one hand.

                          ED
                    (to Locus)
                Give her the combination to the
                safe or you're gonna be twenty-
                five percent more paraplegic.

     Ed is all business as he places the barrels of his shotgun
     against the man's RIGHT SHOULDER. Locus nods his head slowly.
     <i>He is terrified.</i>

                          LOCUS
                Momma... I need you to <i>say...</i>
                exactly as I do.
                    (slurring)
                The combination code is on the
                wrist... just above the palm.
                You'll need to get the decoder
                from my bedroom.

     Edna turns to move down the hall.

                          DOMINO
                Not so fast!

     Domino moves toward Edna with her gun pointed in her face.

                          DOMINO (CONT'D)
                I'm coming with you.
<b>
     INT. FENDER HOUSE -- BEDROOM -- NEXT
</b>
     Domino follows Edna down the hallway into the BEDROOM. Edna
     immediately begins to rifle through the middle dresser
     drawer. Domino notices a huge VELVET PAINTING of a young Edna
     as a SHOWGIRL hanging above the water bed.

     Edna retrieves a CIRCULAR CARDBOARD DECODER RING. It appears
     to be made out of several PAPER PLATES.

                          DOMINO
                Is that the decoder?

                          EDNA
                Yeah.
<b>
     INT. FENDER HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER
</b>

     Edna now sits in the La-Z-Boy. Ed drops the severed arm into
     her lap. There are NUMBERS and LETTERS TATTOOED ALL OVER IT.
     Ed glances over at a LARGE ANTIQUE SAFE in the corner of the
     trailer.

                          ED
                You have twenty minutes to open
                that safe.

     Edna begins to run her finger along her son's severed arm...
     reading off LETTERS and NUMBERS... turning the WHEEL of the
     DECODER RING.

     Domino drops down onto the couch. She looks exhausted. They
     have been through hell and it shows.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                <i>I've never killed anyone. I hope
                to never kill anyone.
                Even if they deserve it. My
                agenda is to kick ass and secure
                the bounty.</i>

     Ed passes Domino one of Edna's Budweisers and drops down on
     the couch next to her. She takes a long swig.

                          DOMINO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                <i>If I'm on this side of the law...

                <i>That's called the best of both

     The CAMERA moves in toward Domino's face.

                          DOMINO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                <i>As for that other world... that
                90210 world... it's not for me.</i>

     On the TELEVISION... actor LAURENCE HARVEY (40s) appears on
     the screen with FRANK SINATRA and JANET LEIGH.

                          ED
                Is that him?

     Domino nods her head slowly. Choco takes a seat on the other
     side of the couch, popping the cap off his own Budweiser.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                <i>My real father was an actor. He
                died when I was a little girl.</i>

                          ED
                Wow. Laurence Harvey. He knew
                Frank Sinatra?
                    (beat)
                I knew Frank.

     Edna SNORTS sarcastically from the La-Z-Boy.

                          EDNA
                Who didn't?

                          ED
                <i>Shut the fuck up, Edna.</i>
                    (looking at his watch)
                You have seventeen minutes to
                deliver that combination.

     Ed turns back to the screen.

                Is that the bitch from <i>Murder,
                She Wrote?</i>

     They watch the film unfold silently. The CAMERA MOVES in toward
     the Mitsubishi widescreen. <i>The Manchurian Candidate</i> fills the
     screen. ANGELA LANSBURY berates LAURENCE HARVEY.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                <i>You're probably wondering how a

     His ASS is stuck in the small window frame and his legs are
     wiggling back and forth as he tries to pull himself through.

                          DOMINO
                Motherfucker.

     She storms in... grabs Choco from behind just as he drops
     through... RIP!

                To say that Choco is a product of

                No, Choco never had a home.
                Not unless you count the ten or

     Domino rounds the corner of the building into the PARKING LOT...
     just as Choco pushes his way through the window frame and lands
     on the gravel.

     Domino watches Choco as he wipes the dirt from his clothes.
     HEADLIGHTS approach. It is a blue EL CAMINO. Ed is behind the
     wheel.

     The TEAM is on the road to TEXAS in a beat-up CHEVY IMPALA. Alf

                tough. The pressure of the
                tour... relationships within a
                band... sometimes it leads to
                jealousy.

     Ed glances over at Choco. He is dunking a SCREAMING CHILD head
     first into the balls. The kids adore him.

     Domino looks over at Choco in the sea of balls.

     The GROUP sits silently around the CONFERENCE ROOM TABLE. Weiss
     comes into the room.

                          WEISS
                Guys... sorry about the wait...
                I'm having font issues.

     Weiss takes a seat.

                          WEISS (CONT'D)
                Let me just cut to the chase
                here... as I have to take a
                conference call.
                    (switching to "pitch" mode)
                We want to follow you around with
                a camera crew for a week. Our
                pilot episode isn't testing well.
                We've got too many rednecks. It's
                too much like Cops.

                          WEISS (CONT' D)
                We need something sexy...
                something different. We need...
                <i>Domino.</i>

     Ed has his arms folded across his chest.

                          ED
                We won't do it unless the whole
                team gets equal coverage.

                          SOPHIE
                You're not her father, Ed. No one
                cares what you think.

                          ED
                It can't be just her. We're a
                team and we work together.

     Weiss smiles at them all.

                          WEISS
                Sure. Okay. We'll follow the
                whole team.

     Sophie sighs loudly.

                          SOPHIE
                Mark... what guarantee can you
                give us that Domino's name won't
                be tarnished?

                          WEISS
                Sophie... this is reality
                television. What you see is what
                you get.

                          SOPHIE
                But you can edit things... add
                sound-bytes... fabricate <i>this</i>...
                exaggerate <i>that</i>. These programs
                are all about shock value. It
                won't be long before someone gets
                killed.

                          WEISS
                I'm just giving America what it
                wants to see. People are tired of
                fiction. They want reality.

     Sophie turns to Domino.

                          SOPHIE
                You <i>will</i> be exploited. Your story
                will <i>not</i> be told accurately. Your
                life will <i>never</i> be the same.
                    (taking Domino's hand)
                <i>I beg you not to take part in
                this drivel.</i>

                    (holding up her other hand to
                     Weiss)
                No offense Mark... but we both
                know that this is <i>drivel.</i>

     Weiss smiles bitterly. The TELEPHONE rings.

                          WEISS
                None taken.
                    (holding up his hand)
                Talk it over. I have to take this
                conference call.

     Weiss hits the SPEAKERPHONE button.

                          WEISS (CONT'D)
                Cynthia... you changed the
                fucking font on the promo. <i>Why?</i>

     As Cynthia babbles on with some shitty excuse... Domino and the
     others are quietly debating their decision.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                <i>I felt like a hypocrite, given my
                hatred of all things Hollywood.
                But I'll admit... I wanted my
                story told. I wanted everyone to
                know the things I'd done. I
                wanted some recognition in the
                world.</i>

                          DOMINO (CONT'D)
                We'll do it.

     Weiss smiles at Domino... giving her the thumbs up. He hits the
     button on the speakerphone.

                          SOPHIE
                God help us. God help us all.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                <i>It was the beginning of the end.</i>

     The CAMERA MOVES in toward Domino's face.
<b>
     EXT. RV DEALERSHIP -- EARLY MORNING

     [FATBOY SLIM -- THE WEEKEND STARTS HERE]
</b>
     HUNDREDS of WINNEBAGOS stretch out into an endless parking lot.
     A GIGANTIC AMERICAN FLAG billows in the wind above them all.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                <i>On Wednesday morning, Kimmie took
                us to buy a new winnebago for Alf
                to drive. Fox wasn't too keen on
                the Impala. They wanted something
                that could house a camera crew.</i>

     In the PARKING LOT... Domino, Ed, Choco, Kimmie and the RV
     DEALER watch as Alf recklessly maneuvers a WINNEBAGO through a
     series of CONES set up on the ASPHALT.

                          RV DEALER
                    (cringing)
                This vehicle isn't intended for
                high speeds and intense turns.
                It's for recreational use...
                vacations...

     The Winnebago skids around the last cone as Alf pulls a sudden
     U-turn... the back end of the RV fishtailing counter-clockwise.

                          DOMINO
                We aren't going on vacation.

     The Winnebago comes skidding to a stop. Alf jumps out... shrugs
     his shoulders and raises his THUMB.

                          KIMMIE
                We'll take it.
<b>
     EXT. DOWNTOWN GARAGE ROOFTOP -- MIDDAY

</b>
     A CADILLAC ESCALADE pulls up to the top of a PARKING GARAGE
     overlooking DOWNTOWN. IAN ZIERING (30s) and BRIAN AUSTIN GREEN
     (30s) emerge from inside.

                          ZIERING
                We're late.

                          GREEN
                Fucking Map Quest. <i>Never again.</i>
<b>
     EXT. DOWNTOWN GARAGE ROOFTOP -- NEXT
</b>
     Ziering and Green approach a LARGE TENT. The WINNEBAGO is parked
     off to the side. Alf is inside... doing something with a WELDER
     on the front of the RV.

     Under the tent... Domino and her team are lounging on several
     COUCHES... watching television. There is a CRAFT SERVICE
     TABLE... WARDROBE... MAKE-UP and a CAMERA CREW milling about.
     Mark Weiss is talking with Kimmie when he notices Ziering and
     Green.

                          WEISS
                Hey guys! I want you to meet
                Domino.

     Weiss walks them over to Domino. The CAMERA CREW follows.

                          WEISS (CONT'D)
                Domino... I want you to meet the
                co-hosts of Bounty Hunters... Ian
                Ziering and Brian Austin Green.

     In SLOW MOTION... Green shakes Domino's hand. She regards him
     with awe... <i>her eyes wide like saucers.</i>

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                <i>Fucking 90210. I couldn't get
                away from it.</i>

     Domino shakes hands with Green.

                          DOMINO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                <i>It wasn't until later on that I
                realized mum had gotten to Weiss
                and pulled some strings.</i>

     Ziering and Green smile politely as they shake hands with Choco
     and Ed. Choco is nervous... refusing to make eye contact.

                          ZIERING
                We're ready whenever you are,
                Mark.

     Weiss puts his hand on Domino's shoulder.

                          WEISS
                The guys are going to conduct
                some interviews.

     Kimmie approaches with a sense of anxiety.

                          KIMMIE
                Mark... uh... the gentleman from
                Afghanistan has done some...
                significant alterations to the
                RV.

     The GROUP turns its attention to the Winnebago.

     ON THE RIGHT SIDE of the vehicle... Alf has AIRBRUSHED a
     GIGANTIC AFGHANISTAN NATIONAL FLAG. Standing in front of the
     flag are three AIRBRUSHED WOMEN IN AMERICAN FLAG BIKINIS
     teaching an AFGHANI WOMAN how to dance. She is wearing an
     AFGHANI FLAG BIKINI.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                <i>Alf grew up during the Russian
                invasion of Afghanistan. He had
                always wanted to be part of the
                revolution... but it seemed to
                pass him by.</i>
<b>
     EXT. AFGHANISTAN -- [FLASHBACK] 1979
</b>
     ALF (17) sits on a rock on the outskirts of a small village in
     Afghanistan. A RUSSIAN TANK blows past. Alf holds up an M-16.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                <i>At the tender age of seventeen he
                decided that explosives would be
                his specialty.</i>

<b>
     EXT. AFGHANISTAN VILLAGE -- DAYS LATER
</b>
     <b>IMAGE BLEED:</b> Alf rigging DYNAMITE with make-shift fuses... a
     group of KIDS (8-12) watch him curiously... ALF stands before an
     abandoned HOUSE rigging the fuse to a DETONATOR... The KIDS
     surrounding him back away.

     Alf goes to retrieve the fuses from the dirt and drops the
     detonator... setting off a HUGE EXPLOSION that obliterates the
     house... his body goes flying as he is nearly engulfed in
     flames.

     As DEBRIS rains down, Alf just lays there in the dirt... his
     eyebrows singed off. The Kids approach him curiously.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                <i>His eyebrows never grew back.</i>
<b>
     EXT. DOWNTOWN GARAGE ROOFTOP -- NEXT
</b>
     Weiss moves around to the front of the Winnebago. Alf has
     MOUNTED several HUMAN SKULLS as HOOD ORNAMENTS on the vehicle.
     Various HUMAN BONES are attached to the HOOD in an ORNATE
     DESIGN.

                          WEISS
                Are those... <i>real bones?</i>

     Alf nods his head politely.

                          ALF
                For my family.
                    (beat)
                I drive these bounty hunters...
                for a free Afghanistan.

     Ziering looks at Green in shock.

                          ZIERING
                Whoa. I didn't know this was a
                political show.

     Weiss bites his fingernails.

                          WEISS
                I think... that the network is
                going to have some notes... about
                the RV.

     Domino puts her hand on Weiss's shoulder.

                          DOMINO
                <i>No notes.</i> This is our Winnebago.
                It stays like this... or I walk.

     Weiss sees that she means business.

                          WEISS
                Okay.

     Alf nods his head to Weiss with a look of gratitude.

     Green.

                So... how'd you get the name

                I am here today to speak for all
                people of mixed race in America.
                As a Blacktino woman, I believe
                that we deserve our own race
                category... so that we can forge
                an identity.

                mixed race. I have struggled my
                whole life as to whether I am

     HIP-HOP BLARES as two LOW RENT CHIPPENDALES REJECTS waltz across
     the stage with Lateesha's FLOW CHART. On it... she has created
     CATEGORIES for each variation of BLACK/HISPANIC/ASIAN descent
     and their SUB-CATEGORIES.

                          LATEESHA
                Blacktino... Blackasian...
                Hispasian... and the Asian sub-
                categories... Chinegro...
                Koreagro... Japegro...
                Chispanic... Koreaspanic... and
                last but not least... Japanic.

     Outrage from the crowd.

                          RICKI
                You believe that our government
                should recognize these racial sub-
                categories?

                          LATEESHA
                Yes.

     Ricki shoves her mike in the face of an OUTRAGED BLACK WOMAN.

                          OUTRAGED BLACK WOMAN
                These sub-categories are racist.
                You're excluding all of the mixed
                race people who have more than
                two racial identities. People
                like Mariah Carey and Vin Diesel.
                Where is their category?

                          LATEESHA
                This is only the beginning. We
                must appeal to the United Nations
                to create categories for every
                permutation of mixed race
                individual.

     More outrage from the crowd. A BLACKTINO WOMAN grabs the mike
     from Ricki.

                          BLACKTINO WOMAN
                First of all... from one
                Blacktino woman to another... our
                concern is not these ridiculous
                categories. Our concern is
                education and family planning.
                Here you are a 28 year-old
                grandmother. You need to add
                another category to your flow
                chart... <i>it's called birth
                control, bitch!</i>

     Blacktino Woman SNAPS her fingers. The crowd goes wild.

                At 5:23 AM you'll see that the
                armored truck pulled into the
                parking lot and turned off its
                engine.

     ON THE MONITOR... the armored truck parks. Four MEN wearing
     MASKS emerge from the front and back. A BLACK VAN backs up to
     face the rear of the truck. The Masked Men quickly unload FOUR
     LARGE DUFFEL BAGS from the armored truck and throw them into the
     back of the van. They jump into the van... and it speeds off.

     (NOTE: How is money transported in an armored vehicle)

     Bishop and Beckett stare at the tape in silent outrage.

     Bishop raises a SINGLE GLOVED FINGER in Beckett's direction as
     if to say... <i>NOT ANOTHER FUCKING PEEP.</i> Cudlitz smiles
     nervously... giving the Security Guy a look that says... <i>HURRY
     THE FUCK UP AND DO IT.</i>

     ON THE MONITOR... the image reveals the identity of the MASK.

                          BISHOP

     It is indeed a BARBARA BUSH MASK made of rubber. Cudlitz points

                You will regret this, Domino.

     Domino retrieves her lucky SILVER DOLLAR from the table...
     flipping it through her fingers. sophie grabs her daughters
     chin... forcing eye contact with her.

                But I hate shopping, mum. It's

     Sophie sighs.

     The GOLDFISH floats on the surface of the toilet water. She
     then flushes the toilet... as the dead goldfish disappears down
     into the vortex... into the ABYSS OF SHIT.

     That was it. The STRAW... the CAMEL... the BROKEN BACK.

     Choco LUNGES at Ed and throws him to the ground. PUNCHES...
     KICKS... you name it... they're doing it.

                there and whup your girlfriend.

     Choco CLOCKS Ed in the face. Ed falls to the ground. Choco grabs
     a CHAIR, moves to strike, but Ed thwarts him by pulling his GUN.

     They stare at one another.

                don't say a word, Spanish or

     Choco slowly lowers the chair to the ground. Ed gets up, sits on
     it. Choco tries to talk but Ed checks him with his gun.

                something about it?

                Oh! And another thing. I am a

     into the sand... vomiting.

     It's not until the Angel envelops her with his arms and lifts
     her from the sand that his face becomes clear. It is Choco.

                          CHOCO
                You are not alone.

     As TIME AND SPACE shift and change all around, they hold on to
     one another for dear life. From this embrace, they begin to
     kiss... undressing one another. They begin to have CRAZY SEX.

                                                       FADE TO BLACK:

     Domino is being cradled by Choco. He is pouring BOTTLED WATER
     over her head. Stroking her hair gently. The WIND whistles
     through the early morning light.

                          CHOCO
                You are cleansed.

     <i>Domino's eyes flutter open. This is the first time Choco has
     spoken English to Domino.</i> Alf and Ed are standing there...
     bloody and bruised.

                          CHOCO (CONT'D)
                She's awake.

     The Winnebago lays turned over in the sand. Ziering and Green
     lean up against it. Green has an ICE PACK on his head. ziering
     is bleeding from several outs.

                          ZIERING
                Someone's coming!

     Ziering points WEST. A RED FORD PICKUP TRUCK approaches on a
     TINY DESERT SIDE ROAD. The Red Truck stops... and an old INDIAN
     MAN, the WANDERER (70s), steps out.

     The Wanderer slowly approaches the group. Domino is standing
     there with Ed, Choco and Alf.

     He stares at them for a long moment... studying them.

                          WANDERER
                If you do not return this money,
                you will all die.
                    (pointing to Domino)
                You are the angel of fire. You
                burn bright enough to know that
                sometimes certain sacrifices must
                be made.

     Domino just stares out at the vast expanse of desert earth. The
     Wanderer's voice echoes through her head.

                          WANDERER (CONT'D)
                A great puzzle has formed. Within
                the puzzle... there is a child. A
                sick child. She will grow up to
                be great world leader some day.
                    (beat)
                Do you know what child I speak
                of?

                          DOMINO
                Yes.

                          WANDERER
                Your destiny is this: <i>You must
                be willing to offer your lives in

                child.</i>

                    (beat)
                Only then will you truly be
                cleansed in the eyes of God.

                          CHOCO
                Will we survive this sacrifice?

                          WANDERER
                    (beat)
                Only one of you will survive.

     Choco stares at the others... his fingers intertwined with
     Domino's.

                          ED
                Which one of us?

                          WANDERER
                That I do not know.

     Domino retrieves the S!LVER DOLLAR from her pocket. she looks at
     the others... then back at the Wanderer.

                          DOMINO

                This is your last chance. Tell us
                everything you know.

     Domino lights a cigarette. Her strength has returned.

                Do you want know the real reason
                why I became a bounty hunter?

                          TARYN
                No. Please enlighten me.

                          DOMINO
                I became a bounty hunter because
                of cunts like you.
                    (beat)
                I remember all the cunts in high
                school who were mean to me.
                Eventually... they all grew up to
                be just like you. Angry and
                bitter because they peaked
                early... and now they're stuck in
                some dead end marriage... or
                worse yet... an unfulfilling job
                that keeps them from meeting a
                man.

     Domino stares her up and down... taking a drag from her
     Marlboro.

                          DOMINO (CONT'D)
                But that's not the case with you,
                is it Taryn? Because I bet when
                you go to sleep alone tonight...
                it's my pussy you'll be dreaming
                of.

     Taryn looks legitimately turned on... but she's too tough to
     lose track.

                          TARYN
                We discovered the bodies early

     Ziering, Green and Alf struggle with the DUFFEL BAGS... getting
     them into the TRUNK of a CAB. Alf closes the trunk. He makes eye
     contact with the ARABIC DRIVER of the cab.

     Another CAB pulls up into the valet entrance. Another Arabic
     driver. Alf seems to know him. The driver throws him an Afghani
     salute.

     Domino comes out into the valet area with Ed and Choco.

                          ALF
                You take that cab, we take this

     fingers.

     Drake Bishop turns from the PICTURE WINDOWS that overlook the
     entire strip. He looks Domino up and down.

                Welcome to the Top of the World.
                I thought privacy might be in

                business that we're conducting.

     Bishop glances at Alf... who is SWEATING PROFUSELY... then at
     Ziering and Green. He approaches the actors... sizing them up.

                          BISHOP (CONT'D)
                Where have I seen you two before?

     Sweat pours down Ziering's face.

                They think you won't kill them if
                we're in the room. People don't
                kill other people... when there
                are celebrities present.

                downstairs then.

     Bishop nods his head to two of the goons. They grab Ziering and
     Green and take them away. Green throws Domino a fleeting glance
     as he walks away.

     Bishop turns back to face Domino.

                Is it a dangerous profession?

                          DOMINO
                Sometimes.

                          BISHOP
                Can you be more specific?

     Domino thinks for a moment.

                          DOMINO
                It can be dangerous when you
                don't know what to expect from a

     Alf fumbles for the keys to the locks on the bags. Bishop takes
     a puff from his cigar... assessing Domino once again.

     The GOONS begin to unzip the DUFFEL BAGS... <i>retrieving stack
