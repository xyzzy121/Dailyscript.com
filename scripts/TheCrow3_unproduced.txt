			  THE CROW 3: RESURRECTION

				Written by

Revised draft
April 19, 1997

FADE IN:

CAMERA flies over the twisted maze of a DARK PORT CITY.

				WOMAN'S VOICE
			There's a legend that when a body
			dies, a crow comes to escort its
			soul to the next world.

NEW ANGLE - FLYING CROW

				WOMAN'S VOICE
				(continuing)
			If death has come through violence
			or treachery, and if the soul is
			pure, sometimes the crow can
			return the soul to its body so
			that Justice can be done... even
			from beyond the grave.

The crow begins to descend.

				WOMAN'S VOICE
				(continuing)
			But the legend never answers one
			question: What happens when the
			soul dies... but the body doesn't?

The crow lands on a PIER-SIDE PILING. CAMERA WIDENS.

EXT. SAN FRANCISCO BAY - A PIER - DAY

A CARGO SHIP glides into a berth, horn BLASTING a warning.
CAMERA FEATURES two hard looking SAILORS who move to the
rail, look down at -

THE PIER - A CAR

Where four MEN - TERRELL, ACER, BRUNO, and MORGAN stand,
expectant. They're all too well dressed for this seedy
locale and its almost Third World clientele. They
exchange a look with the sailors. Terrell points to his
watch. As they move toward where the gangway will be
lowered, they pass a man whose cheap flashy clothing is
equally out of place in the thick of the hard working
pier crowd. This is the aptly-named FINDER and, in fact,
he has just found Terrell and Co.

Finder NODS across the dock to a scruffy looking homeless
COUPLE (a MAN and a WOMAN) carrying ratty fishing gear.
They nod back.

As Terrell and Co. proceed down the pier, they almost
collide with the homeless couple. Their BUCKET spills
fish and scummy water all over Terrell's shoes.

				HOMELESS MAN
			S-sorry, sir - didn't see you-

Terrell's eyes flash fury. We sense he is controlling his
temper when all he does is roughly smash the homeless
couple aside and lead the others toward the ship.

THE HOMELESS COUPLE

share a smile. As Finder passes by them, the man slips him
a wad of bills, then hits a hidden button, speaks into a
tiny microphone.

				MAN (KATO)
			This is Kato. We made them. It's
			Terrell all right. Acer and two
			others are with him.

AT A ROACH COACH - INTERCUT AS NEEDED

The man behind the counter, GOMEZ, speaks into his throat
mike. Next to him sits another undercover cop, ROSSI.

				GOMEZ
			Can you maintain eye contact?

				KATO
			Yes, but it isn't necessary. You
			can smell them a mile away.

A TOURIST IN A HAWAIIAN SHIRT - ALSO INTERCUT

at a dime-a-peek binocular stand, he's watching this from
the end of the pier. But he ain't no tourist, he's CAPTAIN
WYKOFF and he's their boss.

				WYKOFF
			Very funny, Kato, but last I
			checked you weren't with the K-9
			unit. We just got a tip from
			Interpol that Terrell's moving out
			of street drugs and into designer
			stuff. Working for Lucien Raynor.

				HOMELESS WOMAN (SARAH)
			Lucien Raynor? The number-one bio-
			hack in the world? That guy can
			make molecules tap dance in a test
			tube.

				KATO
			Yeah? The sixty people who died
			in Holland from Raynor's acid
			aren't dancing.

				ROSSI
				(looking up)
			They're going up on board. C'mon,
			Gomez. Time to ship up and shape
			out.

				GOMEZ
			That's shape up and ship out.

				ROSSI
			Stuff it, Gomez. The closest you
			ever got to the navy was your
			rubber ducky.

The cops inside the Roach Coach check their pistols and
hidden mikes, jump out, begin to glide across the dock.
That's when

A LOAD OF CRATED GEESE

falls off a vehicle and SMASHES onto the ground. The birds
begin squawking and honking all over the dock, to the
frustration of the longshoremen and the amusement of the
crowd.

WIDER

As people and vehicles scramble to avoid or capture the
birds, the pier jams up. The cops try and cut through the
suddenly chaotic scene.

KATO AND SARAH

				KATO
				(into mike)
			Come on, you guys, come on,
			they're aboard-

				ROSSI
			We're coming, we're coming...
			somebody's dinner is in the way!

Kato and Sarah look up at -

THE STEAMER

Terrell and the others are at the top of the gangway.
They've been met by the two sailors and they're about
to go inside the ship.

BACK TO SCENE

				KATO
			We're gonna lose them! We're
			going aboard!

Kato and Sarah run forward.

WYKOFF

				WYKOFF
				(yells into his mike)
			Damn it, you two, wait for backup!

				SARAH
			We lose them inside that ship
			we'll never see the hand-off!

KATO

as he and Sarah run along the dock they see that they'll
never reach the distant gangway in time to catch up. Then
Kato notices a CARGO NET full of supplies just now rising
from the pier. He tugs Sarah's sleeve.

				KATO
			Come on. Express elevator.

				SARAH
			Oh, no - You're a lunatic!

But she follows him. They both jump, catch the webbing and
soar upwards.

ON THE DOCK

Wykoff has run forward and caught up with the rest of his
team who have finally cut through the crowd.

				WYKOFF
			Kato, I'm warning you - watch that
			kung fu shit! I want these perps
			in one piece so they can testify!

KATO AND SARAH - ON THE NET

Kato grins at Sarah, speaks into his mike.

				KATO
				(into his mike)
			Aw, gee, Captain, I was hoping to
			try out my new move.... the Kung
			Pow Brain drain.

				WYKOFF'S VOICE
			The Kung Pow Brain drain?

				KATO
			Yeah. That's where you reach into
			a guy's eyeballs and pull out his
			brain.

				WYKOFF'S VOICE
			Are you bullshitting me?
				(worried)
			You're bullshitting me, aren't you?

				SARAH
				(to Kato)
			Why do you always jerk him off?

				KATO
			What else do you do with a dick...?

He looks down.

TERRELL AND COMPANY

as they disappear into a hold.

BACK TO SCENE

He and Sarah jump, hit the deck rolling. Head toward
the hold.

ON THE PIER

Gomez and Rossi run up the gangway. Wykoff stays on the
dock to cover their rear.

IN THE HOLD

Dark, echo-y, with slivers of light coming through poorly
maintained vents. There's a constant CLANK as CRATES grind
their way up into daylight on a rolling bar conveyor belt
coming from below. Terrell and his companions are being
handed several hermetically sealed BOXES by the two sailors.
Suddenly Kato slides into view, entering via a deck vent.

				KATO
			San Francisco Police! Freeze!

WIDER

The men instantly turn, FIRE.

BACK TO SCENE

Their bullets rip up decking where Kato had been standing.
He has literally moved in the blink of an eye.

THE CONFUSED GUNMEN

blink... where did he go? A SHADOW clues them in, too late.
Whoosh! Kato comes sailing in from above, somersaulting
in mid-air to deliver HEAD KICKS to the two sailors as he
lands. They're smashed aside, unconscious before they hit
the deck.

TERRELL AND HIS PARTNERS

AIM at Kato - he's a goner - then - BLAM! BLAM! Morgan is
CUT DOWN. The others turn.

AT THE DOOR

Sarah has fired the shot. As Terrell and Acer return
SHOTS she ducks out of harm's way.

BACK TO SCENE

Kato grabs a crate from the conveyor belt, holds it chest
high, CHARGES the men firing at Sarah! BULLETS splinter
the wood, shred the crate - but it holds until he's on top
of them and he slams them with it! Acer and Bruno fall but
Terrell breaks free, grabbing two of the hermetic boxes
and running up a ladder.

Kato starts to follow but a KICK from Bruno knocks him
off balance. Bruno - twice as big as Kato - grabs the
next crate, SMASHES it down!

ON DECK - OUTSIDE THE HOLD

Sarah suddenly finds herself outflanked by Terrell and
Acer. She has to retreat and they make a break for it.

IN THE HOLD

Bruno's big hands sweep aside wood and splinters. But
Kato isn't under the box! Bruno turns, too late. Kato
flies in at head height, kicks Bruno into a wall. Both
men land, recover. And then - with three quick blows...
Kato kills Bruno, the whole thing over in a ballet of
death as brief as a heartbeat. Before Bruno's body has
hit the floor Kato has crashed out the door into daylight.

ON DECK

Rossi and Gomez come running aft from the gangway, right
into Terrell and Acer's view. There's a flurry of SHOTS
that send the crew panicking. Terrell hits Gomez, who falls.
Sarah, coming up from the rear, is the first at Gomez's side.

				GOMEZ
			I'm okay, go, go!

They start after the criminals, Gomez trailing. But Sarah
heads backwards, face worried - until she sees

KATO

intact, running forward. Even fifty yards away, his eyes
show the question: Where are they?

SARAH

relieved that Kato's alright, she signals: Who the fuck
knows? She points to where they were last seen, forward.
Suddenly a SOUND makes her whirl, gun ready.

NEW ANGLE

It's a WINCH spinning so quickly it's smoking. CAMERA
RAKES as Sarah looks around - SEES a big metal CONTAINER
dropping rapidly toward the dock. She ducks aside as it
just misses both her and the ship's railing.

ON THE DOCK

People run screaming as the SHADOW gives them a moment's
warning. WHAM! The container CRASHES onto the pier.

ANOTHER ANGLE

with a ROAR a new CAR, stickers still in place, crashes
out of the container and roars down the pier, Acer driving,
Terrell beside him!

SARAH

				SARAH
			Shit!

Rossi and Gomez come alongside of her. They all realize
that by the time they make their way forward to the
gangway the car will be long gone. But they try anyway.

				SARAH
				(continuing; turning)
			Kato! Come on!

They run for the gangway. CAMERA ADJUSTS to tilt down and
show Wykoff, futilely FIRING at the rapidly distancing
vehicle.

KATO

Still further back, he starts forward - then suddenly
stops. The fleeing car is about to pass beneath him.
He looks around. Just below the rail here is one of the
ship's thick mooring cables. Kato takes a deep breath...
and runs down the cable!

THE OTHER COPS

see this move. They're all amazed... except for Sarah,
who just grins.

				SARAH
			That's my partner.

KATO - LONG SHOT

He makes it to the bottom before he loses his balance.
At the last minute he dives for the dock, landing on a
startled longshoremen's pallet.

Ignoring the cursing man, Kato jumps to the top of the
fork-lift for a better view.

HIS POV

The smuggler's car is about to leave the pier.

BACK TO SCENE

				KATO
				(showing badge)
			Police emergency. I need your
			vehicle.

And he tosses the guy out! Jumping into the seat, he guns
the fork-lift and chugs forward.

THE DOCK

The fork-lift crashes through boxes, crates, and fruit.
Hearing the horn, people jump out of the way.

WIDER

He's not going to catch the car. Even now it is going
through the gate.

BACK TO SCENE

Kato hits the fork-lift control, raising the forks to the
highest level. He drives straight for the fence. Just
before it hits he leaps from his seat up to the forks.
When the fork-lift CRASHES into the fence, Kato is jet
propelled over the top of it!

OTHER SIDE OF THE FENCE

Kato flies through the air like one of the X-men, lands on

THE ROOF OF THE CAR

				TERRELL
			What was that?

				ACER
			What was wha-

He doesn't finish "what" because Kato has leaned down,
opened the door, and tossed him out!

Terrell starts to draw his pistol, but Kato swings into
the car feet first. Terrell falls onto the car floor,
momentarily stunned. Kato grabs the wheel. Looks up.

HIS POV

He's about to crash through the guardrail above the
coast road!

BACK TO SCENE

He hits the brakes. Nothing happens. He looks down.

FLOORBOARD - HIS POV

Terrell's body is covering the pedals. His foot is on
his hand.

BACK TO SCENE

Kato tries to keep one hand on the wheel while he uses
the other to haul the guy out of the way. It ain't easy.

WIDER

At the last possible second Kato hits the brakes. The
car burns rubber, almost skids over the cliff!

UP ANGLE

The front wheels go over the edge!

AT THE CAR

Kato catches his breath, gets out of the car, starts to
relax... and that's when an arm goes around his neck!

NEW ANGLE

It's Terrell, conscious again, and rather pissed. As he
tries to choke Kato, Kato grabs his forearm, flips him
over his head and onto the car roof.

UP ANGLE - FROM BELOW

The car teeters and groans from the impact... begins to
tilt over the cliff.

SIDE ANGLE

The tilting vehicle and Terrell's unrelenting grip combine
to drag Kato onto the car roof.

HIGH ANGLE - LOOKING DOWN

The car teeters even more. Terrell has to release Kato to
keep himself from falling. Gasping for breath, Kato also
hangs on. Each man tries to improve his position, but even
the slightest move sets the car rocking again. Still, Kato
inches his way closer to the rear seat, slowly reaches for
the box below.

INSIDE THE CAR

Kato leans over, gets his hand close to the box - and
that's when something INSIDE the box squirms and HISSES.

UP ABOVE

Startled, Kato recoils - and gets a kick in the face from
Terrell, who has slid down the car roof. As Kato goes off
the roof, he slides toward the edge -his weight tips the car-

TERRELL

DIVES FOR THE GROUND. As the car ROLLS OVER with a groan
of metal, the box slides along the car seat. Terrell
snatches it and runs up to a startled driver who has
paused on the shoulder to watch this scene. Terrell flings
the guy away, jumps in his car and roars down the ramp!

RESUME KATO

The car is still teetering downward. Kato scrambles like
a spider over the hood and windshield, but as he labors
up the car undercarriage groans and buckles. Just when
we think he's going to make it the car goes over all the
way. Kato falls just behind it.

LOW ANGLE - SHOOTING UP

At the last second Kato grabs a handhold on a branch and
hangs five stories up.

TERRELL - IN THE ESCAPING CAR

Comes roaring out of the last switchback below the cliff,
nearly causing an accident with an oncoming car. He looks
up - SLAMS the brakes on.

WIDER

The car from above EXPLODES in front of him. Terrell leans
out of the window, looks up.

KATO - SLO-MO

About to lose his grip... and then with his remaining
strength he kicks his legs up like a gymnast, gets one
ankle over the edge of the cliff! As he does, the violent
gesture makes something flip out of his pocket. It's

A HOTEL KEY

we follow it as it falls and falls and falls -

-right into TERRELL'S OUTSTRETCHED HAND.

Terrell

has just enough time to look at it when he hears SIRENS.
He looks ahead down the road... SEES POLICE CARS racing
toward him.

CONTINUED -

He hits the gas and escapes.

UP ABOVE

Kato's been running and fighting for twenty minutes. He's
battered, bruised, and on the verge of falling. He's one
hand hold away from safety - he lunges for a grip - and
MISSES.

CLOSER

At the last second a HAND grabs his wrist - Sarah's hand.
We WIDEN as she leans back to haul him up. Wykoff appears
a second later and helps.

Uniformed COPS appear behind them, fan out and search the
area.

				SARAH
			You all right?

				KATO
			Yeah.
				(turning to Wykoff)
			What's the damage to the Unit?

				WYKOFF
			The Unit's fine, thanks to you.
			Gomez is wounded, but it's just
			a scratch...

				SARAH
			How the hell did this happen?

				KATO
			Somebody talked, that's how it
			happened.

				SARAH
			Somebody with a badge is picking
			up drug money.

				KATO
			It wasn't drugs. That box they
			delivered- It was... alive.

				SARAH
			Alive?

				WYKOFF
			We'll sort this out with our
			Federal Friends. I'm gonna tear
			them a new asshole.

				KATO
			You'll have to wait in line.

				SARAH
			Uh, partner, I think it'll have
			to wait... Remember?

She steps closer, lowers her already husky voice.

				SARAH
				(continuing)
			Little soiree we're both attending?
				(on his look)
			Do wedding bells ring a bell?

Kato laughs, puts his arm around her.

				KATO
			I gotta stop working the night
			shift.

								CUT TO:

IN AN ALLEY - ON THAT MYSTERIOUS BOX--DAY

swaying as Terrell walks with it. TILT UP. Terrell calms
himself as he walks, slowly controls his breathing. He
wipes blood from the corner of his mouth, goes to a
prearranged spot. SOUND from nearby. He has his pistol
out before he realizes that it's ACER. Both he and his
clothes are beat up from their earlier collision with
the asphalt.

				ACER
			You made it, too.

				TERRELL
			I always make it. Where's
			Einstein?

Acer tilts his head, points with his chin -

NEW ANGLE

A car pulls up alongside them. They get in. The driver
burns rubber.

IN THE CAR - MOVING

the driver, PRING, has various religious medallions
hanging from his rear view mirror.

				PRING
			So where're the others?
				(off their looks)
			Shit. Ashes to ashes, dust to
			dust.

				VOICE
			My property, gentlemen. Now.

CAMERA RAKES as Terrell turns, hands the box to the MAN
in the back seat, the man Wykoff called Lucien Raynor.
But forget the name Wykoff used; this man has too many
passports for it to matter. We'll call him BYRON.

He looks like your basic mad scientist - eccentric
clothes, Tim Burton hairdo, out of style glasses. He
strokes the box, coos to it.

				BYRON
			There you are, my precious. Miss
			me? Daddy's going to take good,
			good care of you. And you're
			going to take good care of daddy,
			aren't you -
				(suddenly)
			She's bleeding! She's bleeding!

				TERRELL
			We got our asses kicked, Byron.
			We all got a few knocks!

				ACER
				(sotto)
			Some of us got knocked into the
			fucking hereafter.

				PRING
			Lo, I show you a good thing.
			Receive it.

				BYRON
				(to the box)
			There, there, you'll be just fine,
			Daddy will make it all better.
				(in the same tone)
			Another such victory and we are
			undone. I'm not happy, Terrell.
			What will make it all better?

				TERRELL
			Getting even.

As Byron smiles, he holds up the KEY he caught earlier.
It's a HOTEL KEY.

								CUT TO:

EXT. BAY AREA HOTEL - DAY

CAMERA HOLDS on the elegant SIGN identifying the hotel.
PAN to reveal the park-like GROUNDS and the OUTDOOR
CEREMONY.

We're in a dramatic, outdoor setting that nonetheless
affords a glimpse in the distance of San Francisco.
We're TIGHT on a CATHOLIC PRIEST.

				PRIEST
			And do you, John Kato, take this
			woman to be your lawfully wedded
			wife, to have and to hold, from
			this day forward, as long as you
			both shall live?

				KATO
			I do.

CAMERA continues pulling back revealing the bride, ANNE.

				PRIEST
			And do you, Anne Lotus Lee, take
			this man to be your lawfully wedded
			husband, to have and hold...

As she says her part, the CAMERA finds Sarah. She is not
the bride. She is in one of the front rows of folding
chairs. She's smiling, but there's something behind the
teeth that she's fighting to keep inside.

RESUME PRIEST

				PRIEST
			Then by the power vested in me by
			the State of California, I now
			declare you man and wife. You may
			now -

Kato is already ahead of him. As he kisses Anne a CHEER
goes up.

								CUT TO:

WEDDING PARTY - LATER

People are dancing to a small orchestra.

A ROWDY TABLE

Where Sarah kibitzes with Wykoff, Rossi and Gomez. Gomez
has one arm in a sling that matches his tie and cummerbund.

				WYKOFF
			I'd like to propose a toast. Not
			to the bride and groom, they had
			enough. This one's to the best man.

				ROSSI
			Thank you.

				GOMEZ
				(to Rossi)
			Hey, I'm the best man.

				ROSSI
			Your wife says different.

Rowdy laughter.

				SARAH
				(to Rossi)
			Then she hasn't seen you with the
			lights on.
				(as everyone laughs)
			Let's drink to the new couple.

WIDER ANGLE

Revealing the bridal party's table. We see that Anne's
mother is a beautiful, very proper (and very wealthy)
doyenne of San Francisco's Chinese community. There's
even a MONSIGNOR at the table.

				SARAH
				(continued, standing)
			Kato. Anne. We wish you
			happiness. Love. Family. Anne,
			he's yours to have and hold
			forever. But when he sits in my
			patrol car his ass is still mine.

She tosses back the drink to a huge LAUGH.

CLOSE ON THE BRIDAL TABLE

As Kato and Anne laugh, Anne's mother squirms. The
Monsignor turns to her.

				MONSIGNOR
				(quietly)
			His friends are... a lively bunch.
			What do they do?

				ANNE'S MOTHER
			They do... legal work. Special
			cases. International law.

				MONSIGNOR
				(impressed)
			Really?

				ANNE
				(hearing this,
				 leaning over)
			They're policemen, Monsignor. A
			special anti-smuggling team. But
			Mother thinks it sounds more
			impressive her way.

				ANNE'S MOTHER
			Anne, please, not here -

				ANNE
			He's a policeman, Mother. And
			I'm a policeman's wife.

She rises with Kato, moves with him toward his friends.

FAVORING KATO

				KATO
				(raising a glass)
			My turn, you idiots. Before we
			fly off to Singapore for five
			fabulous days and nights...
				(CATCALLS and
				 WHISTLES)
			... I have to say I'm impressed by
			your behavior. Rossi, you only
			molested three of the bridesmaids.
			Remarkable restraint. Gomez, the
			sports book was under control, you
			only took my in-laws for what,
			four, five hundred dollars? Captain
			Wykoff, you're still sober -

HEAD TABLE

Where Anne's family reacts uncomfortably to all these
high jinks.

RESUME SCENE

				KATO
			-and Sarah -
				(pause)
			Most people only get one partner
			in life. I'm lucky to have two.

Kato pulls Anne close. Suddenly with a ROAR, a HELICOPTER
rises into view from behind the hill. Everyone turns.
The BACKWASH from the chopper disturbs their formal
clothing.

KATO

Puzzled, he PEERS into the craft -

IN THE CHOPPER - HIS P.O.V.

Beside the PILOT is Byron. And, behind him, using the
seatback for a sniper's rest, is Terrell. He is already
AIMING an ASSAULT RIFLE.

BACK TO SCENE

Instinct takes over. Kato turns, shouts

				KATO
			GET DOWN --

SEQUENCE - SLO-MO

And no, we're not doing the cliche ballet of death here,
because we're not in slo-mo for the bullets that we know
are going to come, but to observe the PEOPLE in the
instant before the shots ring out.

KATO has, from instinct, addressed his warning to his
partner,

SARAH, who turns herself to signal the other officers,
and then her eyes lock for a second on Kato's before
she is drawing her pistol and knocking the nearest
GUESTS to the ground -

KATO turns, looks at

ANNE, who is standing like most looking at the noisy
intruder hanging in mid-air while

WYKOFF

is diving, diving down to hug the earth behind the BAR
set up on the knoll -

ALL THE COPS

take down all the civilians they can gather in their
arms and then the ROAR and WIND of the helicopter's
BLADES merge with the SOUND of KATO's heart as he RUNS
toward the lens and seems to, by his own will, break
out of slo-mo and into

REAL TIME - RESUME

The bullets from the aircraft rip into the ritual below.
Bones and glass shatter equally. White tableclothes
drench in the red of blood and wine. Gomez, a step ahead
of the bullets, throws himself on a child. Rossi charges
the lens, FIRING. He's cut down like wheat.

IN THE HELICOPTER

Terrell pans the gun barrel, professional, clinical,
focused on the skill of weapon work. Byron looks out
the window, a lopsided grin on his face, enjoying the
result.

KATO

continues running forward, pausing as he sees a bawling
CHILD crawl out from under Gomez' body... then racing
bullets, literally, as they dog his heels, come perilously
along side and then pass him!

				KATO
			Aaanne---!

The bullets reach Anne a second after the CAMERA does.
Kato is there in time to catch her before she hits the
ground.

DOWN ANGLE

She's as loose as a baby. BLOOD wells with her pulse on
the breast of her wedding gown.

				ANNE
				(with odd grace)
			Kato... I knew you'd come...

She jerks spasmodically.

				ANNE
				(continuing; quickly)
			Our... father... who...

She's dead.

Kato's so stunned she slips from his hands to the ground,
her gold chain running through his hands until the cross
is gone to join her.

				KATO
			Nooooooooo!

He screams to the heavens and as he does he sees his own
devil.

THE HELICOPTER

is still there.

KATO

whirls, runs toward the helicopter. He's so crazed he
seems to think he can climb the sky. And son of a bitch
if he doesn't! He runs through the ruined party, leaps
onto a table, then to another, then vaults to the bar,
runs across the top, LEAPS to the top of the outdoor
heater, and before that teeters under his weight he has
grabbed the shaft of a flagpole, and swung into a tree!

IN THE HELICOPTER

They're all stunned.

				TERRELL
			Jesus Christ--!

THEIR POV

As Kato swings from tree to tree, CRASHING into the
copter's door! He yanks the hot gun barrel, pulls
Terrell forward so hard his head CRACKS the glass!

WIDER

The sudden addition of weight makes the craft tilt.
Kato drops down to the skids, catches hold just in
time. Immediately starts back up.

IN THE HELICOPTER

Terrell is still dazed. Terrified, Byron sees Kato
creeping toward him. He looks around, sees Terrell's
pistol in his waistband.

Kato gets one foot on the skid.

Byron draws the pistol, points it. Nothing happens.
And suddenly the two men are in a competition of death
as Byron tries to figure out hammer, slide and safety
while Kato climbs ever higher to kill him.

Kato reaches for him. Byron squeals in terror... closes
his eyes and with all his fear SQUEEZES the trigger with
both hands.

It goes off. BLOOD splatters what's left of the cockpit
window.

WIDE

Kato's body tumbles downward from the hovering aircraft.
He crashes through fifteen feet of evergreens and crumbles
at the trunk. The helicopter leaps into the sky, fleeing.
Sarah is the first one to reach the body, Wykoff a few
steps behind her. In the background, Anne's mother SINGS
to her child's body. Sarah takes Kato's bleeding head into
her lap and SCREAMS.

							   SMASH CUT TO:

A HELICOPTER'S BLADES - NIGHT

We HOLD for a moment, then WIDEN. This isn't the unmarked
craft from before. It's a white MEDIVAC chopper and it
DESCENDS toward the lens.

MEDIVAC HELICOPTER - IN FLIGHT - NIGHT

As it descends to the roof of a HOSPITAL. Immediately,
the crew brings out the patient: Kato, on portable life
support. He's rushed to the roof elevator.

THE SCENE - DIFFERENT ANGLE

PULL BACK and we SEE that we're looking at the helipad
from a WINDOW elsewhere in the hospital. Three PATIENTS
are watching: JULIUS, a soft featured wistful type who
could be any age from 20 to 40; OSWALD, mid-40's,
fidgety; and FETTERMAN, in his 60's, with a no-nonsense
military bearing.

				FETTERMAN
			Sloppy landing, sloppy landing.
			I landed MacArthur much better
			at Inchon. I hope he's doing okay.
			If the Red Chinese come into the
			war, we're screwed.

								CUT TO:

INT. OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT

TILT UP from Kato, almost unrecognizable due to bandages
and tubing. His head has just been shaved and is painted
with Betadyne. The surgeon in charge is DR. BATISH. She's
50, with the energy and lithe movements of a woman half
her age.

				DR. BATISH
			Patient is a 29 year old Asian
			male, a police officer in
			exceptional physical condition.
			We have a close range firearm
			entry wound above the right
			occipital put with an entry
			track through the frontal lobe
			ending on the border of the
			parietal...

				INTERN
			Let's hope it's on the border.
			If it's in the lobe we don't
			dare take the bullet out.

				DR. BATISH
				(dryly)
			Thank you, Roger. I appreciate
			the first year anatomy lesson.

Batish takes the cranial saw from a nurse.

				DR. BATISH
				(continuing)
			Okay, let's do it...

She hits the trigger twice, making a chain-saw like ROAR
that echoes around the room.

NEW ANGLE

Batish saws through the top of Kato's skull. BLOOD mists
the air.

MEDICAL TRAY

The top of the skull is placed in a dish.

UP ANGLE - THE DOCTORS

They gather around the open cranium. Look inside. Batish
probes carefully.

				BATISH
			Damn.

				INTERN
			What do we do?

				BATISH
			We close, that's what we do.
			That's all we can do.

Batish moves away, depressed. She doesn't like losing...
patients -or challenges. They look at her drawn face,
obey. She goes out of the operating room.

INT. HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR

Wykoff and Sarah rush her. Their wrinkled clothing and
Wykoff's heavy beard show us they've been there for hours.

				WYKOFF
			How is he?

				BATISH
			I don't have enough energy left to
			be diplomatic: In twenty years
			I've never seen anyone with brain
			damage this extensive who lived
			for ten minutes, let alone ten
			hours.

				SARAH
			What... what are you saying?
			Is... is he going to die?

				BATISH
			If he's lucky.
				(walking away,
				 depressed)
			But I'm afraid he's going to live.

							   DISSOLVE TO:

INT. HOSPITAL - SUN ROOM - DAY

We PAN the area. A RADIO is playing - a NEWS PROGRAM
that lets us know it's now, today. And sitting in a
wheelchair in the path of one lonely sunbeam is Kato.

His appearance is startling. The bullet and the operation
have scarred him bizarrely, but there's a perverse,
savage beauty to the damage... his face might almost be
considered arresting or mysterious, like the Phantom of
the Opera's...

if only the expression weren't so... so blank.

Kato doesn't move, doesn't blink. Some drool gathers in
the corner of his mouth. Drips down onto his hospital
pajamas. Nobody notices. Nobody cares.

WALDO, an orderly, comes over, pushes the wheelchair.

				WALDO
			Come on, Kato. Time for Group.
			Yeah, I can tell you're excited.
			How'd you like that Raiders game?
			No shit, I lost a bundle, too.

								CUT TO:

INT. HOSPITAL - GROUP ROOM - DAY

Batish comes in, hospital INTERNS trailing her. Her
hairstyle and glasses have changed, but not her energy
level or efficientcy. She sits down in a circle of chairs.

				BATISH
			Hello. Welcome to the Processing
			Group. For those of you here for
			the first time, I'd like to review
			what we do here.
				(more)
			This group provides social and
			psychological therapy for people
			who due to trauma or disease have
			lost their ability to process
			certain mental information. This
			rarely affects intelligence, but
			manifests itself in other ways.
			Sometimes with delusions or
			paranoia... sometimes in an
			inability to grasp the passage
			of time. And sometimes in an
			inability to retain information
			and memory.
				(to the group)
			Would someone like to start?

				JULIUS
			I would, Dr. Batish. I just want
			to say how happy I am to be
			joining the group. I've heard a
			lot about it, and I just know it's
			going to help me with my memory
			problems.

Long pause. Everyone looks at him, not very impressed
by his sincerity.

				BATISH
				(gently)
			Uh, Julius...? You've been in the
			group for three years.

				JULIUS
			I have?

				BATISH
			Yes. Look in your pocket.

CLOSER

He reaches into his breast pocket, is startled to find
something there: A photograph.

				JULIUS
			Where did this come from?

				BATISH
			We took it... last Christmas? To
			help you remember all our names...?

He looks at it. It shows a Christmas party in this same
room. Julius is posing under the tree with some of the
other patients.

The NAMES of everyone have been posted under their
faces - a memory aid that obviously ain't working.

				JULIUS
			I don't remember it. Are you sure?

				OSWALD
			Don't trust her. It's a fake,
			just like the moon landing.

				ANOTHER PATIENT
				(jumping up, to
				 Oswald)
			The moon landing was not fake!
			I know because I was there!

				JULIUS
				(startled)
			Wait a minute, somebody landed on
			the moon...?

				BATISH
			Please, let's not get sidetracked-

				FETTERMAN
			How can you all sit here shooting
			the shit when the whole country is
			facing a crisis? President Eisenhower
			is in critical condition!

				BATISH
			Uh, Fetterman; Eisenhower is dead.

				FETTERMAN
			Oh, Jesus Christ, then Nixon's
			President!

Batish tries to force a smile and carry on. But she
glances up and SEES

SARAH - THROUGH GLASS PARTITION

coming down the corridor. She waves at Batish familiarly.

BACK TO SCENE

				BATISH
			Excuse me. I'll be back in a
			minute.

				JULIUS
			Such a polite woman.
				(pause)
			Who is she?

				OSWALD
			Shhhh, nobody talk. The room's
			bugged.

IN THE CORRIDOR

				BATISH
			Hello, Sarah. How's the new
			partner?

				SARAH
			Still going through puberty.
			Anything to report?

She looks through the glass at the group. By now Oswald
is looking for hidden microphones under the seats.

But Sarah is only looking at Kato.

				BATISH
			No. Not today.

				SARAH
			And tomorrow?

				BATISH
			Have I ever lied to you?

				SARAH
			Not in two years. And I still
			keep coming back. Next week.

Batish squeezes her hand.

				BATISH
			Next week.

								CUT TO:

JULIUS - CLOSE

He has just "discovered" the photograph in his pocket
again. As he puzzles over it we WIDEN to SEE the group
breaking up.

				BATISH
				(in mid-speech)
			-- thank you all for joining us.
			It's been stimulating, as always.
			Until next time.

She gets up, leaves. She pauses beside Kato, touches his
wrist. Then she walks over to Waldo, speaks quietly. He
nods.

ANGLE ON WALDO

He comes over, starts to wheel Kato down the hall. We HOLD
on them as they leave, and then CAMERA discovers CLARENCE
SHERMAN, PhD. His eyes narrow, boring in on Kato. Clarence
looks around, spots Batish. We STAY with him as he catches
up to her.

				CLARENCE
				(waving a file)
			Dr. Batish, I'd like to talk to
			you about that patient of yours...
			John Kato. Why is he in your
			Processing Group? That's for high
			functioning mental patients of
			"normal" intelligence. Kato is a
			complete catatonic!

Batish breaks her quick stride, turns to face Clarence.

				BATISH
			Look, Clarence, we both know your
			doctorate is in Hotel Management,
			so don't start diagnosing my patients.
			And for your information, Kato is
			not catatonic.

She walks away. Indignant, he catches up again.

				CLARENCE
			Not catatonic?

He opens the file, reads as they walk.

				CLARENCE
				(continuing)
			"... Severe damage to the parietal
			lobe, complete destruction of the
			perceptive fibers. As a result,
			patient cannot feel pain, heat,
			cold or any physical sensations..."
			If that's not catatonic, I'm a
			moron.

				BATISH
			You're a moron. Yes, that is an
			accurate description of the
			physical damage to his brain. But
			everything else - memory, speech,
			locomotion - those things are all
			intact. That's why he's in the
			group. So he can start making human
			connections again.

She's reached her goal, the vending machines. She opens
her purse.

				CLARENCE
			Well, doctor, if he's capable of
			walking, talking and thinking,
			then why is he doing an imitation
			of a Caesar Salad at the taxpayer's
			expense?

Batish stops, trapped. She turns, sighs.

				BATISH
				(finally)
			I... don't know. I've tried every-
			thing. The only possibility is
			that at the time of physical injury
			there was tremendous psychological
			trauma as well. Kato's wife was
			murdered, right in his arms. It may
			be that the undamaged portion of
			his mind just shut down to protect
			itself from that memory.

She takes out change, goes to the candy machine.

				CLARENCE
			Then how do you cure that?

				BATISH
			You keep him in physical therapy
			so his muscles don't atrophy, and
			you wait and hope that the world
			will somehow push the button...
			Damn!

She's said this because the machine has eaten her quarter.

				CLARENCE
			The button?

She wiggles the knob, then the little change door.

				BATISH
			Yeah. The button. It might be a
			piece of music, the smell of a
			familiar kitchen... the voice of
			a friend... or the face of an enemy.
			Anything that punches hard enough
			on the pain that locked up his
			brain. Struck the second time,
			sometimes the motor of the mind
			starts up again.

				CLARENCE
				(scornful)
			That's your theory?

				BATISH
			Yes.

She KICKS the vending machine. Gets her candy bar.

				BATISH
				(continuing; exiting)
			Sometimes it works.

								CUT TO:

EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY

Sarah comes out. A CAR cruises slowly alongside her.
A big good looking young galoot named TONY is driving.
He's not as good looking as he thinks he is.

				TONY
			Hey, doll. Want to take a
			moustache ride?

				SARAH
				(weary)
			Don't you have to start shaving
			first?

We TIGHTEN as she gets in. The accouterments in the car
-and the CRACKLE of a police radio - make us realize it's
an unmarked police car.

				SARAH
				(continuing)
			We on a call?

				TONY
			Nah, our luck. Back to the
			division for paperwork. How's
			your friend?

				SARAH
			Better.

				TONY
			Bullshit. Guys at the station,
			they talk. Elvis'll wake up
			before he does.

				SARAH
			I don't want your opinion any more
			than your come-ons, okay?
				(unconvincingly)
			There's always hope. Like Scarlet
			said... "Tomorrow's another day."
				(pause; depressed)
			Fiddle-de-fucking-dee.

They drive away. CAMERA PANS across the street. Two
MEN -CUSTIS and STOKES - are in a parked car. Custis
PHOTOGRAPHS the cops with a digital camera.

								CUT TO:

INT. BIODYNE PHARMACEUTICALS - DAY

WIDEN from a flush-mounted desk MONITOR. The DIGITAL
PHOTOS we saw taken earlier are being DOWNLOADED. Custis
and Stokes are seated here, giving their report to a MAN
who sits, back to the CAMERA, looking at the city below.

				CUSTIS
			She came today, same as every week.

CAMERA CIRCLES the room as Custis speaks. Some other
MEN stand around the desk.

We realize with a start that we recognize some of these
people: Pring. Acer. And - Terrell. But all have changed.
Not like the slight changes of hairstyles and wardrobe on
Sarah and Batish; here, the changes are deliberate.
Exaggerated.

It's as if these people wanted to change as much as
possible... but only on the outside.

				TERRELL
			And the doctors? Does she talk to
			them? About medicine? Research?
				(with meaning)
			Pharmaceuticals?

				CUSTIS
			No. And we checked.

				STOKES
			Yeah. I went in last week, did my
			vending machine repairman, schmoozed
			with the nurses. Pay attention to
			the ugly ones, they talk up a storm.
			This gash is definitely not working
			on a case. All she does is visit
			this patient...

As Stokes fumbles through some notes, Custis comes to
his rescue, tweaking the equipment.

				CUSTIS
			John Kato. Used to be her partner.
			Former SFPD Police Detective,
			retired two years ago, full metal
			disability pension. No immediate
			family. Only visitor is the
			surveillance suspect.

The last figure the CAMERA finds is leaning back in a
luxurious chair in the shadows. But now it leans forward
into the light. It's Byron. Clean shaven now, hair
marcelled back, body Armani-ized. Only the driven eyes
are the same.

He looks up at Terrell.

				BYRON
			So she's not interested in me.
			I thought I made more of an
			impression.

				TERRELL
			How could you? "Conrad Byron"
			didn't exist until two years ago.

He taps Sarah's image on the video screen.

				TERRELL
				(continuing)
			And she can stop existing whenever
			you say.

Pring and Acer look up expectantly, sensing action. But
Byron rocks in his chair, pensive.

				BYRON
			No. She's been chasing smoke for
			two years, looking for a man who
			doesn't exist anymore. Killing her
			would bring an investigation. We
			don't need to attract attention,
			not with a high profile drug ready
			to hit the market.

				STOKES
			That everything?

				BYRON
			Not quite. We're going over our
			pharmacy inventory and there seem
			to be some discrepancies: Ether.
			Dimethylamine. Oxalychloide...

				STOKES
				(casual)
			...why would I know anything about
			that?

				TERRELL
			Because they're key ingredients
			for making crack cocaine in a
			street laboratory. Like the one
			you set up on...
				(checking a note)
			...South Vincent.

He looks cooly at Stokes, who has the sense to fold his hand.

				STOKES
			Okay. Okay. You got me, Mr. Byron.
			I thought maybe I could do a little
			thing of my own, but-- you're right,
			don't even say it, how could it be
			my own taste when I didn't even pop
			for the materials. One thing you
			gotta know is I never touched the
			stuff myself, I don't smoke, drink
			nothing. You can have everything
			back. The chemicals that are left...
			the money I made...

				BYRON
			We have enough of both, thank you.
			And now... thanks to you, we have
			exposure. I don't like exposure,
			Stokes. We're on the verge of a
			big government contract. We can't
			risk our reputation for pennies.

				STOKES
			Your reputation? You're pushing
			drugs for the government... I'm
			pushing them on the street, what's
			the fucking difference?

				BYRON
			That's a profound philosophical
			question, Stokes. Perhaps you'll
			help us answer it in the years to
			come.

				STOKES
				(seizing the life
				 jacket)
			Y-you mean you're gonna let me
			go..?

				BYRON
			I mean we're always short on donor
			organs for our tissue banks.
			Especially young healthy donors
			who never smoke or drink.

Stokes jumps up, too late. Already Terrell has drawn
and aimed a silencer equipped .40 caliber. THUP THUP.

Stokes, shot in mid-wanna-escape leap, arcs almost
gracefully to the floor, then slides across the polished
marble.

				INTERCOM VOICE
			Mr. Byron, Dr. Fields called. She
			wants to see you in the lab right
			away.

				BYRON
			Tell her I'm on my way, Janice.
			Oh, and Janice... have Quinn and
			Baker come in here. I want my
			office swept again for bugs.

He stands, closes the computer file on Sarah. It WINKS OUT.

				BYRON
				(continuing)
			Have Mr. Stokes... dismantled, Mr.
			Terrell. Try not to damage too much
			of the merchandise. We get good
			prices for all the parts.

RECEPTION AREA

JANICE nods to two big men, QUINN and BAKER. They nod
knowingly, go into the office as Byron comes out.

				BYRON
				(aside)
			Make sure you sweep under the rug.

CAMERA follows Byron as he crosses the Penthouse floor.
He passes ranks of the impressive hi-tech medical
machines his company supplies. As he is about to hit the
elevator button, the elevator opens and DR. ANNABELLE
FIELDS storms out, a large piece of CARDBOARD under her
arm. Around 40, looking a decade younger because she gets
up at six to pound a punching bag so she can deal with all
the assholes in her life. Right now, her chief asshole is
Byron.

				BYRON
				(continuing)
			Dr. Fields, I was just on my way
			down to see y--

				FIELDS
			What the hell is going on?

She flips over the cardboard. A mock up of an advertisement,
it shows happy, vacant-eyed workers on some public
infrastructure project. The multi-racial cast and the color
coordinated hard hats have the slick appeal of a soft drink
ad. Only the name -CIVICALM - and the illustration of a
PRESCRIPTION BOTTLE in a corner inset tells us this is an
ad for a drug and not gum or cigarettes.

				FIELDS
				(continuing)
			How can you plan a campaign for a
			drug I haven't even finished beta
			testing - ?

				BYRON
			Doctor, there's nothing wrong with
			contingency planning. If we wait
			until all our ducks are in a row
			before we plan, we -

She puts her hand firmly on his back, steers him into
the elevator.

				FIELDS
			- could end up with some very dead
			ducks. Hit "twelve."

Byron hesitates, not used to being addressed in this
manner. But he complies. The doors SHUT.

								CUT TO:

AN ELEVATOR - LAB FLOOR - DAY

The elevator opens. Fields and Byron exit, walk through
a room full of LABORATORY ANIMALS in cages. There's
everything from rats to rabbits to dogs and chimps. They
approach a pneumatic door. Fields hits the control and it
whooshes open.

OTHER SIDE

They walk into NOISE and STATIC.

REVERSE ANGLE

Fields' ASSISTANTS are using a powerful MMR CATSCAN.

				FIELDS
			Jesus, Raoul, don't use that with-
			out the warning light - !

Already Fields' PENS are rattling in her pockets.
Byron's TIE TACK jerks away from his chest and -

CLOSE

CLANGS onto the side of the MMR.

WIDER

As the assistants shut down the machine. The tie tack
falls to the floor. The mortified assistant scramble to
get it.

				ASSISTANT
			I - I'm sorry Mr. Byron -

				BYRON
				(even)
			No harm done.

				FIELDS
				(to the assistants)
			Get lost. Now!

They quickly exit through the pneumatic door. Fields moves
further along to a computer workspace.

				FIELDS
				(continuing)
			Sorry about that, Ace. Take a
			chair.

				BYRON
			I don't like the tone of your voice.
			I'm the head of this company.

				FIELDS
			Okay, take two chairs.

She hits buttons on her keyboard. A VIDEO WINDOW appears
on the computer screen. Footage of a WHITE RAT in a CAGE.

				FIELDS
				(continuing)
			You see this? Civicalm. Normal dose
			for a healthy adult rat.

She hits the button. Another cage, another rat. Then
another.

				FIELDS
				(continuing)
			Normal dose for an adult...
			Normal dose for an adult...

				BYRON
			Seems fine.

				FIELDS
			Try this.

She hits another key. Now we see one mouse after another.
Staggering. Twitching... dying.

				FIELDS
				(continuing)
			Normal dose for an adult. Normal
			dose for an adult. Ditto, yadda
			and yadda.

				BYRON
			Obviously the dosage was wrong.

				FIELDS
			No, it wasn't.

She stands.

				FIELDS
				(continuing)
			There's just a variation in the
			weight of adult rats of 20 to 30
			grams. Not very much... but just
			enough to make the "normal" dose
			for one rat a fatal dose for
			another.

				BYRON
			I don't see your concern. There's
			no problem with Civicalm. Just
			with the subjects.

				FIELDS
			No problem? If you extrapolate a
			20 gram variation to humans, you're
			talking about four pounds. People
			gain and lose four pounds in a week!
			And people weigh from 90 pounds to
			250 pounds, there's no way we can
			standardize the dosage!

				BYRON
			Relax, Doctor. It's under control.
			Toleration variation is routine in
			this industry -

				FIELDS
			Yes, but people ain't gonna
			tolerate this variation, they're
			gonna drop fucking dead. That's
			taking sedation a little too far.

Byron stands, uses his Board of Directors meeting voice.

				BYRON
			Doctor Fields. The United States
			Government has contracted us to
			develop a reliable low cost
			sedative without the psychological
			side effects of previous hypnotics.
			My research says we have done this.

				FIELDS
			Your research might as well be
			printed on toilet paper, 'cause
			that's all it's good for.

She hits the computer. A graph comes up, then a DNA
"footprint", other information.

				FIELDS
				(continuing)
			Look at these variations. All
			over the map. And this serum you
			incubated Civicalm in... where
			the hell did it come from?
				(peering closer to
				 screen)
			Where is this "original animal
			subject thriving after five years"?

				BYRON
			The subject is... thriving.

				FIELDS
			The subject ain't human, that's for
			sure, not with this serum footprint.
			This isn't simian, either... looks
			canine except for these mutated
			genes...

				BYRON
				(sharply)
			I'm not here to play 20 questions,
			not on my salary. Nor on yours.

				FIELDS
			You expect me to meet the FDA
			people on Thursday?

				BYRON
			That's what I'm paying you for.
			And between now and then I expect
			you to run all of these tests again.
			And again.

				FIELDS
			All right. But it won't change one
			fucking thing about this fucking
			drug.

				BYRON
			You're predicting the results of
			the tests before you run them the
			second time. Hardly scientific
			method.

He moves to the door, turns.

				BYRON
				(continuing)
			I expect more professionalism on
			Thursday.

				FIELDS
			I'll try not to say "fucking" in
			front of the FDA.

He looks at her sharply, goes out.

INT. ANIMAL LAB - DAY

Terrell and Acer are waiting near some of the cages.
Byron joins them.

				TERRELL
			She's going to crack, isn't she?
				(on Byron's look)
			Let me take care of her.

				BYRON
			Not yet. Billions are at stake with
			this government deal. I need Fields
			to sign off on the research or we'll
			lose the contract. After that... if
			she's a loose cannon... she's a loose
			cannon that goes overboard.

He gets in the elevator, leaves. Terrell finishes up his
cigarette, notices the CHIMP in the nearby cage. With a
grin, he flicks the butt into the cage. The chimp eagerly
picks it up... then HOWLS in pain when he burns his fingers.

				TERRELL
			Stupid fuck. You never learn.

A BEAUTIFUL SUNSET

CAMERA ADJUSTS. We're in the sunroom. Kato sits by the
window, head lolling, eyes vacant. Collar wet from his
own drool.

A JANITOR mops the area. Moves a table lamp, a potted
plant, and then Kato.

None of them seem to mind.

NEW ANGLE

As the janitor moves away, Batish appears, drained after a
long day. She notices Kato, turns toward Waldo, who's moving
a BODY down the corridor.

				BATISH
			Waldo, can you get Kato back to
			the ward?

				WALDO
				(indicating his
				 gurney)
			Right away, Doc, gotta hit the
			freezer first.

He goes into the elevator. CAMERA HOLDS on this corridor.
The janitor has mopped his way down to a fire door. It
OPENS behind him. We HEAR his muffled voice:

				JANITOR
			You ain't supposed to use this
			door. Go around to -

That's all he says before he is battered and kicked into
silence by three JUNKIES. They move as quietly as they
can down the corridor. The LEADER sneaks a glance around
the corner.

HIS POV

CAMERA PANS the empty corridors... then moves to - the
PHARMACY, closed at this hour.

BACK TO SCENE

				LEADER
			Fucking candy store, man. Take
			what we need, sell the leftovers.

				2ND JUNKIE
			What leftovers?

Laughter, ending in a hacking cough. They're all sliding
into withdrawal. They cross quickly toward the pharmacy.
As they move, one of them draws up short.

				3RD JUNKIE
			Fuck, we're busted!

CAMERA adjusts. He's pointing to Kato. They freeze...
until the leader looks at Kato more carefully. He grins.

				LEADER
			Busted?

He steps closer - flicks his CIGARETTE into Kato's face.
No reaction... even as the butt falls to Kato's breast
and burns out, scorching his pajamas.

				LEADER
				(continuing)
			He's a fucking carrot, dipshit.
			Now open sesame.

The 3rd junkie takes out lockpicks. With shaky hands he
starts to work on the door.

				LEADER
				(continuing)
			Come on, come on, you said you're
			a pro -

				3RD JUNKIE
			I - I got the shakes, Eddie -

				BATISH'S VOICE
			What are you doing?

NEW ANGLE

Batish has returned. Even as she asks the question she
realizes the answer. She spins, darts toward a phone.
It's halfway to her ear before the Junkie Leader has
charged forward, yanked its wire out and pressed her
against the wall.

				JUNKIE LEADER
			You got a key, mama?

				BATISH
			Get out of here. Now. Before it's
			too late.

				JUNKIE LEADER
			It's already too late, bitch.

He grabs her roughly, drags her to the pharmacy door.

				JUNKIE LEADER
				(continuing)
			Open it.

				BATISH
			I don't have the key.

He slaps her.

				BATISH
				(continuing)
			I said I -

He slaps her again.

				BATISH
				(continuing)
			- don't have the key.

He looks at her, as pissed that she isn't afraid as he is
that she isn't cooperating. Suddenly he grabs the shoulders
of her lab coat and pulls them down, pinioning her arms.
He quickly pats her down.

				LEADER
			No key, huh? No key?
				(realizing it's true)
			No fucking key - !

				2ND JUNKIE
			Jesus, Eddie, we gotta get
			something-

				LEADER
			Yeah, we're gonna get something...
			right now.

He looks at Batish with a different expression. Runs his
hands over her body again.

				LEADER
				(continuing)
			You're pretty fine for an old lady,
			you know that?

And in an instant he knocks her to the floor. He kneels
over her but even though her arms are pinned her legs
aren't. She kicks him hard.

				LEADER
				(continuing)
			Bitch! Hold her!

KATO

Still sitting, still drooling, while the SOUND of the
violation continues, ten feet away.

BACK TO SCENE

The men take turns kissing her sloppily, giggling. Then
it gets serious. The leader starts to rip open Batish's
clothes. She fights him furiously, punching, biting,
kicking. It's all the others can do to hold her down.

KATO

No change... unless a longer trickle of saliva counts...

BACK TO SCENE

The Leader takes out a knife. Slits Batish's bra open.

HOSPITAL WINDOWSILL - SAME TIME

The crow lands here. It peers intently into the room.
CAMERA TIGHTENS on it.

KATO

Is it our imagination, or was there a flicker of a
reaction in his eyes?

CROW - AT THE WINDOW

It CAWS, flutters away.

BACK TO SCENE - LOW ANGLE

The Leader UNZIPS HIS FLY, spreads Batish's legs. Suddenly
the 2ND JUNKIE looks up - as TWO WHITE CLAD LEGS appear in
the foreground. The 3rd Junkie notices them first. We
follow him upwards as he stands.

				3RD JUNKIE
			Hey. It's the carrot.

NEW ANGLE

They all turn. Kato is standing there on unsteady feet,
face still a blank cipher. Behind him, the wheelchair
finishes a graceful TURN from the momentum of Kato's
rising.

				LEADER
			Get rid of him.

The 3rd Junkie snaps out a switchblade. Swings it. Suddenly
Kato's arm is up to block the blow. The 3rd Junkie blinks.

HIS POV

The knife is in Kato's arm.  TILT UP. Expressionless,
showing no pain, Kato looks at the knife. How did that
get there? We almost hear long dormant mental gears
turning. Knife. Perpetrator. Victim.

BACK TO SCENE

The 3rd Junkie starts to giggle.

				3RD JUNKIE
			And we thought we was stoned.

WHAM. A FIST ends his sentence.

ON THE FLOOR

The other two junkies REACT as their friend SLAMS down
beside them, nose shattered, eyes blank.

TEETH and BLOOD leak from his torn mouth.

BACK TO SCENE

The two remaining junkies leap to their feet. The 2nd junkie
charges - we HEAR the CRACK as Kato breaks his ARM, then
his KNEE. Kato spins, KICKS -

THE SECOND JUNKIE

SLAMS into a water cooler, which erupts around him, the
water turning RED -

THE REMAINING JUNKIE

PUNCHES Kato in the face brutally, twice.

There is absolutely no reaction. It's like hitting a wall.
The Junkie has the presence of mind to block Kato's return
punch -and then he HOWLS as Kato REACHES DOWN -

NEW ANGLE

As Kato grabs the guy by his... by his... well, by something
we remember is exposed and convenient. And - and even
though we can't see it clearly, the hysterical SCREAM from
the junkie gets the idea across as Kato whirls, SPINNING
HIM AROUND UNTIL HIS FEET ARE OFF THE GROUND. Then Kato
LETS HIM GO.

THE LAST JUNKIE

gets his wish: He gets into the Pharmacy. There's a
sickening CRASH as he goes halfway through the wired
glass and dangles there, four feet above the ground.

NEW ANGLE

He MOANS and passes out, bleeding from a dozen cuts.

BACK TO SCENE

The sounds of combat and now RINGING ALARMS bring security
guards and Waldo running.

				SECURITY GUARD
				(RE: the scene)
			Holy shit -

				WALDO
			Dr. Batish!

He helps her to her feet. She pulls her labcoat closed.
Already she has the presence of mind to take Waldo's ID
card from his lapel and use its clip to secure her own
modesty.

				WALDO
				(continuing)
			Are you okay?

				BATISH
			I'm fine, I'm fine - in fact...

She moves over to Kato, who now slumps to his knees, drained.
She peers into his face, takes out her little flashlight to
look in his eyes. As she hoped, he reacts.

				BATISH
				(continuing; smiling)
			- I couldn't be better.

				SECURITY GUARD
			Hey!

All turn. FOCUS CHANGE. He's by the Pharmacy.

				SECURITY GUARD
				(continuing)
			Where's this guy's dick?

As Batish looks down at Kato's hand, suspicious, we

EXT. BIODYNE BUILDING - TO ESTABLISH - DAY

INT. FIELDS' LAB - DAY

Fields paces in her lab, trying to eat a yogurt, fuming
and muttering.

				FIELDS
			Goddamn Byron... who does he think
			he is, Lord Byron? "Don't worry,
			it's under control.." Under control,
			my ass. Under indictment is more
			like it. What does he think FDA is,

			getting paranoid.

Struck by a thought, Fields moves to her computer. Types
commands.

				COMPUTER VOICE
			Security files require a Grade

				FIELDS
			Try Grade Seven, bitch.

				COMPUTER VOICE
			Welcome, Doctor Fields. What do

Fields looks at the screen.

FIELDS' POV

The PHOTOGRAPHS and DATA on Sarah appear on this screen.

BACK TO SCENE
				FIELDS
			You're making Mr. Byron nervous,

Fields swivels in her chair, hits the "print" command.

SARAH'S PICTURE

chugs out of the laser printer and we

INT. HOSPITAL - NEURO WARD - DAY

Another group therapy session, similar to the earlier one.
Again, Kato sits quietly in his wheelchair on the edge of
the group.

				JULIUS
			How, how are you? I am really
			interested in group therapy. I
			think it might help me with my
			memory problem.

				FETTERMAN
			Jeez, this son of a bitch can't
			remember a thing, no wonder he's
			4F. Good thing he is not in Korea
			with MacArthur.

				BATISH
				(the patience of Job)
			Julius, you have been here before.
			Look in your pocket.

Julius takes out the photograph, reacts like he always does.

				JULIUS
			Hey, that's me... And these guys...
			I've seen them somewhere...

				BATISH
				(helpfully)
			They're right in front of you,
			just like in the picture.

				KATO
			Except... they changed their
			clothing.

You could hear a pin drop. Every head in the room turns
and looks at Kato.

				FETTERMAN
			Did... did you hear what he said?
			It's incredible -!

				KATO
			It... wasn't... that brilliant.

				OSWALD
			What is this shit? He's a goddamn
			vegetable for two years and all of
			a sudden he's little Mr. Chatterbox?

				BATISH
			Kato has had a breakthrough.

				OSWALD
			Breakthrough my ass. You mean new
			orders from the KGB, don't you,
			Doc?
				(more)
			Planting him in the group and
			getting him to play dumb didn't
			work, so now you try this? Well,
			it won't fool this loyal American!

				BATISH
			Uh... why don't we call it a day?

INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

Sarah's on the phone.

				SARAH
				(in mid-speech)
			--look, I hate mysteries. My

			I used them for BB gun practice.

EXT. PHONE BOOTH - INTERCUT - MAGIC HOUR

Fields is on the phone. She has a laptop computer in a
case over her shoulder.

				FIELDS
			Look, you must know Conrad Byron.

				SARAH
			I've seen his name in the
			newspapers. Does that count?

				FIELDS
			That doesn't explain why he's got
			you under surveillance.

				SARAH
			What?

				FIELDS
			I don't know why, but you make him
			nervous. That makes me trust you.
			Meet me in one hour outside the
			Cable roundhouse. It's on top of
			a hill and nobody can surprise us.

				SARAH
			Wait. I don't even know your -

BZZZ of a disconnect.

				SARAH
				(continuing)
			-name.
				(hanging up)
			Son of a bitch.

				TONY
				(coming over)
			Calling those 900 numbers again?

				SARAH
			What are you doing tonight?

				TONY
			Covering your ass?

He pats it for emphasis. She grabs his hand in an Aikido
move, pins him painfully to the table.

				SARAH
			Right. But don't take it literally.

NEW ANGLE

The SOUND of Tony hitting the desk makes other cops look
up, amused -none more than Wykoff. CAMERA tracks Sarah
and Tony as they leave - a move that also takes us behind
Sarah's DESK when her phone line rings. Wykoff answers.

				WYKOFF
			Ninth Division, Captain Wykoff
			speaking.

BATISH - IN HOSPITAL - SAME TIME - INTERCUT

				BATISH
			I'd like to speak to Sarah Weller,
			please.

				WYKOFF
			She just went out on a case. Can
			I give her a message?

				BATISH
			Just tell her that Laura called.
			With good news.

				WYKOFF
			Good news. Got it.

Batish hangs up. Moves over to Kato, stands in front of
his wheelchair.

				KATO
			Sarah. You said Sarah. I know that
			name.

				BATISH
			Yes. She's your friend. She visits
			you every week.

				KATO
			Visits me? Where did I go?
				(rephrasing)
			Where... am I?

				BATISH
			Don't you have any idea?

Kato looks around at his surroundings.

				KATO
			It's all... movies. Dreams. Like
			both, not like either. People
			trying to kill me...

A chilling thought races through his mind. Clumsily, he
starts to run his hand over the scar on his head.

				KATO
				(continuing)
			...people killing me.

Batish gingerly puts his hand down.

				BATISH
			All memories...

				KATO
				(mind working)
			Memories...
				(stronger)
			I have to talk to Sarah!

He tries to rise from the wheelchair. Batish tries to
calm him.

				BATISH
			I told you, I left a message for
			her -

				KATO
			This can't wait! It's about the men
			from the boat. They're the ones
			who... put me here. They... killed
			people... they flew away... they
			got away... they have to be stopped...

He overpowers her, gets out of the wheelchair. Takes
one step - and falls on his face. Batish rushes to his
side. So does Waldo. They help him onto unsteady feet.

				KATO
				(continuing)
			I... can't feel my legs. I can't
			feel... anything.
				(sotto, almost a
				 whisper)
			I can't feel anything... not
			anything...

				BATISH
			Don't worry about that. Just
			trust them to work for you. They
			worked yesterday.

He settles into the chair again, confused.

				KATO
			Yesterday..?

She points over to where workers are repairing the pharmacy
glass. He looks there, just can't connect.

Batish sees he's searching his scattered memories for
something just under the surface.

Suddenly she spins and throws a punch at him, pulling
short at the last moment.

Without even blinking he catches it. She winces in pain.
He releases her.

				BATISH
			See? Your reflexes remember even
			when you don't.

Kato extends his arms, looks at his hands like they're
strangers... and then looks at Batish like she isn't one.
He looks at Waldo, who smiles... looks back at Batish.

				KATO
				(hesitant)
			We've... met?

				BATISH
			We've met.

				KATO
			You helped me.

				BATISH
			You helped me.

				KATO
				(pause)
			Are you repeating everything I'm
			saying?

				BATISH
			Yes.

				KATO
			I thought so.
				(pause)
			Stop it.

				BATISH
				(smiling)
			Okay. Waldo, take Kato down to
			physical therapy... some pool
			work, I think. And when he's
			finished, put him in a room.
			Not the ward.

Waldo comes over, helps Kato back into the wheelchair.

				WALDO
			All right, Kato, a room. Moving up
			in the world.

				BATISH
				(checking her
				 clipboard)
			You can put him in with Julius.

				WALDO
			Doc, Julius likes being alone. He
			may not take to having a roommate.

				BATISH
			Don't worry, he'll never remember
			it long enough to complain.

INT. FIELDS' OFFICE - NIGHT

CAMERA CIRCLES THE ROOM as Terrell, Acer and Pring pull
out file drawers, search through floppy flies with growing
dismay.

				PRING

			Shredded. Every scrap of paper

				ACER

			What the fuck is this?

COMPUTER SCREEN

DATA "spills" off the top line on the screen, "swirls"
away with draining noises.

				COMPUTER VOICE
			Computer disk scrubbed. All

				PRING
			Cleanliness is next to Godliness...

				ACER
			Some kind of stupid joke...

CAMERA ADJUSTS as Terrell flings a handful of floppy
disks on the desk, all cut in half.

				TERRELL
			No joke. She's bolted. Trashed
			everything.

				BYRON
				(entering)
			Except what she took.
				(on their looks)
			Gotta be, gentlemen. She destroyed

			Occam's razor. She's going to talk.

Byron turns to Terrell, expectant.

				BYRON

			Make me happy, Terrell. You always

			I put a tracer on her car.

Byron smiles.

INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

Batish, coat on, heads for home. Clarence intercepts her
at the door.

				CLARENCE
			Dr. Batish, everyone's talking
			about your little miracle you
			pulled off with Mr. Kato.

				BATISH
			If it was a miracle, he did it,
			not me. But it's true. He's
			walking, talking -

				CLARENCE
				(reading from notes)
			-and destroying hospital facilities
			to the tune of twenty six hundred
			dollars. And we still haven't heard
			from the plumbers.

				BATISH
			We do have insurance -

				CLARENCE
			-which will not cover us if we
			continue to keep a dangerous
			psychopath in a facility that's
			not designed for that purpose.

				BATISH
			He's not dangerous -

				CLARENCE
			Really? What about those two dead
			men... not to mention the one in
			the Urology ward singing soprano?

				BATISH
			They were criminals. Kato was -
			is- a policeman. He did what his
			instincts told him to do.

				CLARENCE
			My instincts say we should ship
			him to State.

				BATISH
			Your instincts also told you to
			buy Beta instead of VHS for the
			children's center.

Batish goes past him, into the night.

				CLARENCE
				(at the door, annoyed)
			Damn it, Batish. If he can't feel
			pain, heat, emotion, how human can
			he be? God knows what's going on
			in that mind of his!

INT. CORRIDORS - KATO'S POV - NIGHT

UP ANGLE of the ceiling going past. Seen through Kato's
damaged perception, the ceiling is weirdly, wildly out
of proportion and dimension: It's like the "Caligari"
set, but with shadows that...

...squirm.

REVERSE DOWN ANGLE - KATO

Being pushed along by SOMEONE WE CANNOT SEE. Suddenly we
turn into a doorway. Whoever is pushing the wheelchair
moves away.

INT. "ISHMAEL" ROOM - KATO'S POV - NIGHT

Strange angles and lighting make the furniture seem twisted
and warped... yet somehow, still warm.

Someone SITS DOWN behind the giant desk. His face is hidden
but his voice - though strange and bizarre -resonates with
power.

				VOICE
			Sorry to drag you out on a
			night like this, Mr. Kato.

				KATO
			W-who are you?

				VOICE
			You may call me "Ishmael." Oh...
			don't worry about your vision.
			You were given a mild sedative
			when we brought you here.

				KATO
			Here? Where am I?

Kato looks around the room.

ROOM - KATO'S POV

Seen through his eyes, all the angles are off, all the
furnishings out of scale. Nonetheless, the warped perception
doesn't disguise the fact that the room is full of
Americana... flags, busts of Lincoln, an eagle inkwell.
It's twisted, yet comforting. CAMERA pans to the backlit
Ishmael.

				ISHMAEL
			That's not important, Mr. Kato.
			I've been looking at your file.
			You were an outstanding police
			officer.

				KATO
			And t-that's why you... dragged me
			here in... the middle of the night?

				ISHMAEL
			Exactly. Our organization - like
			the one you served with - is a
			special strike team. But not one
			with such a limited vision as anti
			smuggling. We take a broader view
			but with a sharper edge. We answer
			directly to the Oval Office. We
			have no bureaucracy. No congressional
			hearings. We have only our nerve
			and a handful of trusted Agents.
			And we'd like you to become one of
			them.

Even in his condition Kato can see the absurdity.

				KATO
			You... can't be serious.

				ISHMAEL
			We're deadly serious. One of our
			field agents forwarded your file
			to us.
				(indicating folder)
			You're the perfect Agent. Offically
			listed in all the public records as
			a helpless invalid.

				KATO
			I am helpless...

				ISHMAEL
			According to this police report
			on my desk, three would be rapists
			have a very different opinion.
			And your medical records indicate
			that your physical reflexes are
			completely intact.

				KATO
			My... mind isn't. My...

				ISHMAEL
				(agreeing)
			Yes, your language skills have
			been severely impaired. Not a
			problem. We're not hiring you
			for chit chat. We're hiring you
			to be an instrument of justice.

				KATO
			I'm still a long shot. That's not
			enough reason.

				ISHMAEL
			Mr. Kato, people in our line of
			work are willing to lay down their
			lives for something. I won't say
			it's America, because these days...
			well, son, these days America is
			in bad shape. Some people say she's
			finished. Damaged goods.
				(pause)
			They say the same about you. So
			why not a damaged American to save
			a damaged Nation? It has a certain
			sense of poetry.

Does Ishmael's hand reach out, strike a control? It's
hard to tell in the dim light... but... from somewhere...
PATRIOTIC MUSIC begins to quietly PLAY.

KATO - NORMAL PHOTOGRAPHY

Somehow it's making sense to him.

				KATO
			There... there's things I want to
			do... have to do...

FAVORING ISHMAEL'S SHADOWED FACE

				ISHMAEL
			Yes, exactly! You want to do what
			you were trained to do. You want
			to fight for justice and right,
			and destroy evil and greed.

				KATO
			My... my partner...

				ISHMAEL
			Yes, I will be your partner.
			Together we will remove the tumor
			of ennui from the body politic of
			America!

				KATO
			My partner is Sarah. I have to
			see her... tell her...

				ISHMAEL
			Yes, tell her you've joined our
			crusade. Right now she and those
			like her are alone out there
			struggling against overwhelming
			odds - waiting for their Champion
			America's salvation! You, Kato -
			you!

FAVORING KATO

He stands, full of energy for the first time.

				KATO
			Sarah.

				ISHMAEL
			Go to her, Kato! Protect her-
			protect us all!

The Patriotic MUSIC BUILDS. Kato whirls, runs out
of the room.

INT. CORRIDOR - LOW ANGLE

Kato steps into a shaft of light and... A HUGE SHADOW
falls across him.

REVERSE ANGLE

It's the crow, fluttering like an avatar at the window.

BACK TO SCENE

The giant shadowy wings seem to flap from Kato's own
back. He rises with them - LEAPS towards the glass!

EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

Kato CRASHES through the window, lands on the street,
runs off into the night.

THE CROW - ECU

atop a streetlight, it CAWS triumphantly.

EXT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

Finder is here, trying to get laid. Like our other
characters, he has changed a bit, but he's still desperately
hip.

				FINDER
				(to a pretty girl)
			Yessir. You got your uptown Yuppies.
			You got your downtown gangstas.
			They both think they're above the
			law, one 'cause he can buy it off
			and one 'cause he can kill it off.
			But even so there's places they
			can't go. That's where I come in.

				GIRL
			Well I know one place you can't go
			tonight, baby, even if you go and
			get a lawyer.

LAUGHTER from the group.

				FINDER
			Okay, girl, you want to pass on me
			because I was up front with you?
			Fine. There's better than you
			waitin' right around the next
			corner.

LONG SHOT - AROUND THE CORNER

Finder finishes his tirade, turns - and then REACTS as
Kato jumps in from an impossibly high perch, landing
at his feet.

				FINDER
			Hold that thought.

				KATO
			Finder. You're Finder.

				FINDER
			Hey, nobody's laid that old name
			on me in a while, Jack. It was
			lame, man. Like the fucking
			Cowsills, Jack. It's Shazam now,
			Shazam. You want something...
			Shazam! You got it.

				KATO
			Shazam.

				FINDER
			It's like the magic word.

				KATO
			Shazam.

				FINDER
			Right, that's it, you got it.

				KATO
			But it isn't working. I have said
			it, twice. I do not have what I
			want and you are still... talking.

				FINDER
			Oh, I see, you're one of those
			sidewalk lawyers. But if kinda
			helps if you tell me what you
			want first.

				KATO
			Sarah. I want Sarah. She is
			struggling against evil and greed.
				(continuing)
			Trying to get out of the darkness
			and into the light. She needs me.

				FINDER
			Uh... right.
				(sudden thought)
			Sarah?

He moves closer, turns Kato into the light.

				FINDER
				(continuing)
			Shit. It's you. Kato! Man, they
			said you was dead, and here you
			are, looking so -

He stops, seeing the scars, the hospital clothes.

				FINDER
				(continuing)
			-uh, fine. Sarah, she's your old
			partner, right?

				KATO
			Yes. She's struggling against evil
			and greed, struggling to get out
			of the darkness -

				FINDER
			Yeah, I got that part.
				(putting his arm
				 around Kato)
			Well, look, my man, I still got
			my contacts in the SFPD, my boys
			on the street.
				(pointing)
			I got my official police scanner in
			the car where I can hear her call
			into the precinct. We'll find where
			she's at. But this ain't like before
			when you had that badge to squeeze
			me a little. You ain't got that
			juice now. You gotta cough up like
			everybody else.
				(seeing the blank
				 look)
			I mean, you gotta have the moola.
			Bread. Dinero. Money!

				KATO
			You want "money"?

>From the way Kato's lips form the word we realize it is
lost in the misfiled sections of his mind. But wait...

				KATO
				(continuing; brow
				 furrowed)
			Money...

And then like a curtain lifting - well, a bit, anyway -
we see that the concept of money returns to his
consciousness, and with that the realization that he doesn't
have any.

				KATO
				(continuing;
				 dismayed)
			Money!

				FINDER
			Right. How much you got?

Kato looks pensive, lost. Then he looks O.S. and smiles.
With a karate SCREAM, he LEAPS. Finder jumps backwards,
but the attack isn't aimed at him:

NEW ANGLE

Kato flies through the air as far as humanly possible -
one leg extending with savage fury - and then CONNECTING
with

AN ATM

He hits it. The machine is DEMOLISHED. Money EXPLODES
everywhere.

BACK TO SCENE

Kato LANDS from his impossible leap with a rolling RECOVERY,
landing in front of Finder, who is still reacting to the
SNOWSTORM of money around him.

				KATO
			Is this enough?

EXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREET - NEAR ROUNDHOUSE - NIGHT

TIGHT ON A COMPUTER SCREEN - NIGHT

We WIDEN. It's Fields' laptop, perched on the hood of Sarah
and Tony's car. Fields' car is in the B.G. The CABLE CAR
ROUNDHOUSE creaks and groans behind them.

They watch the rats twitch and die on screen.

				TONY
			Man, this ain't Walt Disney.

				SARAH
				(to Fields)
			You have the data to back up what
			you're saying?

				FIELDS
			All downloaded into this baby.

				SARAH
			And what do you want?

				FIELDS
			What the hell do you think I want?
			I want protection, I want to be in
			the Witness Protection program.
			New name, new identity, the works.
			Also, maybe you could make me a
			couple of years younger on the ID.
			And send me someplace warm --

				SARAH
			That's a Federal program, out of
			my...

She breaks off as US GOVERNMENT FDA documents scroll by.

				SARAH
				(continuing)
			...jurisdiction...

				FIELDS
			...and this as you have just
			noticed is a Federal case.
			They'll play ball with you. You
			play ball with me.

She shuts the computer, puts it back in her shoulder case.

				SARAH
			Why didn't you go straight to the
			Feds with this? Why me?

				FIELDS
			Because Byron has people
			everywhere.
				(more)
			He brags about how he has bought
			cops, judges - you name it. But
			I knew I could trust you because
			Byron was watching you.

				SARAH
			Watching me?

				FIELDS
			Yeah. So I figured you had to be
			honest to make him nervous, right?

				SARAH
			Right.
				(turning)
			Tony. Let's get this lady in a
			nice pleasant lock up.

				FIELDS
			No jails! He'll find me there --

				SARAH
			A motel, hotel, something, we'll
			take turns guarding her until we
			can sort through -

But Tony is shaking his head.

				SARAH
				(continuing)
			What do you mean, no? Do you
			realize how big this -

But then she realizes that Tony is not shaking his head, he
is twitching, because (as we see now) he has been STUCK in
the BACK by a knife. He falls over into Sarah's arms, dead.
At the same moment, the BULLETS begin to ring out.

				SARAH
				(continuing; as she
				 draws, to Fields)
			Get down!

NEW ANGLE

Fields doesn't need to be told twice. She DIVES inside the
car, cowers in the footwell. Sarah lets poor Tony's body
absorb two BULLETS as she makes her way behind the open
car door. Then she KICKS the body away, at the same time
drawing Tony's pistol. Now she has one in each hand.

CUSTIS

gets hit in the arm. He YOWLS, dives for cover, crawling to
recover his gun while Diggs covers him.

RESUME CAR

				FIELDS
			You call this protection?

				SARAH
			You'll be protected, you'll be
			protected, it just didn't start
			yet! Shut that door! We're going!

Saying this, she slams her own door - reaches for the
ignition and SEES

NO KEY

BACK TO SCENE

A bullet SPIDERWEBS the side window. She breaks out the
rest, FIRES back, then looks at -

TONY'S BODY - HER POV

The KEYS inches from his open and still palm.

BACK TO SCENE

Sarah empties one gun. FIRES with the other. Ducks down
in the footwell. She loads a new clip in the empty gun,
mind racing. Then her eyes fall on -

THE EMERGENCY BRAKE

BACK TO SCENE

She sneaks a glance outside the car window toward the street.
Yep. She's on a steep hill.

She reaches over for the emergency brake. BLAM BLAM!

HER ATTACKERS

				CUSTIS
				(holding his arm)
			This bitch is gotta be empty.
			Let's do it.

He starts forward when with sudden savage SPEED something
lunges down from the darkness above and yanks him completely
skyward as quickly as a fly yanking a trout out of a brook.

Diggs runs forward, rattled.

				DIGGS
			Custis? Custis!

SCREAMS from above.

				DIGGS
				(continuing; watching)
			Jesus - !

He FIRES upward at - something. CRUNCH of BREAKING BONES
above. Then Custis' BODY falls to the ground, knocking
Diggs off his feet.

LOW ANGLE

Diggs looks at Custis' face, REACTS. Custis' head has been
twisted around backwards.

Diggs jumps to his feet, SCREAMING and RUNNING.

								CUT TO:

PRING - AT THE CAR

He HEARS this. Puzzled, he turns, looks toward the sound.

SARAH - SAME TIME

Hearing the same screams, she sneaks a look. REACTS to -

DIGGS - HER POV

running away in terror, the broken body of his partner in
the F.G.

BACK TO SCENE

As she tries to figure this out, her eyes DART over to
something up above - something leaping from one side of
the alley above her to the other -

DIGGS

running AWAY from lens toward A WROUGHT IRON GATE. Just
as Diggs glances over his shoulder (toward us) Kato drops
down behind the iron fence. And - RIPS IT OUT OF THE
GROUND.

REVERSE ANGLE

Diggs turns just in time to SEE this - raises his gun and-

SIDE ANGLE

Gets impaled on at least six of the metal spears at the
top of the fence! The fence QUIVERS like an arrow in the
wall as it settles in behind Diggs' back.

PRING - DOWN THE BLOCK

He's seen this.

				PRING
			Fuckkk... it's him... it's him...

He jumps in the car, burns rubber.

SARAH

She's seen this, too.

				FIELDS
			Well? Are we safe yet?

				SARAH
				(sotto)
			Beats the fuck out of me.

				FIELDS
			What?

				SARAH
			Stay here.

Sarah slowly (and not too eagerly) gets out of the car, gun
ready. We STAY with her as she moves forward in the gloom
and smoke of the city's night breath.

				SARAH
				(continuing)
			Whoever you are, I'm a police
			officer.
				(more)
			I'm grateful for your help.
			W-who are you?
				(under her breath)
			What are you?

OVER HER SHOULDER

The mysterious backlit form as she moves closer to it.

VERY CLOSE ON SARAH

Her hand tightens on her weapon. She's on the verge of
shooting... then...

				SARAH
			My God.

KATO - CLEARLY NOW

He looks at her. Fumbles a smile of recognition.

				KATO
			Hello... Partner.

SIDE ANGLE

Sarah holsters her gun, runs toward him, embraces him.
We TIGHTEN on her.

				SARAH
			Oh, Kato, Kato, thank God!

By now Fields has decided it is safe enough to emerge.
She looks at Kato, suspiciously.

				FIELDS
			Who the hell is this?

				SARAH
			He's my old partner.

				FIELDS
			Old partner?
				(thinking about it)
			He looks like your dead partner.

				SARAH
				(ignoring this)
			Oh, Kato, you don't know how I've
			prayed for this. It's a miracle...

But now she looks at him more critically, sees his
clothing, the bloodstains from his earlier wound.

				SARAH
				(continuing)
			You've been hurt...

				KATO
			Yes, they told me that. But I
			can't feel anything.
				(another tone)
			I can't feel anything...

				SARAH
			You... weren't released from the
			hospital, were you?

				FIELDS
				(alert)
			Hospital?

				SARAH
			What are you doing here? How did
			you know where I was?

				KATO
			Finder helped me.

				SARAH
			Our old snitch?

				KATO
			Yes. He only charged me twelve
			hundred dollars. And Ishmael said
			you were out here. Fighting evil
			and greed.
				(looking around)
			Struggling in the darkness.

				FIELDS
				(breaking in)
			By any chance could this have
			been a mental hospital?

				SARAH
				(annoyed)
			You don't understand. For two
			years he was brain dead.

				FIELDS
			Right now I'm worried about being
			all dead. I could get more
			protection from sun block!

				SARAH
				(to Kato)
			She's right. Let's take off.

				KATO
			Yes, take off. To Singapore. For
			five fabulous days and nights.

				FIELDS
			Aw, Jesus.

				KATO
			We were in love. And we were going
			on the plane. Why were we going on
			the plane when usually we just rode
			in our patrol car?

				SARAH
			I think you're confusing me with...
			with Anne?

				KATO
			Anne? Who is Anne?

As he says this there's a hint of a terrible struggle in
his mind.

				SARAH
				(gently)
			Come on. We'll go now. We'll go to
			Singapore.

He moves toward the car - the driver's side.

				SARAH
				(continuing)
			I'll drive. Your license expired.

								CUT TO:

INT. BIODYNE - OUTSIDE BYRON'S OFFICE - NIGHT

The city is visible outside. Most of the floor space here
is occupied by big DISPLAY MODELS of Biodyne's medical
equipment: MMRs, catscans, X-ray machines. CAMERA PANS to
the men around the long conference table.

Pring, hands shaking, downs coffee as he reports to Byron
and Terrell. Acer stands nearby, skeptical. Quinn and Baker
flank the elevator.

				ACER
			This is bullshit, Pring. No way
			it was him -

				PRING
			I'm telling you, it was Kato! He
			did things to Custis and Diggs...
			things no man could do.

				BYRON
			Nonsense! I put a bullet in his
			brain! He's been in a coma ever
			since -

				PRING
				(a whisper)
			Yes. Dead, but not dead. And now
			he has risen. Like Lazarus. Like...
			Jesus.

				ACER
			Pring, let's give the Bible a rest,
			okay? Next thing he's gonna pass
			the basket -

				PRING
			Hey, fuck you -

Byron stands, musing.

				BYRON
			First Fields bolts the plant, goes
			straight to Officer Weller. Now
			this. It's too... neat. What if
			that story that Kato was catatonic
			all this time was just a cover
			story? What if when Fields shows
			up Thursday for the Civicalm meeting,
			FDA agents are waiting to arrest me?

				TERRELL
			We own a cop or two. I'll see
			what they know.

				BYRON
			Check the hospital, too. The
			records there might show something.

				ACER
			We getting a little paranoid here,
			boss -?

				BYRON
				(sharply)
			Tell that to Custis and Diggs.

								CUT TO:

EXT. FAST FOOD RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Sarah and Kato are in the car, eating junk food. Fields
is in the B.G. on a pay phone.

				KATO
				(in mid-speech)
			--we answer only to the Oval
			Office. It cuts down on red tape.
			And security leaks. So we can cut
			the tumor of ennui from the body
			politic of America.

Fields returns from the phone in time to hear the tail
end of this. She rolls her eyes.

				SARAH
				(turning, to Fields)
			Dr. Fields. Everything okay with
			the... plane reservations?

				FIELDS
				(big grin)
			It's all taken care of. First Class
			seats, airphone, salt-free meal.

Sarah starts the car. Fields leans over, whispers.

				FIELDS
				(continuing)
			I got through to your Captain.
			He's on his way. The guys with
			the butterfly nets are already
			there.

								CUT TO:

EXT. AIRPORT - NIGHT

Sarah pulls up to the curb, parks.

				SARAH
				(aside to Fields)
			This could get dicey. You stay
			here.

				FIELDS
			When that psychopath Byron's got
			his hitmen out looking for me,
			you're leaving me alone?

				SARAH
			I didn't think you wanted to go
			into a public place. Fine, then.
			Come with us.

				FIELDS
			Oh, you mean with your psychopath?
			Great, fine.

They go into the building.

INT. AIRPORT - NIGHT

They move through the terminal. The usual airport characters
-Hare Krishnas, neo-Nazis with petitions, punk rockers -
all stare at Kato, who's only looking at the building.

				KATO
			They painted the terminal.

				SARAH
			You're right, they did. You
			always noticed the details, Kato.

				KATO
			Sarah.
				(suddenly slowing)
			This is the Domestic Terminal.

				SARAH
			What?

				KATO
			We should be in the International
			Terminal.

				SARAH
			It's okay, it's okay.

				KATO
			You shouldn't have let Dr. Fields
			make the reservations. She must
			have fucked them up.

He starts to walk again, then sees her eyes drifting.

				KATO
				(continuing)
			Sarah? Is something wrong?

Alert, he whirls.

NEW ANGLE

He turns just as two beefy MENTAL ORDERLIES lunge for him.
He sidesteps one, flips him into a coffee shop. The other
one he stops with an open palm to the face, then he spins
and kicks him into a Theme Park standee. It EXPLODES
around the guy.

WIDER

Now AIRPORT SECURITY GUARDS rush forward, swarm Kato. In
a second, six of them have taken him to the floor.

And - in the next second - he is flinging them away like
a lion shaking off hyenas.

SARAH AND FIELDS

Watching this, Fields amazed, Sarah guilt-ridden.

THE SCENE

Kato has a guard over his head. He THROWS him into
two others.

				KATO
				(turning)
			Partner! Cover me!

This is too much for Sarah. She turns away, even as Wykoff
appears with some uniformed cops. The bigger cop steps
foward, FIRES two TASER DARTS.

KATO

Looks down at the sparking darts, puzzled.

				COP
				(stunned)
			Fuck -

Kato YANKS the wires. They pull out the end of the Taser
and the battery overloads, shocking the cop. Another COP
JUMPS him from behind, gets one handcuff on Kato's wrist.
Kato whirls, FLINGS the guy overhead like a baseball. The
handcuff chain SNAPS and the guy bounces down an escalator.

But now the security guards and the hospital orderlies have
recovered and have joined the cops, and suddenly there's
seven, eight, nine men swarming over Kato, clubbing him,
tackling him-

KATO - LOW ANGLE

He TOPPLES like a titan, goes down. The white coats
wrestle him into a strait jacket. He looks up, confused.

SARAH

tears in her eyes, she moves forward -

BACK TO SCENE

The white coats cover Kato's face with a Dr. Lecter-type
MUZZLE. Haul him away like a trophy. Wykoff comes over,
breathless.

				WYKOFF
			My God. You were right. It is
			him. He's out of his coma?

				SARAH
			Yes. No. His... mind still isn't
			working.

Wykoff looks around at the groaning and bleeding men
and the wrecked terminal.

				WYKOFF
			His reflexes sure as fuck are
			working...

He looks over at Fields, who's trying to look scarce.

				WYKOFF
				(continuing)
			This is the witness?
				(on her nod)
			We can't check this FDA story or
			Byron's records until morning.
			Will she bolt?

				SARAH
			In an instant. She's very paranoid.

				WYKOFF
			It's the nineties. Who isn't?
			We'll get her in front of a
			Judge first thing in the morning.
			Until then she can stay at the
			county safe house. I'll make
			arrangements -

Fields has heard this last part. She darts forward, fearful.

				FIELDS
			Whoa, whoa, forget that. Byron's
			got the fix in anywhere you look.
			No offense, Ace, but Sarah's the
			only one I trust with my ass.

She puts her arm around Sarah.

				FIELDS
				(continuing)
			It's a girl thing.

				WYKOFF
			Whatever you want.
				(to Sarah)
			She's all yours.

				SARAH
			First I want to make sure Kato's
			okay.

She starts off after the hospital people. Wykoff touches
her arm gently.

				WYKOFF
			Hey. You had no choice, Sarah.

				SARAH
			Like hell I didn't.

								CUT TO:

HOSPITAL - NIGHT

Kato is still immobilized in the muzzle and strait jacket.
Clarence is supervising his admission.

Suddenly, Batish bursts in, obviously having been awakened
in the middle of the night.

				BATISH
			What's going on here?
				(off Kato's plight)
			This is criminal! I want him
			out of those restraints - This
			man is not dangerous -

				CLARENCE
			Tell that to the five officers
			down in the emergency ward.
			You've coddled this patient long
			enough, Doctor. Until he's looked
			at by a specialist -
				(stifling her)
			-not one associated with his
			case, he's going to be under
			restraint and observation.

Suddenly Waldo steps forward, upset, muscles the white
coats aside.

				WALDO
			I'll take him. He's my friend.

He wheels the gurney down the corridor.

								CUT TO:

INT. HOSPITAL RECORDS AREA - NIGHT

THUD. A GUARD is knocked out. WIDEN. Acer and Pring drag
the body out of sight. They begin to look through the
files on the rack.

				PRING
			H-J... K. Okay, um... Kato,
			here it is. He's in... room 128.

They turn, move down the hallway.

				ACER
				(off door numbers)
			130... 128.

We FOLLOW them inside. There are two beds. Julius is
sprawled on one, watching television.

				JULIUS
			Hello. Have you brought dinner?

They look at him, then the TRAY of empty dishes beside him.

				ACER
			Your dinner's right there,
			dipshit. You want my foot up
			your ass for dessert?

				JULIUS
				(thinking about it)
			Could I have Jell-O instead?

Acer grabs him off the bed, holds him by the collar.

				ACER
			Where's Kato?

				JULIUS
			Kato? Kato... Kato. Sorry, I
			can't help you. I've only been
			here one day.

Pring and Acer look at each other. Acer sees the polaroid
peeking out of Julius' pocket, takes it out. Shows it to
Pring.

				JULIUS
				(continuing)
			Where did that come from?

				ACER
			One day, huh? Then how did you go
			to a Christmas party with him?

				PRING
			The bread of deceit fills man's
			mouth with gravel: Kato's in your
			therapy group.

				JULIUS
			Oh, group therapy, I've been
			thinking of joining that.

				ACER
				(grabbing him)
			Are you fucking with us? Do you
			know what we'll do to you if you
			fuck with us?

				JULIUS
			How could I know? I've never even
			met you!

Pring groans, sits down on the bed.

				PRING
			A fool's errand. The man's a
			retard.

				JULIUS
			A retard? I'm not the one that sat
			on a dinner tray.

Pring turns, sees this is true. Steamed, he PUNCHES Julius,
who falls to the floor.

				ACER
			Come on, we'll search the whole
			place. We'll find him.

				PRING
				(beat)
			If he's a man.

				ACER
			I told you, lay off the God stuff!

A BEEP distracts them both. Acer realizes its his
cellular phone.

				ACER
				(continuing; into it)
			Yeah!

BYRON - IN HIS OFFICE - INTERCUT AS NEEDED -- NIGHT

Terrell hovers in the background.

				BYRON
			We just got the word. Fields is
			at that hospital right now. You
			can take care of her the same
			time as Kato.

				ACER
			Got it.
				(to Pring)
			Maybe there is a God.

								CUT TO:

INT. KATO'S CELL - NIGHT

Kato's back is to us. Sarah has her face pressed against
the little opening in the door, close to the CAMERA. Her
breath shows in the chilly cubicle.

				SARAH
			Oh, God, Kato, if I knew how they
			were going to handle it, I never
			would have made the call... I
			would have let you run anywhere
			you wanted to go... I only...
			want you to get better.

OUTSIDE IN THE CORRIDOR

Batish gently pulls Sarah away from the peephole, closes it.

				BATISH
			Neither of us can help him right
			now.
				(turning Sarah to
				 face her)
			And it's neither one of our faults,
			but we feel like it is anyway. Now
			what's this about your friend?

Sarah composes herself as they walk.

				SARAH
			Yes. She needs a place she can
			feel safe for the night. She
			doesn't trust the police safe
			house. Can you help me out?

Batish looks off at Fields, who peeks around the corner
of a waiting room.

While still trying to hide her face she manages a little
wave.

				BATISH
			This is a hospital, not a hotel.
			I'll have to admit her. Does she
			have any symptoms, physical,
			mental-?

				SARAH
			She thinks people are trying to
			kill her.

				FIELDS
				(coming into earshot)
			What do you mean, thinks? They
			had guns like this - knives like
			that - we barely got away -

				SARAH
				(sotto)
			See what I mean? Completely
			paranoid.

Fields looks at Sarah. She knows she's being conned, but
she knows Sarah has a reason.

				BATISH
			Forty-eight hours. That's all I
			can do. Then I have to report it.

				SARAH
			That will be enough. Thank you.

				BATISH
				(to Sarah)
			Let's get her admitted.

				SARAH
			You'll be all right here.

				FIELDS
			Your mouth to God's ears.

Sarah smiles, moves toward the lobby. Fields hides behind
a newspaper.

								CUT TO:

INT. KATO'S PADDED CELL - NIGHT

Kato sits like a statue. A shaft of moonlight comes in
through the wire and glass window. Something attracts
his attention.

OUTSIDE THE WINDOW

It's the American flag on its staff outside the hospital.

BACK TO SCENE

He looks at it, eyes pained.

				KATO
				(remembering)
			Damaged goods...

He shakes his head, enough of his mind working to know he's
been a fool. That's when he HEARS the PATRIOTIC MUSIC. He
spins around. Coming toward him out of the shadows is
Ishmael. He's wearing a walkman that's playing Sousa marches.

				KATO
				(continuing)
			Ishmael. Then... you were real.

				ISHMAEL
			Mr. Kato, you didn't complete
			your mission. Now you leave me
			no choice.

Something gleams in Ishmael's hand. A scalpel.

				ISHMAEL
				(continuing)
			I have to let you try again.

CLOSER

The SCALPEL saws through the long sleeves of the strait
jacket.

Kato looks at Ishmael carefully.

				KATO
			I think... I think you're crazier
			than I am.

				ISHMAEL
			If you're so sure you're sane...
			prove it. Kill somebody.

Kato flexes his muscles. The sleeves RIP the rest of the
way. He turns, heads into the backlight of the waiting
corridor.

								CUT TO:

INT. WAITING ROOM - NIGHT

Fields paces, nervous, aware of every tick of the wall
clock. She takes a piece of fruit from a bowl, bites into
it. It isn't ripe. She scowls, turns on the TV.

				SINISTER MAN
				(on TV)
			You shouldn'ta squealed on us,
			baby. You know what we do to
			squealers...

Fields shivers, changes channels.

				VOICE
			You shouldn't have squealed on
			us, baby. You know what we do
			to squealers...

Fields blinks, looks at the TV, confused.

TV - HER P.O.V.

One of those "Stud" dating shows.

BACK TO SCENE

Then where did the instant replay come from? She turns,
looks in the doorway. Acer and Pring are there. It's
Acer who spoke.

				ACER
			Yeah, it's a real shock, ain't it?

FIELDS

She starts to scream, but Pring has already crossed behind
her and put his hand over her mouth. But then ANOTHER HAND
COVERS HIS. Pring blinks, confused - then one of his
fingers gets SNAPPED.

NEW ANGLE

Kato has appeared behind Pring. As Pring SHRIEKS Acer
looks up, pales. The knife he had intended to use on
Fields changes course toward Kato. Kato falls onto his
back, flinging Acer over his head. Acer crashes through
the double doors of an operating room.

FIELDS

Goes running down a corridor, SCREAMING for help.

INT. OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT

Acer, mouth cut on his own teeth, rolls to his feet, drawing
his gun. He almost plugs the person who runs into the room,
but it's Pring.

				PRING
			Where'd he go?

Acer, rattled, has no answer. Both men JUMP at a sound that
might be a squeaking floor tile. Another SOUND. Now they're
spooked. Then a SHADOW makes them look up.

UP ANGLE

Kato DROPS DOWN from the observation gallery!

WIDER

He LANDS on the operating table with a CRASH, KICKS Acer
across the room. Meanwhile Pring FIRES at him, MISSES.
Kato whirls, kicks Pring's gun away. But Acer has recovered
and now with all his strength, he CHARGES the base of the
big operating light, which swings around and SLAMS Kato
down onto the table!

NEW ANGLE

As Kato lands, stunned, Acer jumps in, yanks the surgical
straps taut. Seeing this, Pring does the same thing.

Kato blinks, tries to move. He's immobilized.

				ACER
			Okay, vegetable. Time to make
			some salad.

He grabs the SURGICAL SAW, TURNS IT ON. Moves forward
with it.

				ACER
				(continuing)
			Hold the table still!

Pring obeys.

THE SAW

approaches CAMERA - and Kato's body -

KATO

strains to move something, anything. Struggling with the
effort, he bends ONE KNEE. It's still pinned down, but
it's flexed.

The saw GRAZES his torso - a THIN LINE OF BLOOD WELLS UP
-and then

END OF TABLE

Kato KICKS the appliance tray attached to the end of the
table -the bolts SNAP -

ACER

blinks. Releases the surgical saw, which SWINGS on its
gimbal. Acer looks down at his stomach. The surgical tray
is there, sticking like a Garfield window decoration. Face
ashen, Acer removes it. His belly is FULL OF INSTRUMENTS.
Before he can even absorb that, he looks up.

HIS POV

The surgical saw is swinging around from its own centrifugal
force. It comes towards the LENS -

ACER- QUICK CUT

A very quick cut, as the saw SLICES THE TOP OF HIS HEAD OFF.

PRING

rattled, he backs away from the table...

KATO

emotionless, he regards the uncontrolled saw, now swinging
toward him. He watches its progress.

Waits - and then with all his strength forces the straps
on one arm toward it. VRRRROOM! The saw SLICES through
the strap!

NEW ANGLE

Terrified, Pring backs away as, one arm freed, Kato RIPS
the other one loose, like Frankenstein escaping from the
lab. Suddenly Kato notices something.

CLOSER

Ooops. The saw cut off one of his pinky fingers.

BACK TO SCENE

Kato shrugs, continues toward Pring. Pring runs through
a door, BOLTS it. Kato CRASHES through it.

OTHER SIDE OF DOOR

CAMERA glides along the floor. Finds Pring huddled behind
shelves filled with pathology specimens, hands around a
rosary.

				PRING
				(eyes closed, rapid-
				 fire)
			He was crucified, died, and was
			buried, he descended to the dead,
			on the third day he rose again -

CRASH as a shelf is overturned. Preserved organs slide
around the floor. Then - Kato's FEET enter SHOT. Pring
looks up, terrified.

				PRING
				(continuing)
			I - I didn't want to do all those
			things - it wasn't me, it was
			Satan - I was weak and he made me
			do it-

Kato grabs him by his clothing -pulls him up to his feet
-Pring keeps his eyes screwed shut as he babbles -

				PRING
				(continuing)
			-I don't want to burn in hell please
			- please - I want to go to heaven -
			let me go to heaven-

Kato SWINGS him out of SHOT. There's a CRASH.

PRING - NEW ANGLE

He opens his eyes, looks around. Amazed. HE IS FLOATING
ON AIR. The moon is full and glowing behind him. Stars
twinkle.

				PRING
			Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus...
			Thank y-

He looks up. SCREAMS.

NEW ANGLE

He continues upward and SMASHES - into the sidewalk: For
the CAMERA is UPSIDE DOWN. Now, the CAMERA turns RIGHT
SIDE UP, CRANES UP. Kato stands in the window Pring crashed
through. Now, as ALARMS RING, Kato disappears.

								CUT TO:

INT. OPERATING ROOM

LIGHTS come up. Batish, Sarah and Fields enter with SECURITY
GUARDS. The guards RETCH when they see Acer.

				BATISH
			My God...

				SARAH
			Kato.

				FIELDS
			That's what I told you.

				BATISH
			But he's under confinement...

				WALDO
				(running in)
			Dr. Batish. Kato's gone.

				FIELDS
			Why doesn't anyone believe me?

Now a NEW, different alarm rings.

				BATISH
			That's downstairs. The office wing.

They rush out.

OFFICE WING - NIGHT

Batish, Sarah, Fields and the others race down the hall.
We follow them into an office. Clarence is there, furious.

				CLARENCE
			What's going on here, Batish?
			Your patients are taking over
			the asylum!
				(pointing)
			What's he doing in my office?

CAMERA ADJUSTS. We see Oswald, sitting behind that big desk
full of Americana. Even without the wide angle lens, we
recognize this room.

				BATISH
			Oswald. Why are you here?

				OSWALD
				("Ishmael" voice)
			I am not Oswald. I am Ishmael.
				(sotto)
			Don't tell the President I told
			you my code name.

				CLARENCE
			Out! Out! Get this idiot out!

The guards grab Oswald, who HITS the tape deck, PLAYING that
PATRIOTIC MUSIC.

				OSWALD
				(scornful)
			You're too late. You summer
			soliders and sunshine patriots,
			you don't have the stomach to make
			this country great! But there's one
			man who does, and I and the
			President have unleashed him!
			Special Agent Kato, do your duty!
				(singing)
			From Sea to Shining Sea!

Sarah and Fields look at each other.

				SARAH
			Ishmael?!

				OSWALD
				(as he's dragged past)
			Shhhhhh!

								CUT TO:

INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

Julius is being led out of the emergency room by Waldo.
Julius' head is bandaged.

				BATISH
				(to Julius)
			...and you have no idea how you
			got that bump on your head?

				JULIUS
			Bump? What bump?

He feels his head, REACTS to the bandages. Rushes to a
mirror and looks at himself, puzzled.

Fetterman comes over, taps Julius on the arm.

				FETTERMAN
			Julius, Kato just flew past the
			window.

				JULIUS
			Sure he did.

He doesn't even look. Outside the glass, Kato makes another
colossal LEAP, this time to the next building. He vanishes.

								CUT TO:

INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

Wykoff is on the phone, agitated.

				WYKOFF
			-- it's my ass, too! There's
			bodies all over the city - by
			morning people are gonna be asking
			for a grand jury -

THUD. Wykoff looks around. THUD. He looks at the wall.
It's wiggling.

NEW ANGLE

The plaster wall CRUMBLES, revealing an AIR VENT which now
PEELS OPEN with a PUNCH like a sardine can.

Kato steps into the room.

BACK TO SCENE

Wykoff pales, drops the phone. Runs toward his pistol on the
chair, too slowly. Kato blocks his way.

				WYKOFF
			Kato. Try to stay calm. You're not
			in your right mind. You -you don't
			know who your friends are.

				KATO
			Yes. And it's really beginning to
			bother me.

Wykoff tries to move away. Kato hangs on to him. We see the
effort he's putting into trying to think clearly.

				KATO
				(continuing)
			You... you knew our plans that day
			at the Pier. Tonight, you knew where
			Sarah went...

				WYKOFF
			I don't know what you're talking
			about. Let me get the hospital
			people over here to help you -
			I was just calling them -

Kato hangs onto his collar, moves to the telephone. He looks
at it, trying to remember how it works. Eureka.

DOWN ANGLE

He hits the REDIAL button.

BACK TO SCENE

				PHONE
				(dial tone, then)
			Hello, you've reached BioDyne
			Pharmaceuticals. Our offices are
			now closed. If you know the
			extension you want, press -

				KATO
				(shaking his head)
			I hate those things.
				(new tone)
			You were on their payroll. All
			along. I don't think that's
			allowed in a policeman's contract.

				WYKOFF
			What are you going to do about it?
			You're a fucking lunatic! Every
			cop in the city is looking for you
			right now! Nobody's gonna believe
			you!

				KATO
			Then... I'll make you tell.

				WYKOFF
			Bullshit. What are you going to
			do to me? The Kung Pao Brain
			Drain, where you pull my brain
			out of my head? I checked. You
			made that up, it's bullshit,
			there's no such thing!

Kato looks at him oddly.

				KATO
			There is now.

NEW ANGLE - OVER WYKOFF'S BACK

WHAM! With a blinding fast motion Kato PLUNGES HIS
FINGERTIPS UP TO THEIR KNUCKLES INTO WYKOFF'S EYE SOCKETS.
There's a sickening splat. Wykoff's body heaves once, falls
heavily to the floor while grey goop drips from Kato's hand.

UP ANGLE

As the body falls, the DOOR bangs open and other COPS rush
in, attracted by the noise.

They look at the bizarre intruder - and then their dead
superior on the floor.

				LEAD COP
				(drawing gun)
			Freeze!

WIDER

Kato handsprings to the desk and then leaps straight up
into the air, vanishing into the hung ceiling of the room.
The cops rush forward, FIRING upward.

MOVING SHOT

BOUNCING ceiling panels show Kato's progress in the crawl
space, one step ahead of the BULLETS that now SHATTER light
bulbs, create hissing LEAKS in the vents.

The bullets and the footsteps create an undulating trail
across the ceiling that ENDS at the wall here, with a
CRASH, Kato EXPLODES out of an exterior vent, sailing past
a window and then out of sight!

The CAMERA arrives at the window with the cops - just in
time to see Kato - two stories below - land and race out
of sight!

								CUT TO:

FINDER - CLOSE UP

				FINDER
			Biodyne. Yeah, I know it.

Camera WIDENS. Finder is walking along purposefully with
Kato.

				FINDER
				(continuing)
			It's on the other side of town.

				KATO
			Then why are we going the wrong
			way? I'm kind of in a hurry.

				FINDER
			Relax, you'll get there. But
			remember how it works? You gotta
			give me money first.

And saying this, Finder reaches out, turns Kato around.

NEW ANGLE

revealing that Finder has positioned Kato in front of
ANOTHER ATM.

				KATO
				(mind working)
			Oh, right. Money.

He tenses... thinks. Smiles... and goes over to Finder
and RIPS HIS POCKETS OUT!

				KATO
				(continuing; handing
				 Finder the money)
			There.

				FINDER
			Funny. Real funny...

Something distracts Finder. He moves toward

AN AUDIO/VIDEO STORE

Where some SILENT TELEVISION SCREENS play out the 11:00
NEWS. We see CLIPS of the hospital - the police station -
the safe house. A file PHOTO of Kato - the words "ESCAPED
LUNATIC."

BACK TO SCENE

				FINDER
			Shit...

He goes to the window, presses his ear against it. A
second or two is enough.

				FINDER
				(continuing)
			Jesus, man, every cop in the city
			is looking for you! I don't need
			this - you're on your own, jack.
			Weave me a basket or something.
			I'm outta here.

He disappears in the shadows.

				KATO
				(plaintive)
			But Finder... how will I get
			to Biodyne?

				FINDER
				(faint)
			I don't give a fuck! Take a
			goddamn bus!

				KATO
				(after a moment)
			Take a bus...
				(brightening)
			Take a bus!

								CUT TO:

INT. BYRON'S OFFICE - BIODYNE - NIGHT

WIDEN from the television here, showing the same news report.

				NEWSCASTER
			-- Officer Kato was retired two
			years ago when he received massive
			brain injuries in the line of duty.
			But tonight, with a San Francisco
			Police Captain among the dead, it
			may be the department's duty to
			bring down one of their own. So
			far, there is no pattern to his
			killings and police are not sure
			of his whereabouts...

CAMERA ADJUSTS. We see Byron, opening a safe in his office
wall. Terrell is nearby, loading an Uzi. Quinn and Baker
are with him.

				BYRON
			I know where he's going. He's going
			to come here.

				TERRELL
			We'll be ready. I've doubled
			security outside.

				BYRON
				(scornfully)
			Rent-a-Cops. Useless.

He takes stacks of CASH and BONDS from the safe, puts them
in a valise. Picks up the phone.

				BYRON
				(continuing; into
				 phone)
			I want the helicopter here in
			fifteen minutes. Have the jet
			standing by at the airport.

INT. SARAH'S CAR - NIGHT

She's driving, looking out at the streets.

				POLICE RADIO
			All vehicles, we have a positive
			I.D. John Kato, seen in the
			vicinity of municipal garage...

Sarah throws her wheel over, hits the gas.

								CUT TO:

EXT. BIODYNE BUILDING - NIGHT

A SECURITY SERGEANT is briefing his men. The dark streets
that converge in the distance are mostly empty. Only DISTANT
HEADLIGHTS disturb the calm. As the sergeant briefs his men,
CAMERA moves up and down the ranks with him.

				SERGEANT
			... it's a possibility that this
			suspect is en route to BioDyne at
			this moment. He has already killed
			five people, four of them BioDyne
			employees. He should be considered
			armed and dangerous and you are
			authorized to use deadly force.
			Now, we don't have a photograph
			but these should suffice...

He raises his voice a little because a DIESEL RUMBLE from
somewhere nearby is approaching. Now, he passes out
xeroxes of an artist's sketch of Kato.

				SERGEANT
				(continuing)
			...as you can see, the man is some
			sort of escaped mental patient.

CAMERA HOLDS on one particular not-too-bright looking GUARD
who stares carefully at the picture, trying to memorize it.
He makes NOTES on the edge of the picture.

				SERGEANT'S VOICE
			He's still wearing hospital clothing
			and has a prominent scar on his face,
			at six foot two, 180 pounds, he
			should be easy enough to spot.

				GUARD
				(writing, sotto)
			...hospital clothing... scar...
			six foot holy FUCKING SHIT.

The Sergeant looks at him, startled - and then SEES the
Guard's eyes looking off, wide. The sergeant turns, also
looks.

A BUS

which is the source of the SOUND that has been approaching
all along. It is empty except for the driver - KATO. Now he
violently TURNS THE WHEEL.

WIDER

All the guards SCATTER. The bus bounces over the curb and
CRASHES into the BioDyne lobby.

LOBBY - CONTINUED

The guard's station and newsstand turn into toothpicks. The
bus keeps going, right through a WALL into -

INT. LOBBY OFFICE - NIGHT

The office, in fact, of the "TRIPLE A DRIVING SCHOOL -
SAFE, SANE AND SECURE." The bus stops and Kato gets out.
Pauses to carefully close the bus door.

								CUT TO:

INT. BYRON'S OFFICE - NIGHT

The VIBRATION of the impact is felt here.

				QUINN
			...an earthquake...?

				TERRELL
			No. Him.

				BYRON
				(spooked)
			Stop him, Terrell.

				TERRELL
				(into commlink)
			This is Terrell. Shut down all
			the elevators, now.
				(to Quinn)
			If he takes the stairs he'll have
			to come through the mezzanine.
			Cut him off there.

Quinn nods, rushes out.

				TERRELL
				(continuing; to Baker)
			You're with me.

They start for the door. Terrell pauses, looks back at Byron.

				TERRELL
				(continuing)
			This is gonna cost you.

				BYRON
			I can afford it.

				TERRELL
				(smiling)
			We'll see.

								CUT TO:

INT. HOSPITAL - DAY ROOM - TIGHT ON TV - NIGHT

				NEWSCASTER
				(on TV)
			--authorities have not confirmed
			reports that John Kato is inside

Julius, Fetterman and Oswald exchange looks...

								CUT TO:

EXT. BIODYNE BUILDING - NIGHT

POLICE CARS and VEHICLES begin pulling up. SWAT officers
are putting on flack jackets, checking ammo. PAN BACK as
Sarah pulls up in her car. A COP starts to block her way.
She shows her badge, pushes the man out of her way, goes
into the building.

								CUT TO:

INT. BIODYNE - MEZZANINE - NIGHT

Kato is coming up the mezzanine staircase.

UP ANGLE

Quinn suddenly appears above, grinning. He FIRES an Uzi.

KATO

with an annoyed look, he grabs the handrail with both hands,
BREAKS it off, RAMS it forward.

BACK TO SCENE

Quinn gets STABBED WITH THE END OF THE HANDRAIL. He falls
off the steps, still impaled - dangles for a moment before
the railing SNAPS and he falls to his death.

KATO

Expressionless, he continues upward.

								CUT TO:

INT. UPPER FLOOR - NIGHT

Terrell is moving along with Baker.

				TERRELL
				(into commlink)
			Quinn, I heard shots. Come in.
			Quinn? Quinn!

He looks at Baker, who cocks his weapon. They go down a
stairwell.

INT. BYRON'S OFFICE - NIGHT

A SECRET WALL snickers down. Inside, connected to life
support equipment, is a newer hi-tech version of --
THAT BOX. Byron takes it out.

				BYRON
			My little gold mine. Come to papa.

He takes the box out. NOISES of pain inside.

				BYRON
				(continuing)
			You've been good to daddy, haven't
			you? All those wonderful things
			from your blood... your fluids.
			Your marrow. Now Daddy's going to
			reward you.

He looks off in the distance.

APPROACHING HELICOPTER - HIS POV

Lights blinking, on a beeline for this tower.

BACK TO SCENE

				BYRON
			We're going for a little ride.

He starts toward the stairs to the roof.

								CUT TO:

UPPER FLOOR - NIGHT

A SWAT TEAM comes carefully out of a service stairwell, takes
up position in a shadowed alcove. The SWAT SNIPER adjusts
his rifle on a tripod while the SWAT TEAM LEADER looks at
plans of the building.

				SWAT LEADER
				(listening to headset)
			All right. He's still heading up.
				(to his men there)
			Okay. With the elevators down, he
			has to pass...
				(pointing)
			... right through that gallery.

The sniper adjusts his aim, looks through the nightsight.

				SNIPER
			My mother could make this shot.

								CUT TO:

INT. ANIMAL LAB - NIGHT

Disturbed by the noise and chaos of the evening, the animals
are agitated, jumpy. Kato moves along in the darkness here.
Suddenly he stops.

KATO - THROUGH BARS OF THE CHIMP CAGE

With the moonlight coming in from outside it's almost a
match to his own earlier imprisonment in the padded cell.
He looks into the chimp's eyes and sees something painfully
familiar.

BACK TO SCENE

Face tightening, Kato suddenly reaches out and SNAPS the lock
of the cage. The chimp scrambles out. Meanwhile, Kato moves
down the row of cages, snapping off another lock, then
another.

THE FLOOR - DOWN ANGLE

As rabbits, dogs, mice and other creatures scurry away in
the darkness.

DOOR TO ANIMAL LAB - NIGHT

Terrell and Baker come in, guns ready. Baker suddenly JUMPS
as something brushes his head - but it is only a BIRD. They
look around the room.

THEIR POV

Movement everywhere from the skittering animals.

BACK TO SCENE

				TERRELL
				(whisper)
			Take that side.

They split up.

BOTH MEN - INTERCUT

Moving down parallel aisles, jumping every time something
moves or squeaks. Hearing a CREAK, Baker whirls.

But it's only the open door of the chimp cage, swaying.
But then something LARGE vaults a table. Baker FIRES a
BURST from his Uzi.

DOWN ANGLE

A DOG lands at his feet, dies horribly.

BACK TO SCENE
				BAKER
			Fuck.

WHAM! Suddenly Kato's HANDS lunge out from behind the
open cage door. He grabs Baker's elbows, YANKS them back
violently. There's a SNAP as both his arms BREAK as they're
forced backward through the bars. Baker SCREAMS, crucified
to the cage door, which now swings back and forth violently
as he struggles.

TERRELL

has run forward the moment he heard the shots. He comes
around the corner, SEES Kato. FIRES his Uzi.

KATO

DIVES for cover, ducking and rolling, disappears behind a
CABINET.

TERRELL

keeps FIRING, blasting the cabinet into kindling.

BAKER

through his pain has the presence of mind to see that the
door he is pinned to is still swinging and is about to
swing him into the line of fire.

				BAKER
			Terrell! Stop shooting! Terrell-
			nooooo - !

Too late. He's RIDDLED with bullets, twitches, dies.

TERRELL

rushes forward, sees Baker's body - moves behind the
cabinet - and discovers Kato on the floor, one arm wounded
and hanging useless, trying to clear his eyes of blood.

				TERRELL
				(with a grin)
			This time I'll do it right.

He AIMS the Uzi at point-blank range.

NEW ANGLE

Suddenly the lab chimp LEAPS on top of Terrell, attacking
him. Terrell SCREAMS, topples backwards onto a table.
Howling, the chimp tears at his face. Terrell rolls over
and over, finally gets both hands on the animal, flings it
violently against a wall. It falls to the floor, still.
Face torn and bleeding, Terrell remembers Kato, turns.

KATO - OTHER END OF THE ROOM - TERRELL'S POV

He's gotten to his feet, cleared his vision. And he's
coming this way.

BACK TO SCENE

Terrell remembers his gun. Looks around -

HIS GUN

on the floor. TILT UP. It's between Terrell and Kato.

BOTH MEN - INTERCUT

They race toward each other. There's a moment of suspense,
but it's only a moment because the gun is much closer to
Terrell. With a grin he snatches it up - slams a new clip
inside - aims-

				TERRELL
			You should have stayed dead the
			first time... like your wife.

KATO

The words stab at something inside of him. With an inhuman
karate scream he LEAPS. It is the most incredible martial
arts leap ever seen. He sails through the air, one leg
extended -keeps coming -and coming - and coming -

TERRELL

FIRES, too late. A bullet wings Kato's trailing foot but
then the KICK drives home, deep, impossibly deep into
Terrell's midsection. Something snaps.

TERRELL - NEW ANGLE

He's thrown against the wall with the same impact he'd have
if he'd been hit by a truck. His eyes ROLL UP. He slides
sideways on the wall... and we see his SPINE sticking out
of his back, broken.

He slides to the floor, dead, leaving the wall slick and wet.

KATO

looks down at him, then, one arm useless, one leg dragging...
he continues his journey.

								CUT TO:

EXT. BIODYNE BUILDING ROOF - NIGHT

Carrying that box, Byron comes out on the roof. A BEAM of
LIGHT hits him. CAMERA ADJUSTS to show his helicopter as
it lands. Smiling, he moves forward...

SARAH - SOMEWHERE IN THE BUILDING

She starts around a corner, draws back. More SWAT TROOPERS
move past her. When they're gone, she continues on.

								CUT TO:

KATO

foot dragging, moving slowly along. He has reached the
gallery that leads to the penthouse.

THE SNIPER TEAM - IN THE ALCOVE

				SWAT LEADER
			Wait... wait...

We TIGHTEN on the sniper.

SNIPER'S POV

Kato steps right into the cross hairs of the green night
vision shot... then... BANG

THE SNIPER

HOWLS as his sniper scope EXPLODES. He drops the twisted
weapon, hands bleeding - looks off at

SARAH - BEHIND A PILLAR

She has fired the shot. Now she ducks out of view as the
SWAT teams bullets seek her out.

KATO

realizing what's happened, he doesn't waste time. He rushes
toward the penthouse doors. Locked. He RIPS them out of the
doorframe, goes inside.

PENTHOUSE FLOOR - NIGHT

Kato moves past the display of medical equipment, reaches
the open doors of Byron's office. Empty.

				KATO
				(anguished)
			No. No.

He circles the big room, desperate.

				KATO
				(continuing)
			Nooooooo!

ROAR of a motor. Kato turns. A HELICOPTER DESCENDS into
VIEW, HOVERS just outside the glass of the penthouse.

IN THE CHOPPER

The PILOT shouts over the sound of the MOTOR.

				PILOT
			The jet is waiting at the airport!

				BYRON
			It can wait one more minute!

Byron takes an M-16 from a bracket on the wall... slides
open the window on his side of the chopper... AIMS... FIRES.

PENTHOUSE FLOOR

The bullets SHATTER the glass, seek Kato out. He DIVES for
cover behind the equipment. Glass SHOWERS on him. RICOCHETS
bounce everywhere.

IN THE CHOPPER

				BYRON
			Circle around! We'll get him from
			the other side!

The craft leans -

KATO

He's been hit again, in the side. He crawls to a new position
but now the chopper has moved and BULLETS find him there,
too. He LEAPS -

AN MMR

Kato lands behind it, bleeding from dozens of glass cuts.
His mind races. It's so, so hard to think. Then he SEES

MMR - WARNING LABEL

		"WARNING: THIS MACHINE CREATES AN INTENSE
		MAGNETIC FIELD. USE ONLY IN SHIELDED AREAS."

BACK TO SCENE

Kato reaches out. Turns it ON. The motor WHINES, the
control panel LIGHTS. Kato's HAIR stands on END.

RAT-TAT-TAT. Byron's bullets chase Kato again. Dodging
them, Kato moves from machine after machine... turns them
all on. Takes COVER behind a pillar. As BULLETS ping into
the plaster, the metal buckles on Kato's strait jacket
snap off one by one.

AN MMR MACHINE

Humming, glowing - the buckles FLY onto it -

BYRON - IN THE CHOPPER

Aims, more carefully this time.

KATO - THROUGH SIGHTS

right in the cross hairs - then

THE CHOPPER

JERKS with a frightening WHINE from the MOTOR.

				BYRON
			Hold it steady!

				PILOT
			I can't! Something's wrong!

The craft tilts alarmingly. The pilot fights for control,
looks at his dashboard.

CHOPPER DASH - HIS POV

The dials SPIN, then EXPLODE.

BACK TO SCENE

Byron and the Pilot REACT as the chopper is pulled toward
the building!

INT. PENTHOUSE - NIGHT (MODEL SHOT)

ENERGY darts from one machine to another. Ceiling fixtures
EXPLODE. The wall of glass SHATTERS as the helicopter is
pulled completely inside the building. SPARKS rise from the
chopper's SKIDS as it slides across the floor, overturning
desks and chairs, its ROTOR BLADES still SPINNING, inches
below the ceiling!

SIDE ANGLE

The chopper CRUNCHES into the row of MMRs, STOPS, its rotors
still spinning.

The dazed pilot looks up, sees Kato approaching. Tries to
draw his pistol. Kato yanks him out of the doorway, raises
him in the air. We HEAR the O.S. THWACK of the rotor blades
hitting the man. BLOOD splatters, then Kato discards the
dead meat. Moves around to the other side of the chopper.

BYRON

stunned by the crash into the building, he looks up in time
to SEE Kato's FIST smash through the glass. Kato drags Byron
through the broken window by his ankle.

Screaming, Byron grabs onto the mysterious case for a
handhold but only succeeds in pulling it out of the chopper
with him.

WIDER

The box falls onto the long conference table. Kato holds
Byron by the shirtfront, peers into his eyes.

				KATO
			Yes. Yes, I remember you.

				BYRON
			Please - don't - don't -

				KATO
			I remember my friends better. And
			what you did to them. My turn.

He pins Byron's arm under his own damaged one... SNAPS it
with his good arm.

				KATO
				(continuing)
			This is for Gomez.

Kato hooks Byron's leg with his foot, puts it on a table -
BREAKS it with his elbow.

				KATO
				(continuing)
			This is for Rossi.

Byron SCREAMS with each blow.

				KATO
				(continuing)
			This is for me.

KATO - CLOSE

Something SNAPS inside him. He SCREAMS. Grabs Byron by
the throat, SQUEEZES. Byron struggles, twitches, choking.
Then Kato turns, THROWS him -

BYRON

SLIDES the length of the long conference table - right into
that box. The metal mesh BREAKS with the impact and Byron's
head goes inside the box.

We HEAR the SOUND of something alive raging, snarling.
Byron SCREAMS, jerks spasmodically. Dies.

KATO

Looks at this, and then, hearing a SIZZLE turns to SEE

THE CHOPPER

FUEL is leaking... forming a puddle that is spreading toward
a sparking wire under the engine.

BACK TO SCENE

Kato whirls, DIVES into a catscan machine.

PENTHOUSE FLOOR - MODEL SHOT

The chopper EXPLODES.

OUTSIDE THE BUILDING

The police REACT -

INSIDE THE BUILDING - PENTHOUSE FLOOR

FIRES rage all over the floor. A FIGURE appears in the
doorway. It's Sarah. She moves through the room - SEES
bloody footprints leading to the catscan. Looks inside it.

It's empty.

Sarah looks around, sees the stairs to the roof. Heads
toward them.

								CUT TO:

INT. BUILDING - STAIRWELLS - NIGHT

SWAT officers rush upward -

								CUT TO:

BIODYNE - ROOF - NIGHT

Sarah comes out on the roof. SMOKE drifts up from the
burning floor below. She looks around - SEES -

KATO - HER POV

Teetering on the edge.

BACK TO SCENE

Sarah moves toward him, slowly.

				SARAH
			Kato...?

She looks down. His feet are on the edge of the building.
He's looking at the street. SPOTLIGHTS pan them from below.

				KATO
			Do you think I'd feel it? From
			this height I should feel...
			something.

				SARAH
			Kato, no, please - don't -

				KATO
			Dr. Batish said I could feel
			any pain anymore. She was right.
			I didn't feel this -

He indicates his various wounds. Sarah's eyes widen at the
carnage.

				KATO
				(continuing)
			Or this... but... now... I...

He turns, face showing more emotion than we've seen since
he was hospitalized.

				KATO
				(continuing)
			I - I'm starting to remember.
			And... I... I think I am going
			to feel pain... A... different
			kind of... pain I...
				(anguished)
			I don't think I can take...

He moves toward the edge. She grabs him.

				SARAH
			No, Kato, please, don't do this,
			let me help you...

				KATO
			I can't take anymore, I can't...

Sarah cups his face, tears in her eyes.

				SARAH
			Let it go, baby, let it go. It's
			okay, I understand, I understand-

He reaches out, touches her tears. Shudder.

				KATO
			Oh, God! I remember! ANNE! ANNE!

He sinks to his knees, crying. Sarah pulls him away from
the edge, holds him like a child.

				SARAH
			Shhhh. It's okay. Everything's
			going to be okay now. You're
			back, Kato. You're back.

Suddenly LIGHTS flash on them. Sarah looks up.

ROOF - HER POINT OF VIEW

The SWAT team has arrived.

				SWAT TEAM LEADER
			Officer Weller. Step back from
			the suspect.
				(pause)
			Step back from the suspect now.

				SARAH
			Why? So you can kill him?

				SWAT LEADER
			He's killed a dozen people, Weller-

				SARAH
			A dozen criminals-

				SWAT LEADER
			Move back.

				SARAH
				(defiant)
			No!

She stands, deliberately blocking their shot at Kato.

				SARAH
				(continuing)
			He's my partner.
				(pause)
			So fuck off.

WIDER

The SWAT team leader looks at his men, signals. They all
RAISE THEIR RIFLES.

				SWAT TEAM LEADER
			I'm counting to three. One.
			Two...

All the weapons are COCKED.

				SWAT TEAM LEADER
				(continuing)
			Th--

He doesn't finish the word because suddenly a HELICOPTER
swoops low over the roof, making them all dive for cover!

UP ANGLE

It's a MEDIVAC HELICOPTER with hospital markings. Now, a
LADDER is thrown down. Sarah looks at the momentarily
confused cops, grabs a rung.

				SARAH
				(to Kato)
			Come on!

They climb up.

SWAT TEAM - RESUME

They come to their senses, start FIRING.

THE CHOPPER

Rises, turns, moves out of range.

INSIDE THE CHOPPER

At the controls is Fetterman, wearing his 1950's flight
jacket. In the co-pilot's seat is -

				JULIUS
				(to Kato)
			Hi. Welcome aboard... I'm
			delighted to meet you.

CAMERA ADJUSTS to reveal Oswald in the back of the chopper.

				OSWALD
			Congratulations, Agent Kato. Your
			mission was a complete success.
			The President and I are proud,
			proud, proud.


SARAH AND KATO

REACT, look at each other.

				OSWALD
			Officer Weller, your support was
			sterling. Tell me... have you
			ever considered working for the
			White House.

Sarah looks at Kato, who slowly smiles. Sarah laughs (dare
we say it?) insanely.

				SARAH
			What the hell? Why not?

Oswald smiles, signals Julius. He pops a TAPE into the
CASSETTE player.

HELICOPTER - DAWN

As the PATRIOTIC MUSIC PLAYS, Sarah flies off with three
lunatics and her broken but incorruptable Hero.

A moment later, The Crow rises into SHOT, follows the
helicopter towards the rising sun.

FADE OUT.

				THE END
