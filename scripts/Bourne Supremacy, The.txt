               EXT. MERCEDES WINDSHIELD -- DUSK

               It's raining... Light strobes across the wet glass at a 
               rhythmic pace...

               Suddenly -- through the window a face -- JASON BOURNE -- 
               riding in the backseat -- his gaze fixed.

               INT. MERCEDES -- NIGHT

               On his knee -- a syringe and a gun --

               The eyes of the driver, JARDA, watching --

               BOURNE'S POV -- the passenger -- back of his HEAD -- cell 
               phone rings -- the HEAD turns -- it's CONKLIN --

               BOURNE returns his stare...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. COTTAGE BEDROOM -- NIGHT

               BOURNE'S EYES OPEN! -- panicked -- gasping -- trying to stay 
               quiet -- MARIE sleeps.

               INT. COTTAGE LIVING AREA/BATHROOM -- NIGHT

               BOURNE moving for the medicine cabinet. Digs through the 
               medicine cabinet. Downs something specific.

               INT./EXT. COTTAGE LIVING ROOM/VERANDA -- NIGHT

               One minute later. BOURNE moves out onto the veranda.

               MARIE pads in. Watching him for a moment. Concerned. Clearly 
               it's not the first time this has happened.

               They both look different than last we saw them; his hair is 
               longer. She's a blonde. Hippie travelers. Their cottage is 
               humble but sweet. The bedroom opens to a beach and a town 
               just down the hill. CLUB MUSIC from some all night rave 
               wafting in from the far distance.

                                     MARIE
                         Where were you, Jason? In the car.

                                     BOURNE
                         Conklin up front.

                                     MARIE
                         I'll get the book.

                                     BOURNE
                         No. There's nothing new.

                                     MARIE
                         You're sure?
                              (he nods)
                         We should still -- we should write 
                         it down.

                                     BOURNE
                         Two years we're scribbling in a 
                         notebook --

                                     MARIE
                         -- it hasn't been two years --

                                     BOURNE
                         -- it's always bad and it's never 
                         anything but bits and pieces anyway!
                              (she's gone quiet)
                         You ever think that maybe it's just 
                         making it worse? You don't wonder 
                         that?

               She lays her hands on his shoulders, steadies him.

                                     MARIE
                         We write them down because sooner or 
                         later you're going to remember 
                         something good.

                                     BOURNE
                              (softens)
                         I do remember something good. All 
                         the time. I remember you.

               She smiles. Kisses him. Leads him back in.

               INT. COTTAGE BEDROOM -- NIGHT

               MARIE getting BOURNE into the bed. Turning down the light. 
               Getting him settled. Waiting for that pill to kick in. What 
               would he do without her?

                                     BOURNE
                         I'm trying, Marie, Okay?

                                     MARIE
                         I worry when you get like this.

                                     BOURNE
                         It's just a nightmare.

                                     MARIE
                         I don't mean that. I worry when you 
                         try to ignore it.

               He hesitates. But that gets him. He knows she's right. And 
               with that opening, he's letting go. Resistance folding. Almost 
               childlike. She's gathering him in. He's letting her do it...

                                     MARIE
                         Sleep. Sleep now.

                                     BOURNE
                         I should be better by now.

                                     MARIE
                         You are better. And I think it's not 
                         memories at all. It's just a dream 
                         you keep having over and over.

                                     BOURNE
                         But it ends up the same.

                                     MARIE
                         One day it will be different. It 
                         just takes time.
                              (beat)
                         We'll make new memories. You and me.

               Silence. She strokes his face. He gives in to her tenderness. 
               He's fading. Two waifs in the dark.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. BEACH -- GOA/BEACHTOWN -- DAY

               BOURNE running in the sun. A punishing pace along the sand. 
               Moving strong. Effortless. Deep into it. Focused. The stunning 
               conjunction of sun and scenery are lost on him.

               EXT. OUTDOOR MARKET -- GOA/BEACHTOWN -- DAY

               A busy market town. Fishing town. Hippie town. Lots of young 
               Western faces. Rundown and happening at the same time.

               MARIE shopping. Filling a bag with local produce.

               EXT. ROAD -- GOA/BEACHTOWN -- DAY

               BOURNE still running, leaving the beach behind.

               INT. COTTAGE KITCHEN -- DAY

               MARIE back from the market, putting the groceries away. Almost 
               done, when she stops for a moment --

               A PHOTOGRAPH. There on the windowsill. A snapshot. Jason and 
               Marie on a beach. Her arms around him. As if she were the 
               protector. Big smiles. Young. Alive. In love.

               MARIE smiles.

               EXT. MAIN STREET -- GOA/BEACHTOWN -- DAY

               Funky busy. Colonial facades in vivid, sub-continental 
               technicolor. Loud morning traffic.

               CAMERA FINDS

               BOURNE coming out of a store with a big bottle of water. 
               He's just finished his run. Standing there, chugging away, 
               checking the scene, when something catches his eye --

               HIS POV

               THE STREET. A SILVER CAR -- something newish -- pulling down 
               the block -- can't quite see who's driving, but --

               BACK TO

               BOURNE watching this silver car. So serious he's casual. 
               Nobody passing would notice, but we do: He's on alert.

               MOVING WITH HIM AS

               BOURNE follows THE SILVER CAR on foot -- natural -- cruising 
               the BUSY SIDEWALK -- blending into the mix -- chugging on 
               that water bottle and --

               UP AHEAD

               THE SILVER CAR making the corner and turning now --

               BACK TO

               BOURNE slowing as he reaches the corner --

               HIS POV

               THE SILVER CAR has parked. There's a GUY -- well-dressed -- 
               casual -- physical -- sunglasses -- call him KIRILL -- he's 
               out of the car and heading across the street toward a building 
               there. A TELEGRAPH OFFICE.

               BACK TO

               BOURNE checking his watch. The car. The guy. Perimeter.

               INT. TELEGRAPH OFFICE/GOA -- DAY

               MR. MOHAN at his desk. He's a crisp, proper man of fifty. 
               He's just been handed something --

               A PHOTOGRAPH OF MARIE -- an old passport picture.

                                     MR. MOHAN
                         And your question, sir?

               KIRILL across the desk.

                                     KIRILL
                         She's my sister. There's been a death 
                         in the family. This is the last place 
                         we know she called from.

               INT. COTTAGE -- DAY

               A NOTE ON THE TABLE: "I'M AT THE BEACH"

               BOURNE has just come in -- just read the note -- balling it 
               quickly. In fact, everything is quickly now, because --

               BOURNE is bailing.

               Fast. Calm. Methodical. Some exfil procedure that he's honed 
               and choreographed. Packing like a machine --

               RAPID TIME CUTS

               -- BACKPACKS thrown open on the bed. -- HOUSE CASH pulled 
               from a lamp base. -- CREDIT CARDS taped under the counter.

               EXT. MAIN STREET/BANK GOA/BEACH TOWN -- DAY

               KIRILL coming out of the bank. Mission accomplished.

               Heading back to the SILVER CAR. Getting in and --

               INT. SILVER CAR -- DAY (CONT)

               KIRILL starting it up. Glancing around nice and easy. He's 
               cool. Putting the car into gear, he makes a slow pass through 
               the marketplace. Eyes everywhere.

               DELETED 14

               INT. COTTAGE -- DAY

               BOURNE -- done -- the place is stripped -- pulling on the 
               backpacks -- glancing around -- one last thing -- shit, he 
               almost missed it --

               THE PHOTOGRAPH -- the one of he and Marie on the beach -- 
               the one we saw her looking at earlier -- there it is on the 
               windowsill -- jamming it into his pocket and --

               EXT. SIDE STREET/PARKING AREA -- GOA/BEACHTOWN -- DAY

               KIRILL now parked and out of the car -- on the move -- on 
               foot -- he begins a sweep of the beach.

               EXT. COTTAGE BACK DOOR -- YARD/ALLEY -- DAY (CONT)

               BOURNE out the back -- jogging -- keeping low -- into the 
               neighborhood -- through the alleys -- nothing random about 
               it, this has all been worked out and --

               DELETED

               EXT. BEACH -- GOA/BEACHTOWN -- DAY

               Crowded with tourists -- sunbathers -- MARIE at her favorite 
               spot. Talking with TWO WOMEN, laughing with them -- happy.

               EXT. BEACH/PARKING AREA -- GOA -- DAY

               A burly JEEP comes roaring up. BOURNE spots the SILVER CAR, 
               parks at the other end -- takes off towards the beach.

               EXT. BEACH -- GOA -- DAY

               KIRILL methodically making his way up the beach -- checking 
               every blue tent -- every towel.

               EXT. BEACH -- GOA -- DAY

               BOURNE coming up the beach the opposite way -- one eye on 
               KIRILL, one eye on MARIE.

               He arrives just as KIRILL looks up and sees them a hundred 
               yards away -- a hard stare between them -- BOURNE bends down --

                                     BOURNE
                         We gotta go, Marie. We gotta go, 
                         now.

               From the tone of his voice, she knows it's serious. Marie 
               grabs her bag. A quick goodbye to the friends. They hurry 
               off. BOURNE uses the sunbathers as cover. KIRILL retreats.

               EXT. BEACH/PARKING LOT -- GOA -- DAY

               They reach the JEEP -- she knows the drill -- bag tossed in 
               the back -- even as the Jeep pulls away and --

               INT. JEEP -- DAY (CONT)

               BOURNE driving. MARIE beside him --

                                     BOURNE
                         We're blown.

               She hesitates. One minute ago everything was fine.

                                     MARIE
                         No... How?

                                     BOURNE
                         The Telegraph office.

                                     MARIE
                         But we were so careful.

                                     BOURNE
                         We pushed it. We got lazy.

               EXT. BEACH/PARKING LOT -- GOA/BEACHTOWN -- DAY

               KIRILL already back at the SILVER CAR -- following them out 
               onto the MAIN STREET -- blocked by the local traffic -- 
               pulling a HUGE AUTOMATIC PISTOL out from his travel bag.

               EXT. BEACHTOWN ALLEY/OFF MAIN STREET -- DAY

               THE JEEP pulling down this narrow little passageway and --

               BOURNE'S WINDSHIELD POV

               MAIN STREET packed with traffic and --

               BACK TO

               BOURNE not liking this. Eyes all over -- trying to decide.

                                     MARIE
                         But you're sure?

                                     BOURNE
                         He was at the campground yesterday.

                                     MARIE
                         So...

                                     BOURNE
                         It's wrong. Guy with a rental car 
                         and hundred dollar sneakers sleeps 
                         in a tent?

               Trying to decide whether to pull out or back up --

                                     MARIE
                         That's crazy.

                                     BOURNE
                         No. Not this. This is real.
                              (suddenly)
                         And he's right there...
                              (throwing the car 
                              into reverse)

                                     MARIE
                         Where --

                                     BOURNE
                         Back there -- at the corner -- Hyundai -- 
                         silver --

               INT. HYUNDAI -- DAY (CONT)

               KIRILL trapped in some Main Street gridlock. Glancing back 
               for a way out -- freezing suddenly, because there --

               HIS POV -- THE JEEP -- THE ALLEY -- right there -- twenty 
               yards back -- a good look at BOURNE and MARIE -- as they 
               disappear and --

               EXT. ALLEYWAY -- GOA/BEACHTOWN -- DAY (CONT)

               THE JEEP backing up the way it came -- BLOWING ITS HORN 
               because an OLD VAN pulls in and blocks him from behind --

               INT. JEEP -- DAY (CONT)

               BOURNE leaning on THE HORN -- shit, now they've got to wait!

                                     MARIE
                         ...but you're not -- you're not 
                         sure...

                                     BOURNE
                         We can't wait to be sure.

                                     MARIE
                         I don't want to move again... I like 
                         it here.

                                     BOURNE
                         Look, we clear out, we get to the 
                         shack, we get safe. We hang there 
                         awhile. I'll come back. I'll check 
                         it out. But right now we can't --

                                     MARIE
                         -- where's left to go? --

                                     BOURNE
                         -- there's places -- we can't afford 
                         to be wrong!

               INT. HYUNDAI -- DAY (CONT)

               KIRILL. Calm. Possessed of a familiar tactical patience. He 
               can't get the Hyundai to the alley from where he is and it 
               doesn't make sense to go on foot. He checks his rearview.

               Fuck it -- there's an opening ahead and he's taking it -- 
               even though it's away from them -- he'll find another way --

               EXT. ALLEYWAY -- GOA/BEACHTOWN -- DAY -- (CONT)

               BOURNE sees the HYUNDAI move forward into traffic.

               THE OLD VAN is still blocking them from behind --

                                     BOURNE
                         You drive.

                                     MARIE
                         What?

                                     BOURNE
                              (already squeezing 
                              over)
                         Switch! You drive!

                                     BOURNE
                         -- make the left -- toward the bridge --

               MARIE scrambling over the seat. BOURNE, eyes everywhere,  
               checks his watch.

               THE JEEP squirts back on the main street and --

               INT. JEEP -- DAY -- CONT

               MARIE at the wheel -- adrenaline pumping -- clear running 
               for thirty yards ahead and --

               MARIE skidding them into the right turn -- clipping another 
               vehicle -- MIRROR SHATTERING! -- speeding up.

               BOURNE scanning behind them -- MARIE moving out to pass -- 
               veering back! -- an ONCOMING BUS -- just in time and --

                                     MARIE
                         Jesus! --
                              (glancing over)
                         -- is he back there? --

                                     BOURNE
                         -- not yet --

                                     MARIE

                                     BOURNE
                         -- yeah -- one guy -- I don't think 
                         he was ready --

                                     MARIE
                         -- hang on --

               MARIE bearing down -- pulling out -- gives him a quick smile -- 
               BOURNE knowing he's got a good one here --

               INT. HYUNDAI -- DAY/SUNSET

               KIRILL stopping short on a rise. Bit of a view from here. 
               Gets half out the car to look.

               BELOW -- the JEEP headed for A BRIDGE. He's gonna lose them. 
               KIRILL'S mind racing. Grabs duffle from the back, abandons 
               car.

               INT. JEEP -- BRIDGE -- DAY/SUNSET

               MARIE driving. BOURNE preps his pistol. Eye out for KIRILL.

                                     BOURNE
                         You keep going to the shack. I'll 
                         meet you there in an hour. 

                                     MARIE
                              (concerned)
                         Where are you going?

                                     BOURNE
                         I'm going to bail on the other side 
                         and wait. This bridge is the only 
                         way he can follow.

                                     MARIE
                         What if it's not who you think it 
                         is?

                                     BOURNE
                         If he crosses the bridge, it is.

                                     MARIE
                         There must be another way!

                                     BOURNE
                         I warned them, Marie. I told them to 
                         leave us alone. 

                                     MARIE
                         Jason, please don't do this...it 
                         won't ever be over like this.

                                     BOURNE
                         There's no choice.

               HER POV

               The old CONCRETE BRIDGE ahead. Almost there.

               EXT. LOW WALL -- DAY/SUNSET

               KIRILL slams into it. Quick, precise grabs into the bag. 
               Only a moment and he's got a SNIPER RIFLE.

               INT. JEEP -- BRIDGE -- DAY

               BOURNE -- pistol in hand -- spare clip in the other -- checks 
               his watch.

                                     BOURNE
                         At the end make the left, when I 
                         roll out do not slow down.

               MARIE nods, got it. After a beat...

                                     MARIE
                         I love you, too.

                                     BOURNE
                         Tell me later.

               MARIE looks ahead.

               EXT. LOW WALL -- DAY

               KIRILL. Eye to the scope.

               SNIPER SCOPE POV

               There! The JEEP rumbling across the bridge. No clear target, 
               just the back of the full DRIVER'S SIDE HEADREST.

               KIRILL'S FINGER

               Squeezing. Firing.

               EXT. WOODEN BRIDGE -- DAY (CONT)

               The JEEP jerking.

               FRONT FENDER tearing into and along the guard rail -- cement 
               shards fill the air --

               BOURNE reaching for the wheel -- Too late!

               As the JEEP finally crashes through the flimsy guardrail --

               Plummets -- splashes hard -- begins to sink out of sight.

               EXT. LOW WALL -- DAY (CONT)

               KIRILL lowers the scope, takes a quick look around. He's 
               basically gone unnoticed in this little nook with his silenced 
               rifle. But people are already rushing toward the bridge. 
               Then... there!

               An OLD WOMAN looking directly at KIRILL from a doorway. Not 
               quite sure what. But an old Indian woman in Goa? So what.

               KIRILL drills her with a look. As she sinks back inside --

               INT. JEEP -- SINKING IN THE RIVER -- DAY/SUNSET

               Swallowed up. BOURNE and MARIE gone.

               EXT. LOW WALL -- SUNSET

               KIRILL scans the surface of the river under the bridge. 
               Waiting.

               EXT. RIVER BOTTOM -- DAY

               Mud plumes as the JEEP settles. BOURNE reaches over to MARIE, 
               tries to urge her out. 

               EXT. LOW WALL -- DAY

               KIRILL with a killer's patience, waiting, almost done.

               SCOPE POV

               The surface of the water. Unbroken.

               KIRILL

               Scans his perimeter. There's the old woman again. But more 
               people with her. People coming out of the woodwork.

               KIRILL checks the surface one last time. Nothing.

               He breaks down the rifle in moments -- goes.

               EXT. JEEP -- RIVER BOTTOM -- DAY

               BOURNE -- up into an air pocket held by the jeep's canvas 
               top. A big gulp of air --

               And he's back to MARIE. Frantic. Trying to unclip her 
               seatbelt. Pull her out. But it's all jammed up.

               EXT. KIRILL -- BY THE SILVER CAR

               Bag chucked in the back. All he has left is the scope. One 
               last look to the unbroken surface. Then it's time to go. 
               KIRILL -- drifting away -- disappears.

               EXT. JEEP -- RIVER BOTTOM -- DAY

               The red halo growing bigger. BLOOD. BOURNE pauses. MARIE'S 
               face is blank. She's dead. BOURNE finally pulling back. 
               Realizing this is goodbye...

               As the man comes to a CHINESE RESTAURANT he stops. Squarely. 
               So he can be seen clearly. Then he enters a STARK GLASS OFFICE 
               BUILDING.

               EXT. ZOOGARTEN SQUARE -- NIGHT

               TWO MEN cross the square to the Chinese Restaurant. VIC is 
               forty -- steel-ass intel operator -- he carries A LARGE 
               SAMPLES CASE. Beside him, MIKE, younger, ex-Navy-Seal.

               INT. BERLIN HQ/COMMAND POST -- NIGHT

               "The Hub". Secure, anonymous office space somewhere in the 
               city. Shades drawn. Lots of gear cabled around. The stale, 
               improvised feel of a temporary outpost. Four serious people 
               alone in this room:

               PAMELA LANDY is 46. A Senior C.I.A. Counterintelligence 
               Officer. Hovering over the communications console.

               KURT and KIM are the techs here. His and Her headphones. 
               Ruggedized laptops and comm gear spread around them.

               Dark. TEDDY at the window. Another military face. Radio rig. 
               Night Scope. Watching VIC and MIKE pass below him --

               VIC and MIKE slow as they come to the same STARK, GLASS OFFICE 
               BUILDING.

                         "We are ready to go."

               EXT. MODERN BERLIN STREET -- NIGHT

               MIKE and VIC shake hands; two tired co-workers parting ways. 
               MIKE will keep walking. VIC entering the building through 
               the big glass doors, smiling as he's approached by A NIGHT 
               SHIFT SECURITY GUARD. And we hear:

               MIKE still walking, alone now, heading away from THE GLASS 
               OFFICE BUILDING toward A VAN parked up the block.

               THE COMMAND POST. CRONIN works the communications board...

               PAMELA, who has been listening. Just as she's about to give 
               the final word, KIM raises a finger...

               MARSHALL, Deputy Vice-Director, he's in charge. All is tense.

                                     MARSHALL
                         I'm here. So is Donnie and Jack 
                         Weller. We understand you're using 
                         the full allocation for this buy?

                                     PAMELA
                         That's where we came out.

                                     MARSHALL
                         It's a lot of money, Pam.

                                     PAMELA
                         We're talking raw, unprocessed KGB 
                         files. It's not something we can go 
                         out and comparison shop.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Still...

                                     PAMELA
                         For a thief. A mole. I vetted the 
                         source, Marty. He's real. If it does 
                         nothing more than narrow the list of 
                         suspects, it's a bargain at ten times 
                         the price.

                                     MANDARIN #1
                         Pamela, Jack Weller here. It's the 
                         quality that's at issue... 

                                     PAMELA
                         Yes, sir. I'm in total agreement. If 
                         they're fakes, they're expensive.
                              (furious, impatient)
                         Gentlemen, I've got the seller on 
                         site and in play. Quite honestly, 
                         there's not much more to talk about.

               MARSHALL looks to his MANDARIANS. Not convinced, but doesn't 
               want to lose the opportunity. Time to wash his hands.

                                     MARSHALL
                         All right Pam, your game, your call...

               All eyes on PAMELA as she puts down the phone to Langley. 
               Nodding to CRONIN. Yes.

               INT. GLASS OFFICE BUILDING LOBBY -- NIGHT

               VIC has just passed muster with The Security Guard, he's 
               standing alone at AN ELEVATOR BANK.

                                     VIC/RADIO
                              (sleeve mike, earpiece)
                         "On my way up."

               VIC pulling his earpiece. Going dark. Waits for an elevator.

               INT. GLASS OFFICE BUILDING ELECTRICAL CLOSET -- NIGHT

               Dark. A small room full of wiring and infrastructure, lit by 
               the glare of someone's MAG-LIGHT.

               GLOVED HANDS quickly pass over racks of gear and wiring and 
               then stopping at -- the main electrical risers.

               They carefully place an EXPLOSIVE DEVICE -- no bigger than a 
               pack of cigarettes -- onto the main riser...

               Done with that, here comes A SECOND SMALL EXPLOSIVE DEVICE -- 
               but this one's special, it's being taken from A PLASTIC BAG 
               and mounted down by the floor on a sub-panel --

               Done, the hands hold up what looks like a piece of tape. It 
               bears a FINGERPRINT. As the tape is pressed down, transferring 
               it onto the charge --

               INT. GLASS OFFICE BUILDING ELEVATOR -- NIGHT

               VIC alone with THE SAMPLES CASE. Pressing the button for #9, 
               the top floor. The doors close. The car 
               rises...2...3...4...5...6... And then, it stops. VIC bracing 
               himself, as the door opens and --

               IVAN -- Russian -- the guy we saw outside with the briefcase -- 
               standing in an empty, darkened hallway.

                                     IVAN
                         Show me.

                                     VIC
                         Here?

                                     IVAN
                              (holding open the 
                              door)
                         Now. Show now.

               VIC flips open the case. CASH. Three million dollars.

               INT. GLASS OFFICE BUILDING CORRIDOR -- NIGHT

               A GLASS DOOR. A suite of offices beyond. Clean. Anonymous. 
               One light on deep inside...

               Curtains drawn. Lights low. IVAN sitting with THE SAMPLES 
               CASE, counting the cash. VIC poring over --

               RUSSIAN DOCUMENT FILES. Dozens of KGB files. Old and new. 
               Spread sheets, financial data. Incomprehensibly Cyrillic. 
               Marked up. But judging by the seals and clearance sign offs, 
               all top-secret.

                                     VIC
                         This is everything? Is there.

                                     IVAN
                         Is there. Is all there.

               Suddenly -- MUSIC -- a radio -- some tinny pop tune just 
               started playing from somewhere down the hall --

                                     VIC
                         -- what the hell is that? -- alone --

               Freaked by the gun, IVAN to his feet -- VIC pushing him back 
               as he rushes past -- THE SAMPLE CASE spilling cash and --

               Wrong.

               SNAPPH! -- SNAPPH! -- SNAPPH! -- SNAPPH! -- SNAPPH! -- five 
               fast, suppressed small caliber shots -- VIC falls first --

               The GLOVED HANDS unscrewing a SILENCER, tucking away the 
               weapon. Already in motion before we know what's happened --

               pulling a climbing duffel out from his back pack -- stuffing 
               in THE SAMPLES CASE and IVAN'S BRIEFCASE -- all the files -- 
               all the money...

               Except, wait... He's left out ONE old KGB FILE COVER -- and 
               now he pulls A PLASTIC BAG from his backpack -- GLOVED HANDS 
               carefully remove A SINGLE SHEET OF PAPER from inside the 
               bag. And this paper looks exactly like all the stuff he's 
               just tucked away; another page full of Cyrillic blur.

               He's putting this sheet of paper inside the file cover. Now 
               he's slipping them both underneath the desk, tossing them 
               there as if they fell in the struggle and --

               KIRILL enters. It's a small room. GRETKOV is waiting. He's

               Exfil procedure, but this is a heartbroken exfil.

               -- A FOOTLOCKER open. Bourne's main stash.

               BOURNE going through the footlocker. Setting aside his 'work 
               clothes' -- other things he needs.

               But he also has to separate.

               A GROWING PILE of Marie memories: Bank cards. Phony student 
               IDs. Loose passport photos with a mix of looks and hair-dos.

               A gasoline-stoked FIRE burning in a rock-lined pit. BOURNE

               fire. A passport cover crinkles back to reveal her photo. 
               Her face begins to burn. Gas-soaked clothes tossed in. Nothing

               The PHOTOGRAPH -- the picture of he and Marie at the beach. 
               The one from his desk.

               BOURNE hesitates, holds the photo out to the flames. The 
               rules of exfil say drop it -- but he can't -- won't --

               He reaches to his bag, sticks the photo on top of his gear. 
               Then, hefting, the bag, BOURNE strides away.

                         the crap. It went wrong. Conklin had 
                         these guys wound so tight they were 
                         bound to snap. Bourne was his number 
                         one -- guy went out to work, screwed 
                         the op and never came back. Conklin 
                         couldn't fix it, couldn't find Bourne, 
                         couldn't adjust. It all went sideways. 
                         Finally there were no options left.

                         I think I do. We had a deal going 
                         down in Berlin last week. During the 
                         buy, both our Field Agent and the 
                         seller were killed. We pulled a 
                         fingerprint from a timing charge 
                         that didn't go off.

                         They were killed by Jason Bourne.

                         Conklin might've been a nut, but he 
                         wasn't a mole. You have me his 
                         calendar for a couple of days, I'll 
                         prove he killed Lincoln.
                              (appealing to Marshall)
                         This is supposed to be definitive?

                                     PAMELA
                         What's definitive, is that I just 
                         lost two people in Berlin!

                                     ABBOTT
                         So what's your theory?
                              (mocking her)
                         Conklin's reaching out from the grave 
                         to protect his good name?
                              (incredulous)
                         The man is dead.

                                     MARSHALL
                              (he's heard enough)
                         No one's disputing that, Ward.

                                     ABBOTT
                         For crissake, Marty, you knew Conklin. 
                         Does this scan? I mean, at all?

               MARSHALL signals for quiet...

                         Okay, cut to the chase, Pam. What 
                         are you selling?

                                     PAMELA
                         I think that Bourne and Conklin were 
                         in business. That Bourne is still 
                         involved. And that whatever 
                         information I was going to buy in 
                         Berlin, it was big enough to make 
                         Bourne come out from wherever he's 
                         been hiding to kill again.
                              (to Abbott)
                         How's that scan?

               As the MANDARINS all start talking at once --

               ZORN enters. Stands at the head of the table. Tries to get 
               their attention.

                                     ZORN
                         Hey...
                              (they look up)
                         Look, you're not gonna believe this, 
                         but Jason Bourne's passport just 
                         came on the grid in Naples.

               ABBOTT blinks. What?

               DELETED

               EXT. FERRY BUILDING CUSTOMS HALL -- NIGHT

               NEVINS. American. A junior, C.I.A. Field Officer. Walking 
               from the parking lot, talking on his cellphone.

                                     NEVINS
                         ...what can I do? I can't. I'll call 
                         you when I know what I'm into...
                              (a hassled pause)
                         I don't know, some guy's name came 
                         up on the computer.
                              (starting toward the 
                              building)
                         So start without me, if I can get 
                         there, I will. Later...

               NEVINS hangs up and pockets the phone. He hustles towards 
               the building.

               INT. CIA SITUATION ROOM -- DAY

               The room is jumping. Agents tracking, working the phones and 
               computers. PAMELA giving orders. ABBOTT watches.

                         Looks like he's been detained.

                         There's only a Consulate, they sent 
                         a field officer out half an hour ago --

                              (cuts him off)
                         Then get a number, they need to know 
                         who they're dealing with.

               CRONIN already on it...

               INT. FERRY BUILDING HOLDING ROOM -- SUNSET

               As NEVINS flashes his credentials to CARABINIERI at door, 
               who gives an unimpressed shrug and lets him in.

               NEVINS takes his overcoat off, tosses it on the empty chair. 
               We see a big ass .45 for just a second under his suit jacket.

                                     NEVINS
                         Alright, Mr. Bourne, is that your 
                         name?
                              (BOURNE nods)
                         Name's Nevins. I'm with the US 
                         Consulate. Could I see your passport?

               BOURNE, silent, hands over his passport.

                                     NEVINS
                         So, Mr. Bourne...

               NEVINS studies Bourne's passport...

                                     NEVINS
                         What are you doing in Tangiers?

               Silence...

                                     NEVINS
                              (faux friendly)
                         Are you travelling alone?

               BOURNE stares straight ahead. NEVINS comes around the table 
               and sits in front of BOURNE.

                                     NEVINS
                              (in his face)
                         Look, I don't know what you've done. 
                         But, you're gonna need to play ball 
                         here.

               NEVINS cell starts to ring. He shrugs an apology, turns away 
               and answers:

                                     NEVINS

                         Then use extreme caution. He can be 
                         very unpredictable and violent. Use 
                         whatever means necessary to...

               INT. FERRY BUILDING HOLDING ROOM -- SUNSET

               Whatever Nevins is being told, it's concerning. BOURNE 
               watching him. Knows exactly what this is.

               CLOSE ON NEVINS as he steps away, listening intently. His 
               hand just starting to move toward his shoulder holster.

                                     NEVINS
                         Okay, I'll call you right back.

               NEVINS flips shut his phone. He reaches for his gun, even as 
               he turns, and --

               BOURNE is right there in his face. WHUMP! Momentum and gravity 
               reaching mutual agreement as NEVINS hits the deck.

               CARABINIERI barely clears his holster before -- CHOP -- CHOP -- 
               BOURNE has him down in a heap.

               BOURNE is back, silent and effective.

               Finding NEVINS cellphone, BOURNE reaches into his bag. He 
               holds the phone next to a larger, diagnostic MOBILE UNIT -- 
               the "confirm" light blinks -- Nevins' phone has been cloned. 
               BOURNE puts the phone back in NEVINS coat, takes his gun and 
               CARABINIERI'S gun and radio and puts them in his duffle. 
               We're starting to realize there's a plan at work here.

               FINALLY

               BOURNE -- exits the door, wedging a desk under the handle so 
               it cannot be opened from the inside and calmly walks away 
               like nothing ever happened --

               EXT. NAPLES FERRY BUILDING -- NIGHT

               And now we see the old BOURNE, in his long black coat, 
               purposely striding out of the building. He pauses long enough 
               for the security camera to get a good look at him.

               THE RONIN returns.

               EXT. NAPLES FERRY PARKING LOT -- NIGHT

               BOURNE crosses the street and approaches a man putting his 
               suitcase in the trunk of a green Peugeot. BOURNE reaches 
               into his bag, pulls out some cash.

               Nevins barely knows where he is.

               EXT. NAPLES STREET -- NIGHT

               BOURNE sits in the dark car. Headphones. A nest of cool 
               gadgetry -- on the passenger seat. Listening in -- recording --

               He writes: Pamela Landy -- circles it.

                         Jason Bourne is armed and extremely 
                         dangerous. A week ago, he assassinated 
                         two men in Berlin, one of whom was a 
                         highly-experienced field officer...

               We're TOTALLY ON BOURNE at this point -- sitting there in 
               the dark car, struggling to make sense of this -- what the 
               fuck is she talking about? -- Berlin? -- He writes it, circles 
               it.

                         I'm getting on a plane to Berlin in 
                         45 minutes, which means you are going 
                         to call me back in 30, and when I 
                         ask you where we stand, I had better 
                         be impressed. My mobile number is...

               BOURNE already turning the key in the ignition -- THE PEUGEOT 
               ROARING TO LIFE, as he writes the number.

               Dropping the car into gear, BOURNE pulls briskly away from 
               the curb.

                         he destroys any more of this agency.
                              (beat)
                         Is that definitive enough for you?

               ABBOTT nods. Sharing a look with PAMELA as we --

               INT. CIA HEADQUARTERS HALLWAY -- DAY

               PAMELA and CRONIN come screaming around a corner and down a 
               long corridor, ABBOTT and ZORN trying to keep up.

                                     CRONIN
                         -- Kurt's reopening all the wyfi and

                         who had anything to do with Treadstone --

               ZORN looks to ABBOTT, as they disappear around a corner...

               INT. BOURNE'S PEUGEOT -- NIGHT (CONT)

               BOURNE driving -- listening to playback of Pamela's 
               conversation with Nevins.

                                     PAMELA/TAPE
                         "Jason Bourne is armed and extremely 
                         dangerous..."

               BOURNE'S FACE -- eyes -- tight -- looking weird --

                         "...a week ago he assassinated two

               SUDDENLY

               FLASHBACK! -- a shard -- pieces -- lightning flash of images 
               GETTING IN THE BACK SEAT OF THE CAR -- rolling BRANDENBURG 
               BERLIN -- A MIRROR -- THE TELEVISION TOWER --

               THE DRIVER looks back. We see him. (We'll know him later as 
               Jarda.) Then -- A STEEL CASE on the backseat. Inside a 
               SYRINGE, A DARK VIAL, PISTOL. As we lay hands on them --

               BACK TO

               BOURNE out of it -- jolted! -- almost losing control of the 
               car for a second -- jerking back into his lane, -- recognition -- 
               toughing it out -- Steady as she goes --

               Catching his rhythm again. Accelerating and ---

               EXT. BAKERY -- PORTOBELLO ROAD -- DAY

               A BAKERY on the corner. NICKY emerging. Nicky from the old 
               days. Suddenly, she stops --

               ABBOTT stands there beside a parked car. The passenger door 
               open. Message clear. Get the fuck in.

               INT. US AIR FORCE BASE, ENGLAND -- DAY

               Inside a hanger. Inside an office. ABBOTT watching as CRONIN 
               questions NICKY. PAMELA sits on a window sill.

                                     CRONIN
                         So your cover at the time was what?

                                     NICKY
                         That I was an American student in 
                         Paris.

                                     CRONIN
                         What exactly did your job with 
                         Treadstone in Paris consist of?

               Nicky looks to Abbott. He nods that it's okay to answer. 
               Pamela bristles at the check-off.

                                     NICKY
                         I had two responsibilities. One was 
                         to coordinate logistical operations. 
                         The other was to monitor the health 
                         of the agents, to make sure they 
                         were up to date with their 
                         medications.

                                     CRONIN
                         Health, meaning what?

                                     NICKY
                         Their mental health. Because of what 
                         they'd been through. They were prone 
                         to a variety of problems.

                                     PAMELA
                              (losing patience)
                         What kind of problems?

                                     NICKY
                         Depression. Anger. Compulsive 
                         behaviors. They had physical symptoms -- 
                         headaches -- sensitivity to light --

                                     PAMELA
                         Amnesia?

                                     NICKY
                         Before this? Before Bourne? No.

               NICKY gets agitated. ABBOTT steps in, fatherly, good cop.

                                     ABBOTT
                         Were you familiar with the training 
                         program?

                                     NICKY
                         The details? No. I mean, I was told 
                         it was voluntary. I don't know if 
                         that's true or not, but that's what 
                         I was told.
                              (a bit defensive)
                         Look, they took vulnerable subjects, 
                         okay? You mix that with the right 
                         pharmacology and some serious behavior 
                         modification, and, I don't know, I 
                         mean, I guess anything's possible.

               ZORN arrives from outside.

                                     ZORN
                         The jet's ready.
                              (points to Nicky)
                         There's a car for you.

               Everybody moving. NICKY relieved. She's off the hook. She 
               thinks. She becomes aware of PAMELA considering her.

                                     NICKY
                         Good luck.

                                     PAMELA
                         You were his local contact. You were 
                         with him the night Conklin died. 
                         You're coming with us.

               EXT. PRIVATE JET -- DUSK

               Streaks across the sky.

               INT. PRIVATE JET -- NIGHT

               Quiet in the cabin. ABBOTT gets up to use the bathroom. PAMELA 
               sits across from NICKY who stares out the window. As the 
               bathroom door clicks shut, PAMELA seizes the privacy. 

                                     PAMELA
                         I'm curious about Bourne. Your 
                         interpretation of his condition. You 
                         have specific training in the 
                         identification and diagnosis of 
                         psychological conditions?

                                     NICKY
                         Am I a doctor, no, but...

                                     PAMELA
                         Are you an expert in amnesia?

                                     NICKY
                         Look, what do you want me to say? I 
                         was there. I believed him.

                                     PAMELA
                         Believed what?

                                     NICKY
                         I believed Jason Bourne had suffered 
                         a severe traumatic breakdown.

                                     PAMELA
                         So he fooled you.

                                     NICKY
                              (frustration building)
                         If you say so.

                                     PAMELA
                              (leans in; still low)
                         Not good enough. You're the person 
                         who floated this amnesia story.
                              (shifts gears)
                         Ever feel sorry for him? For what 
                         he'd been through?

                                     NICKY
                         You're making it out like we're 
                         friends here or something. I met him 
                         alone twice.

                                     PAMELA
                         You felt nothing? No spark? Two young 
                         people in Paris? Dangerous missions? 
                         Life and death?

                                     NICKY
                              (incredulous)
                         You mean, did I want a date?

                                     PAMELA
                         Did you?

                                     NICKY
                         These were killers. Conklin had them 
                         all jacked up. They were Dobermans.

                                     PAMELA
                         Some women like Dobermans --

                                     NICKY
                         What do you want from me? I was 
                         reassigned. I'm out.

                                     PAMELA
                         See, that's a problem for me, Nicky. 
                         Whatever he's doing, we need to end 
                         it. This isn't the kind of mess you 
                         walk away from.

               PAMELA leans away. NICKY looks back out the window.

               EXT. TARMAC -- BERLIN AIRPORT -- NIGHT

               Three in the morning as the GULF STREAM lurches to a stop.  
               TWO BLACK SEDANS here for the pickup. TEDDY the greeting 
               party as --

               PAMELA, CRONIN, ABBOTT, ZORN and NICKY disembark --

               EXT. BERLIN STREET -- NIGHT

               The SEDANS making their way, stopping at a non-descript office 
               building.

               INT. BERLIN HQ/COMMAND POST -- NIGHT

               ELEVATOR opens into their 9th floor world. Emergency activity. 
               KIM ready to debrief, KURT work the computers. Energy up. 
               PAMELA, ABBOTT and CRONIN bring NICKY into the room.

                                     KIM
                         -- so far Bourne's had no contact 
                         with anyone on the list -- Langley 
                         pulled an image out of Naples, it's 
                         uploading right now.

                                     KURT
                         Coming in now...

               Everything stops, as THE PHOTO -- blurry, oblique -- begins 
               materializing on HALF-A-DOZEN MONITORS around the room. 
               Suddenly, they're surrounded by Bourne.

                                     PAMELA
                              (to Nicky)
                         Is it him?

               Looking closer -- she nods...

                                     CRONIN
                         He's not hiding, that's for sure. 
                         Why Naples?

                                     ZORN
                         Why now?

               PAMELA has gone quiet, just staring at the picture, as --

                                     KURT
                         Could be random.

                                     CRONIN
                         Maybe he's running.

               ABBOTT looks skeptical.

                                     ABBOTT
                         On his own passport?

                                     KIM
                              (the image)
                         What's he actually doing?

                                     CRONIN
                         What's he doing? He's making his 
                         first mistake...

               And then, from behind them --

                                     NICKY
                         It's not a mistake.
                              (everyone looks over)
                         They don't make mistakes. And they 
                         don't do random. There's always an 
                         objective, always a target.
                              (beat)
                         If he's in Naples, on his own 
                         passport, there's a reason.

               PAMELA turns to ABBOTT. A silent moment between them. They're 
               in it now and they know it.

               The girls looking up to see --

                                     THE DOORMAN
                              (standing there)
                         [Can he walk?]

               KIRILL stirs. His stupor a futile attempt to escape. Eyes 
               still those of an exceptionally hard man.

               A minute later. KIRILL can walk. The most graceful drunk 
               you've ever seen. Making his way through the club. Tuning 
               out everything but the need to get to THE DOOR and --

               EXT. MOSCOW NIGHTCLUB -- DAY (CONT)

               Yes, day. It's nine a.m. KIRILL suddenly in the sunlight. 
               People going to work. Kids off to school and --

               GRETKOV sitting in his Mercedes, not happy.

               FOLLOW CAR and SECURITY and ASSISTANT equally unhappy.

                                     GRETKOV
                         [You told me Jason Bourne was dead.]

               KIRILL blinking against the sunlight -- trying to process.

               EXT. ANONYMOUS MUNICH NEIGHBORHOOD -- DAY

               Discreet and chilly. A car pulls up. A MAN gets out.

                                          MUNICH

               We don't see his face as he heads in.

               INT. JARDA'S HOUSE FOYER/KITCHEN -- DAY

               The man enters. His alarm system -- beep...beep -- starts 
               once he comes through the door. There's A KEYPAD on the wall. 
               He enters his code and the beeping stops. Just like everyday. 
               It's a sad house.

               He hangs his coat on the rack. Moving now --

               INTO

               THE KITCHEN. He drops his briefcase on the table, opens the 
               fridge for a drink. Except what he comes out with is --

               A GUN!

               Wheeling around. The salaryman is JARDA. JARDA from Bourne's 
               dream. But as he turns --

               BOURNE behind him. Bigger gun. Waiting. So ready.

                                     BOURNE
                         I emptied it.

                                     JARDA
                              (a total pro)
                         Felt a little light.

                                     BOURNE
                         Drop it.

               JARDA lets the gun fall, looks his old comrade over a beat. 

               But Bourne's not interested in a reunion.

                                     BOURNE
                         Here...

               Bourne tosses him FLEXCUFFS -- JARDA puts his hands behind 
               his back, turns to let BOURNE cinch them.

                                     BOURNE
                         Front. Use your teeth.

                                     JARDA
                              (caught scamming)
                         Sorry. Old habits.

               BOURNE kicks over a chair. Sit.

                                     JARDA
                         Word in the ether was you'd lost 
                         your memory.

               BOURNE checking JARDA'S briefcase -- tearing through it --

                                     BOURNE
                         You still should've moved.

                                     JARDA
                         I like it here.
                              (a beat)
                         Last time I saw you was Greece. You 
                         had a good spot.

               BOURNE reacts -- doesn't look over -- but realizes...

                                     JARDA
                         I had the girl. I had her lined up 
                         that whole afternoon. Waiting for 
                         you, that was the problem.
                              (defensive)
                         You ever do two targets? It's tough.

               BOURNE turns. Cold.

                                     JARDA
                              (his real question)
                         So why didn't you kill me then?

                                     BOURNE
                         She wouldn't let me.
                              (beat)
                         She's the only reason you're alive.

               Silence. JARDA down a peg. Or two.

                                     JARDA
                         What do you want?

                                     BOURNE
                         Conklin.

                                     JARDA
                         He's dead.

               BOURNE -- the gun -- right to Jarda's face --

                                     BOURNE
                         Try again.

                                     JARDA
                         Shot dead in Paris. Dead the night 
                         you walked out.

                                     BOURNE/PHONE
                         Then who runs Treadstone?

                                     JARDA
                         Nobody. They shut it down. We're the 
                         last two. It's over...
                              (not finishing because --)

               -- he's falling! -- landing hard -- BOURNE just kicked the 
               chair out from under him --

                                     BOURNE
                         You're lying. If it's over, why are 
                         they after me?

                                     JARDA
                         I don't know.

                                     BOURNE
                         Who sent you to Greece?

                                     JARDA
                         A voice. A voice from the States. 
                         Someone new.

                                     BOURNE
                         Pamela Landy?

                                     JARDA
                         I don't know who that is.

                                     BOURNE
                         What's going on in Berlin?

                                     JARDA
                         I don't know! Why would I lie?

               Silence. BOURNE pulls back. Unsure.

               JARDA makes it to his feet.

                                     JARDA
                         What the hell did you do? You must 
                         have really screwed up.

               BOURNE doesn't know. He backs off.

                                     JARDA
                         She really did that? Told you not to 
                         kill me?
                              (beat)
                         I had a woman once. But after a while, 
                         what do you talk about? I mean, for 
                         us. The work. You can't tell them 
                         who you are...

                                     BOURNE
                         I did.

               JARDA hesitates. It's really like Bourne just told him how 
               much he loved her.

                                     JARDA
                         I thought you were here to kill me.

               Something in the way he said it. Plus Jarda just glanced at 
               his watch.

                                     BOURNE
                         What did you do?

               JARDA shrugs, almost embarrassed. BOURNE looks across to the 
               alarm pad Jarda hit on the way in. Voltage -- like a switch.

                                     BOURNE
                         You called it in?

                                     JARDA
                         I'm sorry.

                                     BOURNE
                         How long? How long do I have --

                         his life, strangles him, then blows 
                         the place up?
                              (at Nicky)
                         For someone with amnesia, he certainly 
                         hasn't forgotten how to kill, has 
                         he?

               Across the room -- CRONIN and TEDDY suddenly excited about 
               what they're seeing on THEIR SCREEN --

                                     CRONIN
                         -- hey! -- they've got him boxed in! --
                              (new data coming up 
                              on the monitor)

               Everyone rushing to look. Excited, except --

                                     ZORN
                         Forget it. They lost him.

                                     TEDDY
                         What're you talking about? They've 
                         got a three block perimeter.

                                     ZORN
                         You can't see him? He's not in front 
                         of you? Forget it. He's gone.

                                     CRONIN
                              (fuck you, buzzkill)
                         It's not gonna be like last time.

                                     ZORN
                         You better start listening to someone. 
                         Cause we've been there.

                                     ABBOTT
                         Okay, enough...
                              (stepping in)
                         Take a walk, Danny. Get some air.

               Zorn nods. Happy to.

                                     NICKY
                              (piping in)
                         I don't think we need to keep looking 
                         for him anyway.

                                     PAMELA
                         And why is that?

                                     NICKY
                         Because he's doing just what he said 
                         he'd do. He's coming for us.

               And for the first time they're all thinking the same thing.

               EXT. HOTEL BRECKER -- BERLIN -- NIGHT -- RAIN

               It is pouring rain. Seen from that Hellish car, A HUGE, 
               DISTINCTIVE, NEEDLE-LIKE TOWER dominates the skyline, lights 
               flashing through the dark and wet --

               INT. THE AUDI/REST-STOP -- NIGHT

               BOURNE'S EYES OPENING! -- heart pounding -- springing up -- 
               alone -- damn, his side hurts -- recoiling from that -- where 
               is he? -- he's in the car -- looking around and --

               HIS WINDSHIELD POV

               AN AUTOBAHN REST-STOP. Gas station. Sleeping trucks.

               BACK TO

               BOURNE catching his breath -- shifting away from the pain in 
               his rib -- checking his watch -- but what the hell is that 
               on his sleeve? -- fuck, it's BLOOD -- JARDA's blood --

               EXT. AUTOBAHN REST-STOP -- NIGHT

               BOURNE out of the car fast -- careless -- wrong -- not even 
               checking who's watching -- pulling off the shirt -- tearing 
               it off -- throwing it down and --

               Standing there. In the weird light. A big bruise ripening on 
               his side. Looking around.

               It's okay. Nobody's watching. But, shit, man...

               Get it together.

               INT. PEUGEOT -- AUTOBAHN -- NIGHT

               Streaking along. BOURNE back to his mission.

               Roaring by a SIGN: Berlin 75 KM.

               INT. MOSCOW AIRPORT -- NIGHT

               KIRILL striding through the terminal. Moving quickly toward

               THE CAMERA FINDS

               GRETKOV above. Watching him go.

               BOURNE drives up.

               DELETED

               INT. BERLIN TRAIN STATION -- DAWN

               Quiet and forlorn this early. Just like BOURNE who's taking 
               A LOCKER. Stashing A BACKPACK. Prepping the evac. Always 
               ready. He heads outside, we hear:

               BOURNE tucked in with a BERLIN GUIDE BOOK, a felt tip pen, 
               and a Fifty-Euro phonecard. Working it.

               Clean and plain. A bed nobody's slept in. THE PHONE begins 
               ringing. PAMELA, fresh from the shower, rushing out from the 
               bathroom to answer it --

               INT. BERLIN TAXI -- DAWN (CONT)

               BOURNE in the backseat. Staring out the window and --

               HIS POV

               THE FERNSEHTURM looming as they pass, the Berlin TV Tower. 
               That needle in the sky. From the flashback. And then --

               SUDDENLY

               FLASHBACK! -- it's raining -- we're still moving -- still in 
               a car -- still near Alexanderplatz, but suddenly it's pouring 
               outside -- turning back, we realize we're not in the cab 
               anymore -- there's A DRIVER up front, and beside him...

               CONKLIN! -- yes, Conklin -- he's in the passenger seat -- 
               turning back to us -- handing us something -- A PHOTOGRAPH -- 
               a face -- some guy --

                              (beat)
                         Say it.

               BOURNE -- Treadstone Bourne -- alone in the back -- staring 
               at the photo --

                         This is not a drill, soldier. We're 
                         clear on that? This is a live project 
                         and you are go. Training is over.

                         Pull over, he's getting out.

               BACK TO

               BOURNE sitting in the back seat of the cab. Frozen there. 
               Rocked. What's happening to him? No chance to work it out, 
               because the taxi's stopped and --

                                     TAXI DRIVER

               INT. BERLIN WESTIN GRAND HOTEL LOBBY -- EARLY MORNING

               Concentric rings looking down on each other. BOURNE slipping 
               in unnoticed, taking a quick look up before moving along.

               INT. HEALTH CLUB -- GRAND HOTEL -- DAY

               BOURNE stepping up to the GUY behind the desk. The gym mostly 
               empty.

                                     BOURNE
                         Hi. I think I left my backpack here 
                         yesterday. Black, Nike.

               The guy disappears in back to check.

               BOURNE leans across the counter, scrolling the COMPUTER --

               the guest list -- his finger stabbing down on...

               SCREEN: Landy, Pamela 413.

               BOURNE clears the screen, walks away.

               INT. CONCENTRIC RINGS -- GRAND HOTEL -- DAY

               Because of the set-up, Bourne, pretending to talk on a house 
               phone, has a view of ROOM 413 across the way. The door opens, 
               PAMELA exits, carrying an overnight bag --

               BOURNE watches.

               A BLACK SUBURBAN at the curb. CRONIN standing there waiting,

                         No. Munich's a bust. He's loose.

                         I told everyone they had an hour -- 
                         eat, sleep, shave, whatever they 
                         want, but once we're back, we're 
                         back for good.

               KIRILL walks down the same hallway Gretkov came to meet him 
               last time.

               A GUY carrying a briefcase toward him. Stopping for a moment 
               to light a smoke. Letting KIRILL take charge of the briefcase. 
               Smooth. Like it never happened --

               The SUV rolling up. The CAB continuing past and stopping at

               BOURNE looking back out the rear window.

               HIS POV

               As they pile out of the van, start inside. Acknowledged by a 
               SECURITY DETAIL pretending to loiter outside. As we hear:

               A bulkhead opening. BOURNE stepping out among the satellite 
               dishes. Unpacks a bag: telescope, water, food, and we hear:

               A decent view into the Berlin HQ. Two windows. One offers a 
               look at an empty kitchenette. The other, a nice shot of the 
               bullpen area. It looks like they are in for the long haul. 
               There's TEDDY pacing past... a glimpse of ZORN conferring 
               with ABBOTT... now KIM talking on the phone.

               EXT. BERLIN ROOFTOP -- DAY

               BOURNE -- eyes locked on the target. Scanning. Waiting.

               And then, something changes. Suddenly, there's something 
               down there that's clearly a great deal more electric than 
               what he's seen so far --

               NICKY! -- she's just come into the kitchenette -- pouring 
               herself a cup of coffee. Nicky who he knows. And --

               Before PAMELA can pour, her cell phone rings. She answers.

               NICKY reacts to the name. Runs to the other room to try and 
               start a trace.

                         I want to come in.

               He wants to come in! -- it's like a bomb going off -- NICKY 
               back in with Conklin -- PAMELA waving for a pencil.

                         Okay, how do you want to do it?

                                     BOURNE
                         I want someone I know to take me in.

                         There was a girl in Paris. Part of 
                         the program. She used to handle the 
                         medication.

               AND NOW WE STAY WITH

               PAMELA -- her eyes flicker over to NICKY.

               Busted.

               As the bulkhead door swings in the wind -- BOURNE is gone.

               INT. BULLPEN -- BERLIN HQ/COMMAND POST -- DAY

               Everyone gathered. A big, detailed MAP of ALEXANDERPLATZ 
               spread on the table.

                         Hold on -- he said he wants to come 
                         in.

                                     ABBOTT
                         My ass he does. You're playing with 
                         fire, Pamela. Marshall said nail him 
                         to the wall. I don't know how you 
                         interpreted that, but I don't think 
                         he meant repatriate him.

                                     PAMELA
                         Don't you want answers?

                                     ABBOTT
                         There are no answers. There's either 
                         Jason Bourne alive or Jason Bourne 
                         dead. And I for one would prefer the 
                         latter. And what about her?
                              (points to Nicky)
                         You just send her out to this lunatic 
                         with no protection?

               PAMELA looks to NICKY.

                         What do you think? Is he coming in?

                                     NICKY
                         I don't know. He was sick. He wanted 
                         out. I believed him.

                                     PAMELA
                         Alright...

               PAMELA gestures to ABBOTT, CRONIN, TEDDY.

                         ...make the call. Get a wire on her. 
                         If it starts to go wrong, take him

               around nervously. Nothing happens. The TRAM moves about 500 
               yards across the PLATZ. Stops at the next stop. People get 
               on and off. NICKY and DELTA DUDE relax a bit. Doors begin to 
               close.

               And just like that, BOURNE swoops in beside NICKY! Flashes a 
               gun.

                         How do they know that? How can they 
                         know any of that?

                         I want to hear it from you.

               She looks at him. Is he crazy? What?

                         Last week an Agency field officer 
                         went to make a buy from a Russian 
                         national.

                         It was Pamela Landy's op. The guy 
                         was going to sell-out a mole or 
                         something. I haven't been debriefed 
                         on exactly what it was.

               Is she supposed to answer? -- Nicky shrugs -- on quicksand.

                         And you got to him before we could.

                         didn't go off! There was a partial 
                         print, they tracked it back to 
                         Treadstone! They know it's you!

                         hard to trace down there.

               PAMELA turns, looking at the photo of BOURNE in Naples. 
               Introspective.

                         So what's he doing? You believe him?

                         The confusion -- the amnesia -- but 
                         he keeps on killing? It's more 
                         calculated than sick.
                              (real soft sell)
                         What about Nicky? She's the last one 
                         to see Bourne in Paris. She's the 
                         one he asks for. They disappear...

                                     PAMELA
                         Well, whatever he's doing, I've had 
                         enough -- this is now a search and 
                         destroy mission.
                              (turns to the room)
                         I want the Berlin police fully briefed 
                         and --

                         supposed to go off simultaneously. 
                         The second one, the one that didn't 
                         go off, was down here...

                         First of all, this is nothing, it's 
                         a sub-line for the breaker above. 
                         Second, why put the charge all the 
                         way down here? If you're good enough 
                         to get in here and handle the gear, 
                         you're good enough to know you don't

               He pulls A KNIFE from his pocket.

               Checks the hallway. He's clear. Wedges the blade in there

               PAMELA jumping out of A VAN the moment it stops. Seeing it 
               all. The crowd. The army of cops. The searchlights playing 
               across THE HOTEL FACADE. It's another disaster.

               INT. HOTEL BRECKER LOBBY -- NIGHT

               KIRILL wants to get upstairs -- he can't -- TOO MANY GUESTS

               PAMELA and CRONIN listening to TEDDY who just got the police 
               update --

                                     TEDDY
                         Black coat, possibly leather. Dark

                              (pointing now --)
                         He says they're gonna try and corral 
                         the guests on the street over there, 
                         and then check them out, but...

                              (disgusted)
                         Yeah, that'll work...What the hell 
                         was he doing here?

                         Maybe he just needed a place to spend 
                         the night?

                         I want to look at the room.

                         Check it out.

               PAMELA'S in charge now. They enter the elevator.

               EXT. STREET BEHIND THE HOTEL BRECKER -- NIGHT

               BOURNE coming around the other side of the hotel --

               Stepping to the left before he spots the SWAT van --

               BOURNE about-faces -- heads the other way --

               A SIDEWALK COP looks over, checks the BOURNE PHOTO print out 
               in his hand.

               EXT. STREET OUTSIDE THE HOTEL BRECKER -- NIGHT

               TEDDY huddled with the HOTEL MANAGER and A GROUP OF HIGH

                                     ABBOTT
                              (arriving breathless)
                         They missed him?

                                     TEDDY
                         So far. But they found Nicky. She's 
                         back at the Westin. Bourne let her 
                         go.

                                     ABBOTT
                         He let her go? Great. Where's Danny? 
                         He should head over there and debrief 
                         her.
                              (the Hotel)
                         What's here? What was he doing?

                         We don't know. They're in a room 
                         upstairs. I was told to wait down 
                         here.

               ABBOTT accepting that. Because he has to. Only we see the 
               fear. Turns to leave...

                                     ABBOTT
                         OK, if you see Danny tell him I went 
                         back to the hotel.

               BOURNE striding away and -- Following --

               SIDEWALK COP blowing a WHISTLE -- fumbling for his holster.

               BOURNE running now, slowly at first, and --

               Now FASTER, as if he can gauge his speed and distance...

               MOTION -- BOURNE tearing away and --

               EXT. BIGGER BERLIN STREET -- NIGHT

               BOURNE slows to a walk -- TWO PATROL CARS heading his way -- 
               no choice -- there -- a narrow passageway between TWO MOVING 
               TROLLEY TRAINS and -- SPRINTING through --

               The PATROL CARS skidding into 180's.

               EXT. BERLIN BRIDGE -- NIGHT

               THE RIVER SPREE lit by THE TROLLEY that's rumbling past and 
               the running lights of a DOUBLE COAL BARGE up the river.

               BOURNE runs across the bridge -- going as fast as he can -- 
               hearing THE POLICE SIRENS swirling behind him, when --

               A THIRD AND FOURTH POLICE CAR AHEAD!

               BOURNE turns hard for a STAIRWELL, jumps the walkway curb, 
               leaps up the stairs, two at a time, as --

               All FOUR COP CARS SKID to a stop. As doors open --

               EXT. TRAM PLATFORM -- BERLIN BRIDGE -- NIGHT

               A TRAM waiting as the LAST FEW PASSENGERS get on. The

               doors seem to stay open in slow motion as --

               BOURNE appears -- makes a mad last dash --

               And he's on! And the doors don't close! It's not scheduled 
               to go yet.

               And here come the COPS!

               BOURNE off the tram -- GUNS appear --

               BOURNE runs to his left -- stops short --

               The other cops are coming this way -- SCREAMING at him --

               Not a lot of options -- BOURNE looks over the rail --

               DOWN BELOW

               A COAL BARGE passing, the prow just emerging --

               BOURNE

               On the rail and JUMPING even as the FIRST SHOT is fired --

               EXT. DOUBLE COAL BARGE -- NIGHT

               BOURNE lands hard -- stands -- voltage going up one leg --

               And they're SHOOTING at him.

               He can worry about the leg later. He RUNS.

               Back toward them!

               The barge moving slow -- BOURNE disappears under the bridge.

               EXT. BERLIN BRIDGE -- NIGHT

               Guns aimed, POLICE waiting for a clear shot. TWO OF THEM 
               DASH to watch over the other side.

               EXT. UNDER THE BRIDGE -- NIGHT

               Countering -- the barge going one way -- BOURNE the other -- 
               dodging all the super-structure on deck -- all the while 
               keeping his cover overhead --

               And LEAPING to the second barge!

               And more of the same, until --

               BOURNE running out of barge --

               LEAPING back onto the BRIDGE FOOTING and --

               EXT. BERLIN BRIDGE -- NIGHT

               THE POLICE watching the barge fully emerge -- continuing 
               down river -- SHOUTING IN GERMAN that he's either "in the 
               water" or "hiding on the barge".

               Off they go -- down the stairs --

               Leaving the PASSENGERS on the tram blinking out in shock --

               And BOURNE -- climbing back over the rail --

               Limping back on the tram just before --

               The DOORS CLOSE -- and off it goes --

               EXT. NEXT BRIDGE DOWN -- NIGHT

               POLICE converge from both ends -- Barge goes under as KIRILL 
               arrives at the center of the bridge -- missed again -- behind 
               KIRILL, a train snakes off into the night... 

               INT. ROOM #645 -- HOTEL BRECKER -- NIGHT

               PAMELA and CRONIN move into the living room. A couple of 
               COPS in the hallway outside.

                                     CRONIN
                         The room he checked into was across 
                         the hall -- why, why would he come 
                         here?

               PAMELA glances around -- something bothering her about this 
               space --

                                     PAMELA
                         He must've had a reason. That's how 
                         they were trained.

               CRONIN moves around the bedroom, then into the bathroom and --

                         Pam, you need to see this.

               PAMELA moves in behind him.

                                     CRONIN
                         Who's Neski?

               Both of them staring.

                                     PAMELA
                              (thinking)
                         Alright... take it down.

                                     CRONIN
                         What?

                                     PAMELA
                         This stays between you and I.
                              (sensing confusion)
                         We finally have an edge. I don't 
                         want to lose it.

               EXT. CATHEDRAL PLAZA -- NIGHT

               Very late -- ABBOTT waits on an isolated bridge -- a lone 
               Figure in the shadow of East Berlin.

               GRETKOV arrives by car. Walks through the darkness. ABBOTT 
               barely glancing over.

                                     ABBOTT
                         You told me Bourne was dead.

                                     GRETKOV
                         There was a mistake.

                                     ABBOTT
                         I'll say. You killed his goddam 
                         girlfriend instead. Now they're onto  
                         Neski. They're at the Brecker Hotel 
                         even as we speak.

                                     GRETKOV
                         Will it track back to us?

                                     ABBOTT
                         No. The files are spotless. Whatever 
                         they find, it's just going to make 
                         Conklin look worse.

                                     GRETKOV
                         And the Landy woman?

                                     ABBOTT
                         She's done everything I wanted. She 
                         bit on Conklin so fast it was 
                         laughable. She even found his bogus 
                         Swiss account...

                                     GRETKOV
                         Anything else?

               ABBOTT shoves a piece of paper -- and ADDRESS -- into 
               GRETKOV'S hand.

                                     ABBOTT
                              (the paper)
                         There's a body in the basement. Danny 
                         Zorn. He's got to disappear. For 
                         good. Clean and fast. I'll put him 
                         in bed with Conklin and Bourne. Even 
                         the girl, Nicky. Give me twenty-four 
                         hours, I'll think it up. But get the 
                         goddamn body out of there.

               It's getting late. A taxi now and then...

                                     ABBOTT
                         Neski was a roadblock. Without me, 
                         there's no company, no fortune. You 
                         owe me, Uri. One last push.

                                     GRETKOV
                         One last push. One.

               GRETKOV leaves. ABBOTT watches him go.

               EXT. MERCEDES -- NIGHT

               Seconds later. GRETKOV getting in slowly.

               INT. MERCEDES -- NIGHT

               KIRILL slouched in back. Waiting. Gretkov to the DRIVER.

                                     GRETKOV
                         [Airport.]

                         [We're done here.]

               KIRILL nods. As they pull away, ABBOTT turns and walks into 
               the foggy night...

               EXT. BERLIN STREET -- NIGHT A248

               Late. ABBOTT walks. A lonely figure. Past someone in the 
               shadows --

                                     BOURNE
                         Mr. Abbott?

               He turns to answer when BOURNE firmly guides him into a side 
               street...

                         Here's what I've got.
                              (reads)
                         Remember Vladimir Neski? Russian 
                         politician? Seven years ago, he was 
                         due to speak to a group of European 
                         Oil ministers here at the hotel. He 
                         never did. He was murdered.

                         His wife. In room 645. Then she shot

                         Alright... I want you, Kurt and Kim 
                         to stay on Bourne, track everything 
                         that's out there...

               TEDDY goes to get in the van. PAMELA follows with CRONIN.

                                     PAMELA
                              (confidentially to 
                              Cronin)
                         And I want you to go through and 
                         cross reference our buy that went 
                         bad, the Neskis, and Treadstone --

               As they get in...

                                     PAMELA
                         -- they have to be related.

               EXT. BERLIN TRAIN STATION -- NIGHT

               BOURNE'S ARRIVED. Limping. As he continues for the station --

               INT. BERLIN TRAIN STATION LOCKER AREA -- NIGHT

               BOURNE retrieving the exfil bag he stashed in the locker. 
               Changed his clothes.

               INT. BERLIN TRAIN STATION MEN'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               Bag slung -- limping out -- BOURNE has changed clothes. A 
               big overcoat, knit cap.

               INT. BERLIN TRAIN STATION PLATFORM -- NIGHT

               A busy midnight departure. Big train. BOURNE climbing on the 
               train, under the sign:

                                      MOSCOW EXPRESS

               MOVED

               INT. NEW BERLIN HQ/COMMAND POST -- NIGHT

               A BLUEPRINT spread across a table. NICKY, KURT & KIM all 
               gathered around. CRONIN works the TREADSTONE files on another 
               table. TEDDY at center briefing PAMELA.

                                     TEDDY
                         We're looking at all Berlin outbound. 
                         Good news is, every train station in 
                         Berlin has thirty to forty fixed, 
                         digital security cameras. Common 
                         feed.

                                     PAMELA
                         Are we hacking or asking?

                                     TEDDY
                         Yes. In that order.

                                     PAMELA
                         And what about you, anything?

                                     CRONIN
                         It's starting to link up -- the 
                         hijacked money -- the leak -- Pecos 
                         Oil -- one last bit is Treadstone.

               EXT. MOSCOW TRAIN -- NIGHT

               Crossing the border into Poland -- Cold, desolate, snow --

               INT. MOSCOW TRAIN/PASSENGER CAR -- NIGHT

               CONDUCTORS moving quietly through the dark cars. Checking 
               tickets and visas and --

               BOURNE -- hands over his ticket and RUSSIAN PASSPORT -- off 
               the grid --

               DELETED

               INT. NEW BERLIN HQ/COMMAND POST -- NIGHT

               4:00 am. KURT, KIM, and TEDDY spread around the room. They've 
               been running laptop train station videos for hours. Just 
               about ready to raise the white flag.

               All they have so far is an isolated loop of BOURNE limping 
               into the men's room. Cronin watches it stutter along.

                                     CRONIN
                         Does it look like he's faking?

                                     TEDDY
                         On the way in? Forget it.

                                     KURT
                         The leg's definitely hurt.

                                     CRONIN
                              (the blueprint)
                         Well, there's no window in the men's 
                         room, folks, so let's find somebody 
                         coming out with a bad left leg.

                                     KURT
                              (worn out)
                         Maybe he's still in there.

                                     TEDDY
                         I've got a limping guy, but it's the 
                         right leg.

                                     KIM
                         Walking away, or walking toward you?

               CRONIN jumping on that, right there, over TEDDY'S shoulder --

                                     CRONIN
                         That's him. It's the coat! What train 
                         is that?

               INT. MOSCOW TRAIN/PASSENGER CAR -- DAWN

               BOURNE -- asleep in his chair -- rocked by the rhythm. But 
               something wakes him up.

               Looks out the window -- something weird about the light out 
               there -- then up to see:

               MARIE -- looking at him over the back of his chair in front 
               of him -- no big deal --

                                     BOURNE
                         Hey...

               She smiles. A beat. She comes around, sits beside him. He 
               looks away out the window.

                                     BOURNE
                         I wanted to kill him.

                                     MARIE
                         But you found another choice.

                                     BOURNE
                         I did.

                                     MARIE
                         It wouldn't have changed the way you 
                         feel.

                                     BOURNE
                         It might have.

               BOURNE looks back at her. She smiles. He accepts it, leans 
               back, closes his eyes. 

                                     BOURNE
                         I know it's a dream.

                                     MARIE
                         You do?

                                     BOURNE
                         I only dream about people who are 
                         dead.

               MARIE leans over, kisses his forehead. Whispers --

                                     BOURNE
                         God, I miss you. I don't know what 
                         to do without you.

                                     MARIE
                              (softly, serenely)
                         Jason. You know exactly what to do. 
                         That is your mission now.

               BOURNE opens his eyes.

               And it's morning outside.

               And Marie is gone.

               A LITTLE GIRL smiles at him from over the back of the chair 
               in front. BOURNE can't meet her gaze for long. As he looks 
               back out the window --

               DELETED

               INT. MOSCOW TRAIN/PASSENGER CAR -- DAWN

               BOURNE watching the birch trees rush past, not quite hiding 
               the smokestacks beyond. Eyes locked. Forging something within, 
               one final mission, as we --

               INT. BERLIN WESTIN HOTEL LOBBY -- EARLY MORNING

               ABBOTT coming through. It's empty this early, but --

               Here's PAMELA, NICKY, CRONIN and the TEAM waiting to report.

                                     PAMELA
                         Sorry to wake you.

                                     ABBOTT
                              (waves off apology)
                         I wasn't sleeping.
                              (to Nicky as he passes)
                         You OK?

                                     NICKY
                         Yeah, thanks.

                                     ABBOTT
                         What's up?

                                     PAMELA
                         Bunch of stuff.

               PAMELA looks to CRONIN -- him first.

                                     CRONIN
                         We tied the room Bourne visited 
                         tonight to a murder/suicide seven 
                         years ago. A Russian couple, the 
                         Neskis.

                                     ABBOTT
                              (playing along)
                         Neski. The reformer. I remember that.

                                     CRONIN
                         He championed the equal distribution 
                         of oil leases in the Caspian Sea. 
                         When he died, they were all released 
                         to one petroleum company, Pecos Oil. 
                         Guess what? -- the CEO, Uri Gretkov, 
                         is ex-KGB.

                                     NICKY
                         Someone was using Treadstone as a 
                         private cleaning service.

                                     ABBOTT
                         Conklin...
                              (a beat)
                         It's -- I'm sorry, Pamela. I guess 
                         you were right all along.

               Pamela waves him off, it's okay, but --

                                     PAMELA
                         There's something else.

               Abbott can see by their faces: this hits closer to home.

                                     ABBOTT
                         What?

                                     PAMELA
                         They found Danny Zorn's body. Dead 
                         in the basement at the building where 
                         my people got hit the first time.

                                     ABBOTT
                         Oh, God... It must have been Bourne.

                                     PAMELA
                         Did he say anything to you?

                                     ABBOTT
                         No... It must have been Bourne.

               PAMELA, straight...

                                     PAMELA
                         We'll know for sure when we get the 
                         security tapes.

                                     CRONIN
                         But we can relax. We tracked him. 
                         He's on a train to Moscow.

               ABBOTT reeling, hiding it.

                                     ABBOTT
                         Moscow? What the Hell's he going to 
                         Moscow for?

                                     PAMELA
                              (shrugs)
                         Don't know.

                                     ABBOTT
                         Jesus... I, Zorn... I have to call 
                         his family. Tell them...

                                     PAMELA
                         I'm sorry, Ward.

               They watch as he goes.

                              (matter of fact)
                         This is not a clean phone.

               INT. WESTIN GRAND HOTEL LOBBY -- DAWN

               Everyone still here. CRONIN answering his cell phone -- 
               motioning to them, he's got news --

                                     CRONIN
                              (phone to his ear)
                         You're sure?

                                     PAMELA
                         What? The tapes?

                                     CRONIN
                              (nodding but)
                         Hold on...
                              (holding the phone)
                         Yep. And Abbott just direct dialed 
                         Moscow from his room...

               Now we realize, she's set a trap and Abbott's walked in. All 
               the same, Pamela shakes her head, wishes it wasn't true.

               And they're moving --

               INT. ABBOTT'S WESTIN HOTEL ROOM -- DAWN

               ABBOTT at his desk, still on the phone, pouring a vodka.

                                     GRETKOV
                         Leaving was a business decision. 
                         We're both rich, come enjoy it.

                                     ABBOTT
                         What do you mean?

                                     GRETKOV
                         Go to the airport. Get a plane. I'll 
                         have a brass band waiting for you.

                                     ABBOTT
                         Save it for Bourne.

                                     GRETKOV
                         What?

               There's a KNOCKING AT HIS DOOR -- ABBOTT simply ignores it.

                                     ABBOTT
                         He left yesterday on the night train. 
                         He's probably just getting in now.
                              (he drinks)
                         You'll have to hurry.

                                     GRETKOV
                         Bourne comes here? Why?

               More KNOCKING...

                                     ABBOTT
                         Good luck.

               EXT. MOSCOW TRAIN -- DAWN

               Speeding East through the Russian countryside. The forest is 
               gone, replaced by factories and refineries. A wasteland of 
               rust and gray that seems to go on forever --

               INT. WESTIN HALLWAY OUTSIDE ABBOTT'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               PAMELA knocking again. NICKY, TEDDY and CRONIN behind her.

                         Open it.

               CRONIN with a pass key. TEDDY prepped and --

               PAMELA leading -- they enter -- stop short --

               ABBOTT at his desk, calmly pointing a PISTOL -- at Pamela.

                                     ABBOTT
                         They go. You stay.

               She looks back. CRONIN shakes his head 'no'.

                                     PAMELA
                         Yes. Now...

               They reluctantly obey. The door clicking shut behind them.

                                     ABBOTT
                         Sit down.

                                     PAMELA
                         I'd rather stand if it's all the 
                         same to you.

                                     ABBOTT
                         I don't exactly know what to say -- 
                         I'm sorry.

                                     PAMELA
                         'Why' would be enough for me.

                                     ABBOTT
                         I'm not a traitor. I've served my 
                         ountry.

                                     PAMELA
                         And pocketed a fair amount of change 
                         while doing it.

                                     ABBOTT
                         Why not? It was just money.

                                     PAMELA
                         And Danny Zorn, what was that?

                                     ABBOTT
                         Had to be done.

                                     PAMELA
                         No good options left?

                                     ABBOTT
                              (shrugs)
                         In the end, honestly, it's hubris. 
                         Simple hubris. You reach a point in 
                         this game when the only satisfaction 
                         left is to see how clever you are.

                                     PAMELA
                         No. You lost your way.

                                     ABBOTT
                         Well, you're probably right. I guess 
                         that's all that hubris is.

               He raises the gun. PAMELA -- presses her lips together, closes 
               her eyes.

               BOOM!

               She opens them. And as CRONIN flies back through the door --

               There's ABBOTT -- dead at the desk -- he's shot himself -- 
               also, in a way, with some help from Bourne.

               BOURNE on the move. Welcome to the whole mad Moscow scene. A

               departures. Families. Beggars. Drunk war vets. Hawkers.

               EXT. MOSCOW TRAIN STATION CAB STAND -- DAY

               There, in the plaza. BOURNE hobbling across the street, when 
               suddenly -- A CAR HORN! -- he turns and --

               BIG BLACK BMW speeding past -- followed by TWO MORE -- all

               BOURNE turns. A grizzled TAXI DRIVER right beside him.

               BOURNE pulls a slip of paper from his pocket.

               THE TAXI DRIVER squints, finally grunts affirmative.

               MOSCOW COPS fanning through the crowd showing BOURNE'S

               AN ABANDONED WOODEN HOUSE. Windows shattered and boarded up.

               EXT. MARKET PARKING LOT -- DAY

               Another CAB STAND. CABBIE by a YELLOW CAB, looks up to see --

               BOURNE -- coming toward him -- and also --

               The TWO COPS. As BOURNE nears, the CABBIE shakes his head.

               Bourne pivots -- casually -- like he doesn't know they're 
               coming until -- HE SPITS! -- VODKA -- into one of the cop's 
               face! -- blinded as BOURNE takes him and his PARTNER out.

               THE TWO MOSCOW POLICE CARS splitting up! -- one on Bourne's 
               ass -- the other cutting hard into A SIDE STREET, flanking

               BOURNE -- topping the hill -- two choices -- right or left?

               RIGHT! -- No! -- wrong -- because down the hill there's A 
               POLICE CAR just about to angle in from THE SIDE-STREET and --

               BOURNE -- no choice -- FLOORING IT! --

               Huge, awful Soviet-era housing towers fill the horizon.

               A CITY BUS grinds to a stop. PEOPLE trundle off. Working 
               people at the end of their day. Tired. Cold.

               THE CAMERA FOLLOWS

               A GIRL. Trudging a man-made wasteland. Twenty. A proud little 
               waif. Sad eyes. Home from some job. IRENA.

               EXT./INT. PROJECT BUILDING ENTRANCE -- EVENING

               Grimmer up close. Rusted steel mesh over the windows. DRUNK 
               TEENAGERS. A haze of cigarette smoke.

               IRENA pushing through. Doesn't want to talk to anyone --

               It's dark. And she's barely through the door when --

                              (his shabby Russian)
                         [Quiet. Silence. Okay?]

               IRENA nods. Scared. Gun in hand, BOURNE pushes the door the 
               last few inches so it's fully closed.

                                     IRENA
                         [I have no money. No drugs. Is that 
                         what you want?]

               And now she can really see him. He's a disaster. Shivering. 
               Bloody. Eyes more hollow than hers are.

                                     BOURNE
                         Sit. Can you...
                              (trying to conjure

                         I speak English.

               BOURNE staring at her. Nods. Gestures for her to sit.

                         Please...

               So she does. And here they are.

                                     BOURNE
                         Of all the people in the world, you're 
                         the only one I have anything to offer.
                              (hesitating)
                         That's why I came here.

                                     IRENA
                              (she's terrified)
                         Okay.

               He's got something beside him. Something he's taken off the 
               wall. IT'S THE PHOTOGRAPH. The Neski family. Same as the one 
               that was in the Hotel Brecker. Mom, Dad and Irena, arms around 
               each other, in front of the house. Before it was abandoned. 
               Happy. Smiling. Perfect.

                                     BOURNE
                         It's nice.
                              (a beat)
                         Does this picture mean anything to 
                         you?
                              (no answer)
                         Hmm?

                                     IRENA
                         It's nothing. It's just a picture.

                                     BOURNE
                         No. It's because you don't know how 
                         they died.

                                     IRENA
                              (he couldn't understand)
                         No, I do.

               A change in BOURNE as he studies her, measures her. Some 
               moment of truth is here. IRENA braces, unsure.

                                     BOURNE
                         I would want to know.
                              (beat)
                         I would want to know that my mother 
                         didn't kill my father. I would want 
                         to know that she didn't kill herself.

                                     IRENA
                         What?

               She really looks at him now. Fear overwhelmed by curiosity.

                                     BOURNE
                         I would grow up thinking that they 
                         didn't love me if they just left me 
                         like that.

               Irena making sure her eyes don't leave his. They don't.

                                     BOURNE
                         It changes things. That knowledge. 
                         Doesn't it?

                              (wary)
                         Yes...

                                     BOURNE
                         That's not what happened to your 
                         parents.

                                     IRENA
                         Then what?

                                     BOURNE
                         I killed them.

               Body blows, but he has her attention. She wipes a tear.

                                     BOURNE
                         It was my job. My first time. Your 
                         father was supposed to be alone. But 
                         then your mother, she came out of 
                         nowhere...
                              (a little shrug)
                         I had to change my plan.

                         You understand me?
                              (does she?)
                         You don't have to live like that 
                         anymore. Thinking that.

                                     IRENA
                         You killed them.

               BOURNE nods, that's right.

                                     BOURNE
                         They loved you.
                              (beat)
                         And I killed them.

                                     IRENA
                         How... how can... how can you be 
                         here and say this?

                                     BOURNE
                         I don't want you to forgive me.

               She stands suddenly. Stands because if she doesn't she'll 
               burst into tears. Because she knows if she starts crying she 
               won't be able to make sense of this.

                                     IRENA
                         For who?
                              (he doesn't answer)
                         KILLED FOR WHO?

               BOURNE pushes himself to his feet. A real effort.

                                     BOURNE
                         It doesn't matter. Your life is hard 
                         enough.

                                     IRENA
                         You're a liar.

                                     BOURNE
                         You know I'm not.

                                     IRENA
                         YOU'RE A LIAR!

                                     BOURNE
                         Look at me.

               There they are. Two people standing in a room. Squared off.

               And now she starts crying. Really crying.

               And he's taking it.

                                     IRENA
                         I should kill you... if it's true 
                         you should die... I should kill you 
                         now!

                                     BOURNE
                         I can't let you do that either.

                                     IRENA
                         Because you're afraid!

                                     BOURNE
                         No.
                              (starting for the 
                              door)
                         Because you don't want to know how 
                         it feels.

               She hesitates. Stunned. He's leaving. He's opening the door.

                                     BOURNE
                         I have to go now.

                                     IRENA
                         Is this really happening?

                                     BOURNE
                              (empty)
                         I'm sorry.

               And she sags. Back into the chair, as --

               THE CAMERA FINDS

               THE PHOTOGRAPH on the table. The sound of the door closing 
               and Irena crying, as --

               EXT. HOUSING PROJECT PLAYGROUND -- DAY

               BOURNE trudging along. Across the snow. He's done it.

               And he really can't take another step. There's a bench. He 
               sits down. Out of gas.

               He just might die here. We slowly tilt up to the multi colored 
               Moscow tenements.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- DAY

               BOURNE waking up -- sitting up -- where is he? -- trying to 
               get his bearings -- but it's so bright -- white walls -- 
               sheets -- SUNSHINE through clean windows and --

                                     PAMELA (O.S.)
                         Hello, David.

               There she is. Standing at the foot of his bed.

                                     BOURNE
                         Where am I?

                                     PAMELA
                         Ramstein Air Base, Germany.
                              (smiles)
                         Before the wall fell you would have 
                         woken up in a Russian prison hospital.

               He looks around -- tries to move -- hammered by pain.

                                     BOURNE
                         Oh, shit...

                                     PAMELA
                         Careful...

               Long moment. He's taking it in. Trying to.

                                     BOURNE
                         Why am I alive?

                                     PAMELA
                         Are you disappointed?

               They study each other a beat.

                                     BOURNE
                         I know who you are.

               PAMELA nods. Very calm here. No sudden movements.

                                     PAMELA
                         Thank you for your gift. I'm sorry 
                         about Marie.

                                     BOURNE
                         What's that?

                                     PAMELA
                         Do you think you can read? Are you 
                         well enough?

               She has a folder. A PHOTOGRAPH -- Bourne's face -- stapled 
               to the cover.

                                     PAMELA
                         It's all in here. Treadstone. A 
                         summary of your life. All of it.

               He waves it off.

                                     BOURNE
                         Don't need it. I remember everything.

                                     PAMELA
                              (smiles again)
                         Sounds like a threat.

                                     BOURNE
                         You didn't answer my question.

                                     PAMELA
                         Why you're alive?
                              (beat)
                         You're alive because you're special. 
                         Because she kept you alive.
                              (she smiles)
                         Because we want you back on our side.

               BOURNE silent. But hearing it. PAMELA leaves the file.

                                     PAMELA
                         Take a look at it. We'll talk later.

               BOURNE watching her back away. As she exits into --

               INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR -- DAY

               Long, sterile hallway. CRONIN and NICKY standing there with 
               an AIR FORCE SENTRY assigned to guard the room.

               CRONIN and NICKY trying to play it cool, but now, as they 
               get some distance down the hallway --

                                     PAMELA
                              (to the sentry)
                         Let's give him half an hour.

                                     NICKY
                              (quietly)
                         So?

                                     PAMELA
                         Felt promising. It's a start.

               A chill in the air. Both of them going quiet because there's 
               A NURSE carrying a tray of food. She's coming toward us. 
               They're walking away.

               THE CAMERA

               Staying with THE NURSE now. Coming up the hall.

               THE SENTRY smiles -- opens the door and she enters --

               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- DAY

               Empty bed. Open window. Bourne is gone. As THE MUSIC STARTS 
               PUMPING, and we...

               EXT. MUSEUM ISLAND BRIDGE -- BERLIN -- DAY

               Off he goes. Disappearing into thin air...

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                                         THE END
