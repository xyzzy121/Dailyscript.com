                    -- 3RD DRAFT --


                    SCREENPLAY BY ALEX COX & TOD DAVIES

                    BASED ON THE BOOK BY HUNTER S. THOMPSON





















     BLACK SCREEN


     Roll Credits.

     Title:             "HE WHO MAKES A BEAST OF
                         HIMSELF GETS RID OF THE
                         PAIN OF BEING A MAN."

                                  -- DR. JOHNSON

     The VOICE OF RAOUL DUKE is heard.

                             DUKE VOICEOVER
                        We were somewhere around Barstow
                        on the edge of the desert when the
                        drugs began to take hold.

     WHOOSH.  The BLACK SCREEN gets wiped away by the WHITE
     DESERT and the RED CHEVY CONVERTIBLE that races down the
     highway at a hundred miles an hour....

     Leaving behind it nothing but the DESERT.


     <u>ON THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS</u>     EXT     DAY

     Following the RED CONVERTIBLE.
     The convertible, top down, plows forward manically like a
     RED SHARK slicing through bloody water.

     AT THE WHEEL

     RAOUL DUKE, a.k.a. HUNTER S. THOMPSON, skeletal, bald,
     sunglassed, beer in hand.

     Beside him, turning the music up, up, UP, DR. GONZO (real
     name withheld)--swarthy, stocky, firebreathing bull.  He
     wears ONE BLACK GLOVE.

                              DUKE V/O
                        I remember saying something like:
                        "I feel a bit lightheaded.  Maybe
                        you should drive..."

     But in the car, nothing is said.  DUKE stares straight
     ahead.

     Oblivious to the bloody NICKS this procedure has left
     behind.

                             DUKE V/O
                        Suddenly there was a terrible roar
                        all around us and the sky was full of
                        what looked like huge bats, all swooping
                        and screeching and diving around the car.
                        And my voice screaming:  "Holy Jesus!
                        What are these goddamn animals?"

     DUKE continues to look steadily ahead.
     DR. GONZO looks lazily at him.

                             DR. GONZO
                        Did you say something?

     DUKE shakes his head, pulls over with a screech to the side
     of the road.

                             DUKE V/O
                        No point mentioning those bats, I
                        thought.  The poor bastard will see
                        them soon enough.

     He gets out of the car, goes to the trunk, OPENS it.

     IN THE TRUNK -- a heavy drug and drink inventory.
     Like a mobile police narcotics lab.

     DUKE surveys the cache.

                             DUKE V/O
                        We had two bags of grass, seventy-five
                        pellets of mescaline, five sheets of hight
                        powered blotter acid, a salt shaker half
                        full of cocaine, a whole galaxy of multi-
                        colored uppers, downers, screamers,
                        laughers....Also a quart of tequila, a
                        quart of rum, a case of Budweiser, a pint
                        of raw ether and two dozen amyls.

     He scrambles a new selection into a kit bag, grabs another
     six-pack of beer, and slams the trunk shut.

                             DUKE V/O
                        Not that we <u>needed</u> all that for the
                        trip, but once you get locked into a
                        serious drug collection, the tendency
                        is to push it as far as you can.

     DUKE gets into the car and takes off down the road.

     AS THE RED SHARK DISAPPEARS INTO THE DISTANCE --

                             DUKE V/O
                        The only thing that really worried me
                        was the ether.  There is nothing in the
                        world more helpless and irresponsible
                        and depraved than a man in the depths
                        of an ether binge.  And I knew we'd get
                        into that rotten stuff pretty soon.
                        Probably at the next gas station.

     IN THE RED SHARK

     DUKE continues his straightahead drive.
     The RADIO NEWS wars with MUSIC from a TAPE RECORDER in the
     front seat.

                             RADIO NEWS
                        A House Subcommittee report says illegal
                        drugs killed 160 American GI's last year-

                        40 of them in Vietnam...Drugs were
                        suspected, it said, in another 56
                        military deaths in Asia..."Drug
                        suppression in Vietnam is almost
                        completely ineffective," the report
                        said, "partially because some
                        presently unknown corrupt officials
                        in public office are involved..."

     DR. GONZO turns the MUSIC up, drowning out the news.
     He washes a couple of pills back with a new beer.

                             DR. GONZO
                        Man, this is the way to travel.

                             DUKE
                        Wait till you see those goddamn bats.

     UP AHEAD - AT THE SIDE OF THE DESERTED ROAD

     A LONE HITCHHIKER spots them, jumps up and down to get their
     attention.

                             DR. GONZO
                        Let's give this boy a lift.

                             DUKE
                        We can't stop here!  This is <u>bat</u>
                        <u>country</u>!

     DR. GONZO grabs the steering wheel.  The car swerves to
     the shoulder.

                             DR. GONZO
                        As your attorney, I advise you
                        to act normal.

     THE RED SHARK SCREECHES TO A GRAVEL SPEWING HALT.
     The HITCHHIKER, delighted by his luck, races to the car.
     A poor Okie kid with a big grin.

                             HITCHHIKER
                        Hot damn!  I never rode in
                        a convertible before!

     And he STOPS DEAD.  DUKE and DR. GONZO look out at him with
     HYPER NORMAL FIXED SMILES.

                             DUKE
                        Is that right?  Well, I guess
                        you're about ready, eh?

     Somewhat reassured, the HITCHHIKER scrambles into the back
     seat.  DR. GONZO turns with a strange expression.

                             DR. GONZO
                        We're your friends.  We're not like
                        the others.

                             DUKE
                          (sharply)
                        No more of that talk, or I'll put
                        the leeches on you.

                             DR. GONZO
                        Did you know that this same lonely
                        desert was the last known home of
                        the Manson family?

     The HITCHHIKER considers getting out.  Too late.  The RED
     SHARK roars off down the road.


     <u>DOWN THE ROAD</u>

     The HITCHHIKER sweats bullets.  DR. GONZO sings along to the
     tape player.  DUKE, also sweating bullets, keeps staring at
     the HITCHHIKER in the rearview mirror.

     The HITCHHIKER meets his gaze with a weak smile.

                             DR. GONZO
                          (reassuringly)
                        It's okay.  He's admiring the
                        shape of your skull.

                             DUKE
                          (roaring over the road noise)
                        THERE'S ONE THING YOU SHOULD PROBABLY
                        UNDERSTAND --

     The HITCHHIKER stares at him, not blinking, gritting his
     teeth.

                             DUKE
                          (yells)
                        CAN YOU HEAR ME?

     The HITCHHIKER nods.

     DUKE keeps turning around to talk.  Dangerous at that speed.

                             DUKE
                        That's good.  Because I want you
                        to know that we're on our way to
                        Las Vegas to find the American Dream.
                        That's why we rented this car.  Can you
                        grasp that?
                          (HITCHHIKER nods again)
                        I want you to have all the background.
                          (to DR. GONZO)
                        Here, you drive.

     Still babbling intently at the mesmerized HITCHHIKER, DUKE
     trades his foot for DR. GONZO's on the accelerator, and
     climbs over him.  DR. GONZO slides into the driver's seat.
     DUKE can now focus on the HITCHHIKER.

                             DUKE
                        This is a very ominous assignment--
                        with overtones of extreme personal
                        danger.

     The HITCHHIKER stares at him, terrified.

                             DUKE
                        Now, I don't want you to be afraid.
                        I'm a Doctor of Journalism, goddamnit!
                          (WHACKS the BACK OF THE DRIVER'S SEAT
                          with his fist)
                        This is <u>important</u>, goddamnit!  This
                        is a <u>true</u> story!

     The CAR swerves sickeningly, then straightens out.

                             DR. GONZO
                          (screams)
                        Keep your hands off my fucking neck!

     The HITCHHIKER looks as if he's decided to take his chances
     jumping.  But DUKE grabs him and drags him back down.

                             DUKE
                        I want you to understand that this
                        man at the wheel is my <u>attorney</u>!  He's
                        not just some dingbat I found on the
                        Strip.  Shit, <u>look</u> at him!  He doesn't
                        look like you or me, right?  That's
                        because he's a foreigner.  I think he's
                        probably Samoan.  But it doesn't matter,
                        does it?  Are you prejudiced?

                             HITCHHIKER
                        Hell, no!

                             DUKE
                        I didn't think so.  Because in spite
                        of his race, this man is extremely
                        valuable to me --

     He waves his hand, meaning to slap DR. GONZO on the thigh,
     but hits a SIX PACK instead.

                             DUKE
                        Hell, I forgot all about this beer.
                        You want one?
                          (HITCHHIKER shakes his head)
                        How about some ether?

                             HITCHHIKER
                        What?

                             DUKE
                        Never mind.  Let's get right to the
                        heart of this thing.  You see, about
                        twenty-four hours ago we were sitting
                        in the Polo Lounge of the Beverly Hills
                        Hotel --


     <u>THE BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL, 1971</u>     EXT     DAY

     A calm, beautiful, pastel Los Angeles day.
     PALM TREES wave dreamily.

                             DUKE V/O
                        -- in the patio section, of course.
                        Under a palm tree.


     <u>THE BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL POLO LOUNGE</u>     INT     DAY

     A uniformed DWARF, carrying a PHONE ON A TRAY, makes his way
     through the glitteringly well-heeled POLO LOUNGE CROWD.
     ACTRESSES with long straight hair and hot pants.  Affluent
     ROCK PROMOTERS with long fluffy hair and beads.

     A PIANIST plays a mild version of "PUFF. THE MAGIC DRAGON."

                             DUKE V/O
                        ...hiding from the brutish realities
                        of this foul year of Our Lord, 1971.

     ON THE PATIO can be seen DUKE and DR. GONZO,
     the latter clad in white rayon bell bottoms and a khaki
     undershirt, the former in a frayed Acapulco shirt, levis,
     dirty white sneakers, and shades.  The table is littered
     with glasses and overflowing ashtrays.

     Both of them are so drunk, they can hardly speak.

     A uniformed DWARF approaches, bearing a pink TELEPHONE on a
     silver tray

                             DWARF
                        This must be the call you've been
                        waiting for all this time, sir.

     DUKE takes the PHONE, listens.  He hangs up.  Turns to face
     DR. GONZO.

                             DUKE
                        That was headquarters.  They want me to
                        go to Las Vegas at once and make contact
                        with a Portuguese photographer named
                        Lacerda.  He'll have the details.

                             DR. GONZO
                        What kind of story is this?

                             DUKE
                        The Mint 400. It's the richest off-
                        the-road race for motorcycles in the
                        history of organised sport--a fantastic
                        spectacle in honor of some fatback
                        <u>grossero</u< named Del Webb who owns
                        the luxurious Mint Hotel in the heart
                        of downtown Las Vegas.  All I have to do
                        is check into my soundproof suite...

                             DR. GONZO
                        Suite?

     DUKE nods.

                             DR. GONZO
                        God <u>hell</u>!  I think I see the <u>pattern</u>!

     DR. GONZO stands up, turns around twice in his excitement,
     tucks his undershirt into his pants, and POUNDS the table so
     hard that glasses fly everywhere.

                             DR. GONZO
                        This one sounds like real trouble!
                        You're going to need plenty of legal
                        advice before this thing is over.  And
                        my first advice is that you should rent
                        a very fast car with no top and get the
                        hell out of L.A. for at least forty-eight
                        hours.

     DUKE rises.  They head for the lobby.

                             DR. GONZO
                        This blows my weekend, because naturally
                        I'll have to go with you--and we'll have
                        to arm ourselves.

                             DUKE
                          (nods thoughtfully)
                        Why not?  If a thing like this is worth
                        doing at all.  it's worth doing right.
                        This is the American Dream in action!
                        We'd be fools not to ride this strange
                        torpedo all the way out to the end.

                             DR. GONZO
                        Indeed.  We <u>must</u> do it.

     They march out.


     <u>THE BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL</u>     EXT     DAY

     DUKE and DR. GONZO hurry out the door.

                             DUKE
                        The first thing we need is drugs, and
                        a super-sensitive tape recorder.
                        And some Acapulco shirts.

                             DR. GONZO
                        As your attorney I advise you to buy a
                        motorcycle.  How else can you cover a
                        thing like this righteously?

                             DUKE
                        We gotta get hold of a Vincent Black
                        Shadow.

                             DR. GONZO
                        What's that?

                             DUKE
                        Fantastic bike.  Two thousand cubic
                        inches.  200 brake-horsepower at 4,000
                        r.p.m. on a magnesium frame, with
                        styrofoam seats and a total curb weight
                        of 200 lbs.

     The CAR VALET drives up DUKE's old PINTO - brown paint job,
     rusted-out, smashed door panels.  The exact opposite of the
     VINCENT BLACK SHADOW.

                             DR. GONZO
                        You better call New York for some cash.

     They get in and take off, muffler dragging on the ground.


     <u>POLYNESIAN BAR</u>     EXT     DAY

     The PINTO parked haphazardly outside, a BUNCH OF BRIGHTLY
     COLORED SHIRTS hanging in the rear window.  An ORGY OF
     CONSUMPTION has been unleashed.

                             DUKE V/O
                        Getting hold of the drugs and shirts
                        had been no problem, but the car and
                        tape recorder were not easy things to
                        round up at 6:30 on a Friday afternoon
                        in Hollywood.


     <u>POLYNESIAN BAR</u>     INT     DAY

     DR. GONZO yells into a PAYPHONE in a darkly lit corner.

     DUKE carries over four Singapore Slings.  He tosses the
     ornamental parasols into the pot of a plastic rubber plant.
     They join many other parasols there.

                             DR. GONZO
                          (hand over the PHONE)
                        Seventeen calls, but I finally
                        located a car with adequate horsepower
                        and the proper coloring.
                          (into PHONE)
                        Hang onto it.  We'll be there in
                        thirty minutes.
                          (shouts)
                        What?  OF COURSE the gentleman has
                        a major credit card!  Do you realize
                        who the fuck you're talking to?

                             DUKE
                          (hands him a drink)
                        Don't take any guff from these swine.
                          (GONZO slams the PHONE down)
                        Now we need a sound store with the
                        finest equipment.  Nothing dinky.  One of
                        those new Belgian Heliowatts
                        with a voice-activated shotgun mike,
                        for picking up conversations in
                        oncoming cars.

     GONZO nods curtly and goes back to working the phone.


     <u>POLYNESIAN BAR</u>     EXT     DAY

     DUKE and DR. GONZO emerge from the bar, carrying drinks.
     They drive away

                             DUKE V/O
                        We made several more calls and finally
                        located our equipment in a store about
                        five miles away.  It was closed, but the
                        salesman said he would wait, if we
                        hurried...


     <u>SUNSET BOULEVARD</u>     EXT     DAY

     TRAFFIC JAM.  The PINTO caught in it.  DUKE honks the horn
     as an AMBULANCE lumbers past.

                             DUKE V/O
                        But we were delayed en route
                        when a Stingray in front of us
                        killed a pedestrian.

     DUKE leans on the horn.


     <u>SOUND STORE</u>     EXT     DUSK

     A "CLOSED" sign up.  DUKE pounds on the door.  DR. GONZO's
     face is pressed to the window glass.

                             DUKE V/O
                        The store was closed by the time we
                        got there.  There were people inside.
                        but they refused to come to the double-
                        glass door until we gave it a few belts
                        and made ourselves clear.

     Things turn ugly.  TWO SALESMEN holding TIRE IRONS come to
     the door.  A negotiation goes on through the mail slot.

                             DUKE V/O
                        Finally, we managed to negotiate a sale.

     The SALESMEN open the door just wide enough to shove the
     SQUND EQUIPMENT out, and write down the credit card number
     as DUKE holds the card against the glass.

                             SALESMAN
                          (through the slot)
                        Now take that stuff and get the
                        hell away from here!

                             DR. GONZO
                          (shaking his fist)
                        We'll be back.  One of these days I'll
                        toss a fucking bomb into this place!
                        I have your name on this sales slip!
                        I'll find out where you live and burn
                        your house down!
                          (mutters)
                        That'll give him something to think
                        about.

     DUKE tosses the equipment in the PINTO, and they drive away.

                             DUKE V/O
                        We had trouble, again, at the car
                        rental agency.











               [PAGE 12 MISSING FROM THE SCREENPLAY]











     <u>RUNDOWN BEACH HOUSE</u>     EXT     NIGHT

     DUKE and GONZO ferry drugs into the RED SHARK.

                             DUKE V/O
                        We spent the rest of that night
                        rounding up materials and packing
                        the car.

     They disappear.  The RED SHARK glitters in the moonlight.
     In the distance, the SOUND of someone SHOUTING as they JUMP
     INTO THE SURF.

                             DUKE V/O
                        Then we ate some mescaline and went
                        swimming in the ocean.  Somewhere around
                        dawn we had breakfast in a Malibu coffee
                        shop --


     <u>PASADENA FREEWAY</u>     EXT     DAY

     The RED SHARK drives east.

                             DUKE V/O
                        -- then drove very carefully across
                        town and plunged onto the smog-shrouded
                        Pasadena Freeway, heading East.


     <u>DESERT ROAD</u>     EXT     DAY

     The HITCHHIKER stares, glassy-eyed, at DUKE.

                             DUKE
                        Do you understand?
                          (HITCHHIKER nods)
                        I know what you're thinking.  You're
                        thinking:  "Old elephants limp off to
                        the hills to die: old Americans go out
                        to the highway and drive themselves to
                        death with huge cars."

                             HITCHHIKER
                        No, no --

                             DUKE
                          (earnestly)
                        But our trip is different.  It is a
                        classic affirmation of everything right
                        and true in the national character.
                        It is a gross, physical salute to the
                        fantastic <u>possibilities</u> of life in this
                        country.  But only for those with true
                        grit.  And we're chock full of that.

                             DR. GONZO
                        Damn straight.

                             DUKE
                        My attorney understands this, despite
                        his racial handicap.  But you --

     The CAR veers off the road and screeches to a halt.  DR.
     GONZO clutches his heart.

                             DR. GONZO
                        My heart!  Where's the medicine?

     DUKE reaches in the kit bag, pulls out FOUR AMYL CAPSULES.
     Each man breaks two under his nose.

                             DR. GONZO
                        Turn up the fucking music!
                        My heart feels like an alligator!
                        Volume! Clarity!  Bass!

     He flails his arms.  DUKE turns up the radio and tape
     machine full bore, cackling wildly.

                             DUKE
                        What the <u>fuck</u> are we doing out here in
                        the desert when we both have bad hearts?

     Both COLLAPSE LAUGHING.  The HITCHHIKER starts scrambling
     out, over the trunk lid.  DR. GONZO hunches around to face
     him.  The HITCHHIKER freezes.

                             DR. GONZO
                        The truth is. we're going to Vegas
                        to croak a scag baron named Savage
                        Henry.  I've known him for years, but
                        he ripped us off--you know what that
                        means, right?

     The HITCHHIKER is speechless.  DR. GONZO snarls.

                             DR. GONZO
                        Savage Henry has cashed in his check!
                        We're going to rip his lungs out!

                             DUKE
                        And eat them!  The bastard won't
                        get away with this!  What's going on
                        in this country when a... sandbagging...
                        scumsucker... doctors of journalism...

     Blood rushes to DUKE's head.  DR. GONZO cracks another amyl
     under his nose.  The HITCHIKER's feet hit the asphalt and he
     starts running back towards Baker.

                             HITCHHIKER
                        Thanks for the ride!  Thanks a
                        lot!  I <u>like</u> you guys!  Don't
                        worry about me!

                             DUKE
                          (yells)
                        Wait a minute! Come back and
                        have a beer!

     DUKE leans back against the seat, breathing hard.

                             DUKE
                        I'm worried about that boy.

                             DR. GONZO
                        Good riddance.  We had a real freak
                        on our hands.  Did you see his <u>eyes</u>?

     DUKE opens the door and reels around to the driver's side.
     DR GONZO opens a fresh bottle of tequila.

                             DUKE
                        Move over.  We have to get out of
                        California before that kid finds
                        a cop.

                             DR. GONZO
                        Let's turn around and drive back to
                        the Polo Lounge.  They'll never look
                        for us there.

     DUKE stomps on the accelerator.

                             DUKE
                        It's absolutely imperative that we get
                        to the Mint Hotel before the deadline
                        for press registration.  Otherwise we
                        might have to pay for our suite.

     GONZO hands a WHITE BLOTTER to DUKE.

     As the RED SHARK disappears into the desert --

                             DR. GONZO'S VOICE
                        Your half of the acid.  Chew it up
                        like baseball gum.  We have thirty
                        minutes before we turn into wild
                        animals.  As your attorney, I advise
                        you to drive at top speed.

     The SHARK vanishes into a heat haze.  Leaving nothing but
     the desert and the distant figure of the HITCHHIKER, still
     running, behind.


     BLACK SCREEN

                             DUKE'S VOICE
                        Pay no attention to this swine.
                        Actually, we're both Doctors of
                        Journalism, and we're here in Las
                        Vegas to cover the main story of
                        our generation.


     <u>LAS VEGAS MINT HOTEL</u>     EXT     DAY

     DUKE, sweating profusely, holding his beer, hands over the
     RED SHARK to a PARKING ATTENDANT.

     DR. GONZO, behind him, paws frantically through the luggage
     luggage on the sidewalk, looking for his .357 MAGNUM.

                             DR. GONZO
                        Let's forget this bullshit about the
                        American Dream.  The important thing's
                        the Great Samoan Dream.

     DUKE stares fixedly at the TICKET the ATTENDANT gives him.

                             DUKE
                        I need this, right?

                             ATTENDANT
                        It's okay.  I'll remember your face.

     DR. GONZO finds the MAGNUM, sags with relief, pockets it.
     The TWO MEN march toward the HOTEL LOBBY.

                             DUKE
                        Get the story. Never lose sight of
                        the primary responsibility.

                             DR. GONZO
                        What is the story?

     DUKE looks at him blankly as they ENTER THE HOTEL.

                             DUKE V/O
                        Nobody had bothered to say.  We
                        would have to drum it up on our own.
                        Horatio Alger on drugs.  Pure Gonzo
                        journalism.


     <u>MINT HOTEL LOBBY</u>     INT     DAY

     DUKE and GONZO walk to the registration line, past an array
     of CONSUMER GOODS - including several mannequins, one of
     which is dressed in a blue blazer, captain's hat with gold
     braid, tan pants and silk scarf.

                             DR. GONZO
                          (manically)
                        First thing -- immediately -- room
                        service. We need four club sandwiches,
                        four shrimp cocktails, a quart of rum.
                        nine grapefruit.  Vitamin C.
                        WE'LL NEED ALL WE CAN GET.

     EVERYONE IN LINE TURNS AND STARES AT THEM.

                             DUKE
                        Let me handle this.
                          (mutters to himself as they
                          push to the front of the line)
                        Be quiet, be calm... name, rank, and
                        press afilliation, nothing else...
                        ignore this terrible drug, pretend
                        it's not happening...

     And he comes face to face with the STONY-FACED WOMAN
     RESERVATIONS CLERK.  As he stares at her, babbling, her FACE
     BEGINS TO MORPH.  Shimmers around the edges.  Goes rubbery.

                             DUKE
                        Hi there.  My name... ah, Raoul Duke...
                        on...on <u>that</u> list, that's for sure.
                        Free lunch, final wisdom, total
                        coverage... why not?  I have my
                        attorney with me, and I realize of
                        course that <u>his</u> name is not on the
                        list, but we <u>must</u> have that suite.
                        Yes.  Just check the list and
                        you'll see.  Don't worry.  What's the
                        score here?

                             RESERVATIONS CLERK
                          (face MORPHING back to normal;
                          she holds out an ENVELOPE)
                        Your suite's not ready yet.  But
                        there's somebody looking for you.

                             DUKE
                          (shouts)
                        No!  Why?  We haven't <u>done</u> anything yet!

     At this, the RESERVATIONS CLERK MORPHS into the green jowls
     and fangs of a MORAY EEL... DUKE screams, lunges back at DR.
     GONZO, who reaches out and takes the ENVELOPE.

                             DR. GONZO
                        I'll handle this.  This man has
                        a bad heart, but I have plenty of
                        medicine.  My name is Dr. Gonzo,
                        Prepare our suite at once.
                        We'll be in the bar.

     They stagger across an insanely crowded lobby toward the
     BAR.  No one pays any attention to them.


     <u>MINT HOTEL BAR</u>     INT     DAY

     They enter the BAR. decorated with a NAUTICAL THEME.

                             DUKE
                          (muttering)
                        There's so much blood on this floor,
                        we're going to have to order golf shoes
                        just to walk.

     They sit at TWO BAR STOOLS at the edge of the lobby.  DUKE
     holds onto the decorative fish netting to keep his balance.

     HiS POV -- the MINT 400 REGISTRATION DESK.

                             DR. GONZO
                          (at a BARTENDER)
                        Two cuba libres, beer and mescal
                        on the side.
                          (opens the ENVELOPE)
                        From your contact, Lacerda.  He
                        wants to meet us.

     ANGLE ON DUKE'S HORRIFIED FACE.   His POV again --
     the bar is now populated by GIANT REPTILES.  One of them
     gnaws on a GIANT BIRD's neck.  BLOOD flows freely across the
     floor.

                             DUKE
                        But what about our room?  And the
                        golf shoes?  We're right in the
                        middle of a fucking reptile zoo!  And
                        somebody's giving <u>booze</u> to these
                        goddamn things!  It won't be long before
                        they tear us to shreds.

     A GROUP OF REPTILES AT THE REGISTRATION DESK stares at them.
     blood dripping from their fangs.

                             DUKE
                        How many have they killed already?
                        Holy shit!  Look at that bunch over
                        there!  They've spotted us!

                             DR. GONZO
                          (downs his drink; gets up)
                        That's the press table.  That's where
                        you have to sign in for our credentials.
                        You handle that.  and I'll check on the
                        room.

                             DUKE
                        No, no.  Don't leave me.

     But when he looks, DR. GONZO has disappeared.  He looks
     around at the GHASTLY REPTILE ZOO.  Carefully, he detaches a
     MARLIN SPIKE from the nautical decorations at the bar, and,
     holding it raised in his fist, walks OUT OF FRAME --

     LIGHTNING FLASH

     HISSES and SCREAMS as of a ferocious battle with REPTILES.

     FADE IN FROM WHITE --


     <u>MINT HOTEL SUITE</u>     INT     DUSK

     DUKE, still clutching the MARLIN SPIKE, stares wildly out
     the window.  Myriad colors flash across his face.  Behind
     him, at the door, DR. GONZO signs for a large room service
     order from a vaguely reptilian WAITER.

                             DUKE
                        Look outside.

                             DR. GONZO
                        Why?

     DR. GONZO escorts the cart the length of the suite, to where
     DUKE is transfixed by the gigantic neon sign outside the
     window - millions of colored balls racing around a
     complicated track, giving off a loud hum...

                             DUKE
                        There's a big... machine in the sky...
                        some kind of electric snake... coming
                        straight at us.

     On the room service cart lie four club sandwiches, four
     shrimp cocktails, a quart of rum and nine grapefruit.
     DR. GONZO pulls one apart with his hands.

                             DR. GONZO
                        Shoot it.

                             DUKE
                        Not yet. I want to study its
                        habits.

     DR. GONZO turns on the TV.  The NIGHTLY NEWS.  A BUDDHIST
     MONK, protesting the war, sets himself on fire.

     He goes over to the corner, pulls on the chain to close the
     drapes.

                             DR. GONZO
                        Look.  You've got to stop this talk
                        about snakes and leeches and lizards
                        and that stuff.  It's making me sick.

                             DUKE
                        Don't worry.

                             DR. GONZO
                        <u>Worry</u>?  Jesus.  I almost went crazy
                        down there.  They'll never let us back
                        in that bar - not after your scene at
                        the press table.

                             DUKE
                        What scene?

                             DR. GONZO
                        You bastard!  I left you alone for
                        <u>three</u> <u>minutes</u>.  You scared the shit
                        out of those people, waving that goddamn
                        marlin spike around and yelling about
                        reptiles.  You're lucky I carne back in
                        time.  They were ready to call the caps.
                        I said you were only drunk, and I'd take
                        you upstairs for a cold shower.  Hell...
                        the only reason they gave us press passes
                        was to get you out of there.
                          (paws through the kit bag)
                        That straightened me right out.

     The PHONE rings.  DUKE cautiously picks it up.

                             DR. GONZO
                        I must have some drugs.  What
                        have you done with the mescaline?

     DUKE grabs the kit bag from GONZO, finds the mescaline.
     They both pop some pellets.

                             DUKE
                          (to PHONE)
                        Hello?

                             DR. GONZO
                        Maybe you should go easy on the
                        mescaline.  That acid's still
                        working on you.

                             VOICE ON PHONE
                        Thompson?  Hunter S. Thompson?
                        Innes here.  About that ape.

                             DUKE
                          (screams; drops the PHONE)
                        OH MY GOD!  They're on to us!  That
                        man KNOWS MY REAL NAME!

     DR. GONZO tackles him again. hangs up the phone.  He whips
     the .357 MAGNUM from his waistband and holds it to DUKE'S
     HEAD.

                             DR. GONZO
                          (cooing)
                        Don't you remember?  You gave your
                        real name to some guy you met in the bar.
                        He was telling you about a trained ape.
                        You told him you wanted to buy it,
                        you fool.

     A KNOCK ON THE DOOR.

                             DUKE
                          (moans)
                        Oh my God.  Who's that?

     DR. GONZO sticks his gun in his waistband and goes to the
     door.  DUKE turns his attention to the TELEVISION.  The LAOS
     INVASION.  Explosions.  Men fleeing in terror.  A Pentagon
     general pointing at a map.

     DR. GONZO opens the door to LACERDA, the photographer.
     Healthy, eager, fit.

                             LACERDA
                          (shakes hands)
                        Duke?  I'm Lacerda.  Your photographer.
                        Got your press passes?  Good, good.  Too
                        bad you missed the bikes checking in.
                        My, that was a sight.  Husquavarnas.
                        Yamahas, Kawasakis, couple of Triumphs,
                        here and there a CZ...all very fast!
                        What a race it's gonna be.  Well.  We
                        start at dawn.  Get a goodnight's sleep.
                        I know I will!

     And with a cheerful wave, he's gone.

     DR GONZO turns back to the business at hand.

                             DUKE
                        That's good.  They'll probably have
                        a big net ready for us when we show up.

                             DR. GONZO
                        As your attorney I advise you not to
                        worry about me.  Let's carve up this
                        grapefruit, make a fine rum punch.
                        maybe toss in some more blotter...
                        What's that you're watching?

     He and DUKE watch the TELEVISION in silence.  BURNING,
     TWISTED WRECKAGE.

     DR GONZO charges like a bull at the TELEVISION.

                             DR. GONZO
                          (lunges for the dial)
                        TURN THAT SHIT OFF!

     SCREEN GOES BLACK.

     THE SOUND OF MOTORCYCLES REVVING THEIR ENGINES.


     <u>DESERT</u>     EXT     DAWN

     SUNRISE.  A cool, bright DAWN.
     The SOUND OF SHOTGUNS BLASTING.  And MOTORCYCLES REVVING off
     screen.  CRANE DOWN as the RED SHARK drives up to the MINT
     GUN CLUB.  GUYS taking dawn TARGET PRACTICE.

                             DUKE V/O
                        The racers were ready at dawn.  Fine
                        sunrise over the desert.  Very tense.
                        But the race didn't start until nine.
                        so we had to kill about three long hours
                        in the casino next to the pits.  That's
                        where the trouble started.


     <u>RACE BAR TENT</u>     INT     MORNING

     Crap tables.  Smoke.  Drunken shouting.  Might as well be
     the middle of the night on the Strip.

     DUKE, his ever-present beer in hand, makes his way through
     the crowd toward the BAR, where a drunken REPORTER slides
     off his barstool.

                             DUKE V/O
                        The bar opened at seven.  There was
                        a "koffee and donuts canteen" in the
                        bunker, but those of us who had been up
                        all night in places like the Circus
                        Circus were in no mood for coffee and
                        donuts.  We wanted strong drink.

     DUKE slides onto a newly vacated barstool next to the
     REPORTER.

     A HOODLUM in a Vincent Black Shadow t-shirt bellies up to
     the bar.

                             HOODLUM
                        God damn!  What day is this--
                        Saturday?

                             DUKE
                        More like Sunday.

                             HOODLUM
                        Hah!  That's a <u>bitch</u>, ain't it?  Last
                        night I was home in Long Beach and
                        somebody said they were runnin' the
                        Mint 400 today, so I says to my
                        old lady, "Man. I'm goin'."  So she gives
                        me a lot of crap about it, so I start
                        slappin' her around, and the next thing
                        you know two guys I never seen before
                        are beating me stupid.  Then they gave
                        me ten bucks, put me on a bus, and when
                        I woke up it was dawn and here I was in
                        downtown Vegas, and for a minute all I
                        could think was, "O Jesus, who's
                        divorcing me this time?"  But then I
                        remembered, by God!  I was here for the
                        Mint 400.  And, man, I tell you, it's
                        wonderful to be here.  Just wonderful to
                        be here with you people.

                        This is a magic moment in sport!  It
                        may never come again!  I once did the
                        Triple Crown, but it was nothing like
                        this.

                        Stand up!  <u>Please</u> stand up!  You'd

                        I am.  You'd go crazy if I stood up!

     A bright-eyed, camera-hung LACERDA appears.

                             LACERDA
                          (to BARTENDER)

                        What?

                             DUKE
                        I said, and here we are, the absolute
                        cream of the sporting press, gathered
                        to cover it.

     LACERDA grins.  A SHOUT goes up from outside.

                             LACERDA
                        That's it!  The flag's going down.
                        Meet you outside!

     He hurries out through the crowd.  DUKE, carrying two
     drinks, follows.

     Much shouting.  But the crowd's too thick to get through in
     time.  All they can see is a FLAG GOING DOWN and a CLOUD OF
     DUST.

     The SOUND OF THE RACE STARTING.

     A CHEER goes up, and the CROWD turns, streams back into the
     tent.

                             REPORTER 2
                        Well, that's that.  They'll be
                        back in an hour or so.  Let's go
                        back to the bar.


     <u>RACE BAR TENT</u>     EXT     DAY

     DUKE and GONZO run outside.  Nothing.  Except for a THICK
     CLOUD OF DUST.  LACERDA enthusiastically photographs the
     DUST.

                             LACERDA
                          (shouts)
                        I'll just keep trying combos of film
                        and lenses till I find one that works
                        in this dust!


     <u>DESERT</u>     EXT     DAY

     The HUGE IMPENETRABLE CLOUD OF DUST.
     The SOUND OF MOTORCYCLES RACING.

     A moment later, the RED SHARK races out of the dust.
     LACERDA at the wheel.  DUKE next to him, coughing, choking,
     trying to find the trail.  DUKE drinks a beer.

                             DUKE
                        Wait!  I hear one!  Over there!

     The RED SHARK bounces over boulders.  A BIKE sounds on the
     opposite direction.

                             LACERDA
                        No!  There!

     They are LOST IN THE CLOUD OF DUST.  Coughing, they stop.
     Listen.

     The SOUND OF A MOTOR VEHICLE DRAWING NEAR.  SHOTS BEING
     FIRED.  SHOUTING AND HOOTING.

     DUKE stands, like a lone gunfighter preparing to meet the
     enemy.

     OUT OF THE DUST - A DUNE BUGGY races toward them, loaded
     down with THREE RETIRED MILITARY MEN, drunk as hell, heavily
     armed.

     Their RADIO blares "THE BATTLE HYMN OF LIEUTENANT CALLEY."

     The DUNE BUGGY is decorated with Screaming Eagles carrying
     American Flags in their claws.  A slant-eyed Snake being
     chopped to bits by a buzz-saw made of stars and stripes.
     A machine gun mount on the passenger side.

     The DUNE BUGGY races over and stops, MUSIC BLARING.  All
     have to YELL to make themselves heard.

                             DUNE BUGGY DRIVER
                        We're looking for the race.  Where
                        <u>is</u> the damn thing?

                             DUKE
                        Beats me.  We're just good patriotic
                        Americans like yourself.

     The DUNE BUGGYISTS eye LACERDA, who is clearly <u>not</u> of the
     white American persuasion.

                             DUNE BUGGY PASSENGER #1
                          (sings along with radio)
                        "We responded to their rifle fire with
                        everything we had..."

                             DUNE BUGGY DRIVER
                          (suspiciously)
                        What <u>outfit</u> you fellows with?

     DUNE BUGGY PASSENGER #2 eyes them, automatic weapon held
     across his chest.

                             DUKE
                        The sporting press.  We're friendlies.
                        Hired geeks.

     The DRIVER and DUNE BUGGY PASSENGER #2 exchange looks.

                             DUKE
                        If you want a good chase, you
                        should get after that skunk from
                        CBS News up ahead in the black jeep.
                        He's the man responsible for THE
                        SELLING OF THE PENTAGON.

     All in the DUNE BUGGY brighten.

                             DUNE BUGGY PASSENGER #1
                        HOT DAMN!

                             DUNE BUGGY PASSENGER #2
                        A black jeep, you say?

     And they ROAR away.

                             DUNE BUGGY DRIVER
                        THANKS FOR THE TIP!

     LACERDA screeches off in the opposite direction, waking DR.
     GONZO, who has been asleep in the back seat of the SHARK,
     and yanking DUKE down in a heap on the seat, spilling his
     beer.

                             DUKE
                        You're fired.  Take me back to the pits.

     CUT TO:


     <u>DESERT HIGHWAY</u>     EXT     DAY

     The RED SHARK drives out of the dust cloud, onto the highway
     back toward Las Vegas, past a GIANT BILLBOARD that says:

                           DON'T GAMBLE WITH MARIJUANA!
                         IN NEVADA:  POSSESSION--20 YEARS
                                   SALE--LIFE!

     DR. GONZO sits with his feet up on the back seat -- dressed
     in a new blue blazer, captain's hat with gold braid, tan
     pants and silk scarf.

                             DR. GONZO
                        Is that mescaline working for you?
                        It's not <u>working</u> for me.


     <u>LAS VEGAS STREETS</u>     EXT     NIGHT

     LACERDA has been left at the hotel.  DUKE, beer in hand,
     drives.  DR. GONZO, in his nautical outfit, scans <u>The</u> <u>Vegas</u>
     <u>Visitor</u>.  They each take another mescaline pellet.

                             DR. GONZO
                        How about "Nickel Nick's Slot Arcade"?
                        "Hot Slots," that sounds heavy.
                        Twenty-nine cent hotdogs....

                             DUKE
                        We should go see the Debbie Reynolds
                        show at the Desert Inn.  I don't know
                        about you, but in my line of business,
                        it's important to be Hep.

                             DR. GONZO
                        Mine too.  But as your attorney I
                        advise you to drive over to the
                        Tropicana and pickup on Guy Lombardo.
                        He's in the Blue Room with his Royal
                        Canadians.

                             DUKE
                        Why?

                             DR. GONZO
                        Why <u>what</u>?

                             DUKE
                        Why should I pay out my hard-earned
                        dollars to watch a fucking corpse?

                             DR. GONZO
                        Look.  Why are we out here?  To
                        entertain ourselves, or to <u>do</u> <u>the</u>
                        <u>job</u>?

                             DUKE
                        The job, of course.


     <u>DESERT INN</u>     EXT     NIGHT

     He turns suddenly, and, after a series of bumps, the RED
     SHARK comes to a halt.

     A DOORMAN appears, waving his hands and screaming.

                             DOORMAN
                        What the hell are you doing?
                        You can't park <u>here</u>!

                             DUKE
                        Why not?

     PULL BACK to reveal the RED SHARK parked on the sidewalk in
     front of the DESERT INN.  The MARQUEE says:  TONIGHT.
     DEBBIE REYNOLDS.

     DR. GONZO leaps from the car, hands the DOORMAN a bill.

                             DR. GONZO
                        We want this car parked!  I'm
                        an old friend of Debbie's.  I
                        used to <u>romp</u> with her.

     The DOORMAN pockets the bill, hands them a parking stub.
     Our HEROES hurry toward the hotel.

                             DUKE
                        That was quick thinking.

                             DR. GONZO
                        What do you expect?  I'm your
                        attorney.  And you owe me five
                        bucks.  I want it <u>now</u>.

     DUKE hands it over.


     <u>DESERT INN HOTEL LOBBY</u>     INT     NIGHT

     The REPORTER from the Mint 400 chants his story into a lobby
     phone, surrounded by PLASTIC PALM TREES.

                             REPORTER
                        LAS VEGAS AT DAWN--the racers are still
                        asleep, the dust is still on the desert.
                        $50.000 in prize money slumbers darkly
                        in the office safe at the fabulous Mint
                        Hotel.  And the cream of the sporting
                        press is here, as always, with a sturdy
                        police escort... yes, operator, that
                        word was <u>police</u>...

     DUKE and GONZO enter, pass him by, hurrying toward the GRAND
     BALLROOM--which is guarded by a MAN IN A WINE-COLORED
     TUXEDO.

                             DUKE V/O
                        This was Bob Hope's turf.  Frank
                        Sinatra's.  Spiro Agnew's.  The
                        lobby reeked of high-grade formica.
                        Clearly a high-class refuge for
                        Big Spenders.

     DUKE, the mescaline kicking in again, stares at a huge
     photograph of DEBBIE REYNOLDS and the BEE GEES.  His eyes
     come to rest of DR. GONZO, arguing with the MAN IN THE WINE-
     COLORED TUXEDO.

                             GONZO
                        What do you mean it's full?
                        Fuck seats.  We're old friends of
                        Debbie's.  We drove all the way from
                        L.A. for this show, and we're goddamn
                        well going in.

     Argument.  More BILLS exchange hands.

                             DUKE V/O
                        Finally, after a lot of bad noise.
                        he let us in.  Provided we would
                        stand quietly in back and not smoke.


     <u>GRAND BALLROOM STANDING ROOM</u>     INT     NIGHT

     Our HEROES stand, transfixed, at a STAGE that we never see.
     DUKE's hand automatically reaches inside his pocket for a
     HASH PIPE.

                             DUKE V/O
                        We promised, of course, but the
                        tension had been too great.

     The SOUNDS OF A HIGHLY BLANDIZED ROCK SONG waft from the
     stage.

                             DUKE
                        Did the mescaline just kick in?
                        Or is that Debbie Reynolds in a
                        silver Afro wig?

                             DR. GONZO
                          (yells)
                        JESUS CREEPING SHIT, WE'VE
                        WANDERED INTO A TIME CAPSULE.

     HEAVY HANDS grab them from behind as DUKE jams the PIPE back
     into his pocket.


     <u>DESERT INN</u>     EXT     NIGHT

     Our HEROES are thrown through the front door, as the RED
     SHARK is driven up.

                             WINE-COLORED TUXEDO
                        If Debbie has friends like you guys,
                        she's in worse trouble than I thought.

     The RED SHARK drives away, DUKE at the wheel.  GONZO stands
     on the passenger side, yelling.

                             DR. GONZO
                        We'll see about this!  You paranoid scum!

                             DUKE
                        We'll go to the Circus Circus Casino.
                        They'll never fuck with us there.

     The TAILLIGHTS disappear down the street.

                             DR. GONZO'S VOICE
                        I'm telling you, this mescaline isn't
                        <u>working</u>.  Where's the ether?


     <u>CIRCUS CIRCUS PARKING LOT</u>     EXT     NIGHT

     RED SHARK parked.  DUKE smokes the hash pipe in front.

     DR. GONZO appears from the trunk bearing ether.  He pours it
     on two kleenex, which both men hold up to their noses.

     They get out of the car, laughing hysterically, falling over
     each other, reeling like drunks in an early Irish novel.

                        This is the main advantage of ether.
                        Total loss of all basic motor skills--                        
                        severance of all connection between
                        body and brain.  Which is interesting,
                        because the brain continues to function
                        more or less normally.  You can actually
                        <u>watch</u> yourself behaving in this terrible
                        way, but you can't control it.


     <u>CIRCUS CIRCUS CASINO</u>     INT     NIGHT

     At the TURNSTYLES, DUKE and GONZO bounce off the walls,
     crash into OLD LADIES, giggle helplessly as they try to pay.

                             DUKE V/O
                        Ah, devil ether.  A total body drug.
                        The mind recoils in horror, unable to
                        communicate with the spinal column.
                        Hands flap crazily, unable to get money
                        out of pocket...garbled laughter and
                        hissing from the mouth...always
                        smiling...

     The ATTENDANTS help the MEN with their money and tenderly
     escort them through the turnstyles.

                             DUKE V/O
                        Ether is the perfect drug for Las
                        Vegas.  In this town they love a drunk.
                        Fresh meat.  So they put us through the
                        turnstiles and turned us loose inside.


     <u>CIRCUS CIRCUS REVOLVING MERRY-GO-ROUND BAR</u>     INT     NIGHT

     DUKE and GONZO sit, glassy-eyed, on the revolving platform,
     gazing ahead of them.  GONZO shakes uncontrollably.  The
     other PATRONS stare.

                             DUKE V/O
                        Four stories above our heads, a
                        half-naked fourteen year old girl
                        was being chased through the air
                        by a snarling Wolverine and six nymphet
                        sisters from San Diego.  Suddenly
                        the Wolverine was locked in a death
                        battle with two silver-pained Polacks
                        -- seizing the animal they fall towards
                        the crap tables -- shoot the pasties
                        off the nipples of a ten-foot bull-
                        dyke -- win a cotton-candy goat.

     A loudly-dressed MIDWAY HUSTLER steps up to them.  He
     carries a large CAMERA attatched to a long TUBE.

                             HUSTLER
                        Stand in front of this fantastic
                        machine, my friends, and for just
                        99c your likeness will appear.
                        two hundred feet tall, on a screen
                        above downtown Las Vegas!
                          (he sticks the CAMERA in
                           DR. GONZO's face)
                        Say whatever you want, fella.
                        They'll hear you, don't worry about
                        that.  Remember, you'll be two
                        hundred feet tall!

                             DUKE
                        This is what the whole hep world
                        would be doing on Saturday night
                        if the Nazis had won the war.

     DR GONZO pisses his pants.  The HUSTLER, disgusted, turns
     away.

                             DR. GONZO
                        This place is getting to me.
                        I'm getting the Fear.

                             DUKE
                        Nonsense.  We came here to find
                        the American Dream, and now we're
                        in the vortex.  You must <u>realize</u>
                        that we've found the main nerve.

                             DR. GONZO
                        That's what gives me the Fear.

                             DUKE
                        Look over there.  Two women fucking
                        a Polar Bear.

                             DR. GONZO
                          (shouts)
                        Don't fuck around!  One more hour
                        in this town and I'll kill somebody!

     He leaps up, shivering and sweating, runs to the edge of the
     turntable.

                             DR. GONZO
                        When does this thing stop?

     DUKE carefully gets up, walks past him off the turntable.

                             DUKE
                        It's not <u>ever</u> going to stop.

     He reaches out to grab GONZO, who, recoiling in fear, is
     carried around one more time.

                             DUKE V/O
                        We were both out of our heads.
                        If we wanted to avoid jail, the
                        thing to do was <u>leave</u> <u>quietly</u>.

     Duke leaps on to the merry-go-round and shoves GONZO from
     behind.  GONZO goes down with a hellish scream.

     DUKE leaps off the turntable, hurries away.  GONZO scrambles
     after him.

                             DR. GONZO                        
                        Somebody pushed me!

                             DUKE
                        The bartender.  He didn't like
                        you flirting with the Polar Bear.

                             DR. GONZO
                        Jesus!  Let's get out of here!
                        Where's the elevator?

                             DUKE
                        Don't go <u>near</u> that elevator. That's
                        just what they want...trap us in a steel
                        box and take us down to the basement.
                        And don't run.  They'd like an excuse
                        to shoot us.

     They disappear into DARKNESS.

                             DUKE V/O
                        No, This is not a good town for
                        psychedelic drugs.  Reality itself
                        is too twisted.


     <u>MINT HOTEL</u>     INT     NIGHT

     An ELEVATOR DOOR opens to reveal a BRIGHT LIGHT--and the
     SMILING FACES of LACERDA, the BLONDE TV REPORTER and HER
     CREW.


     <u>MINT HOTEL ELEVATOR</u>     INT     NIGHT

     DUKE and DR. GONZO stagger into the bright light of their
     hotel elevator.  Both are a mess.

     A shaking GONZO hovers moonily around a BLONDE TV REPORTER.

                             LACERDA
                          (to DUKE)
                        Ran into a guy named Innes.
                        He's looking for you.  Something
                        about an ape.

                             BLONDE TV REPORTER
                          (babbles nervously to DR. GONZO)
                        Exciting race, wasn't it?  Did you
                        see the finish?

                             DR. GONZO
                        I was <u>in</u> the finish.

                             BLONDE TV REPORTER
                        What?  What class were you in?
                        I mean what did you ride?

                             DR. GONZO
                        I RIDE THE <u>BIG</u> <u>ONES</u>.  THE REALLY
                        <u>BIG</u> FUCKERS!

     DUKE laughs, tries to defuse the situation.

     DR. GONZO turns slowly and ominously.

                             DR. GONZO
                        Pardon me, lady, but I think there's
                        some kind of ignorant chicken-sucker
                        in this car who needs his face cut open.

     From his pocket, he pulls out a GLEAMING HUNTING KNIFE.
     The ELEVATOR DOOR opens and closes.  Nobody moves.

                             DR. GONZO
                        You cheap honky faggots!  Which one
                        of you wants to get cut?

     DUKE, sweating, watches the ELEVATOR NUMBERS.  Their floor.


     <u>MINT HOTEL HALLWAY</u>     INT     NIGHT

     GONZO emerges from the elevator, nonchalantly sheathing his
     knife.  DUKE looks back into the silent elevator as the
     doors close.  We do not see inside.


     <u>MINT HOTEL SUITE</u>     INT     NIGHT

                             DR. GONZO
                          (laughs manically)
                        Spooked!  Did you see that?  They
                        were like rats in a death cage!

                             DUKE
                        Where'd you get that knife?

                             DR. GONZO
                        Room service sent it up.  Along
                        with the other stuff.  I wanted
                        something to cut the limes.

     DUKE surveys the room.  AN INCREDIBLE ARRAY OF EXPENSIVE
     GOODS sent by room service.  Liquor.  Baccarat crystal.  A
     full set of calfskin luggage.  Six hundred bars of
     Neutrogena soap.  Everything but limes.

                             DUKE
                        What limes?

                             DR. GONZO
                        They didn't have any. They don't
                        grow in the desert.

     He opens a new bottle of tequila with his teeth and chugs
     it.  DUKE watches him warily.  GONZO slices a grapefruit
     into quarters, then eighths, then sixteenths, then starts
     slashing aimlessly at the residue.

                             DUKE V/O
                        One of the things you learn, after years
                        of dealing with drug people, is that you
                        can turn your back on a person, but never
                        turn your back on a drug.  Especially
                        when it's waving a razor-sharp hunting
                        knife in your eyes.

                             DUKE
                        Look.  I've got to get some rest.
                        Why don't you take a shower or something.

     DR. GONZO eyes him malevolently.  Turns with the tequila
     bottle, tucks another one under his arm, and lumbers toward
     the bath.

                             DR. GONZO
                        That girl in the elevator understood.
                        It's serious.  She's in love with me
                        now.

     DUKE sags with relief.  Too soon.  DR. GONZO stiffens as
     another paranoid thought races through his addled brain.
     Stiffens and ominously turns.

                             DR. GONZO
                        You made a deal with him.

                             DUKE
                        What?  Who?

                             DR. GONZO
                        That Portuguese son of a bitch.
                        Lacerda!  I knew it!  He's stolen
                        my woman!  They're upstairs
                        together now!  And <u>you</u> put him
                        onto her!

     He lunges at DUKE, who whips a CAN OF MACE from the kit bag.

                             DUKE
                        MACE!  YOU WANT <u>THIS</u>?

     He waves the CAN wildly.  GONZO stops.  Hisses.

                             DR. GONZO
                        You bastard!  You'd <u>do</u> that,
                        wouldn't you?

                             DUKE
                          (laughs)
                        Why worry? You'll <u>like</u> it.
                        Nothing in the world like a mace
                        high.  Forty-five minutes on your
                        knees with the dry heaves...

                             DR. GONZO
                        You cheap honky sonofabitch...

                             DUKE
                        There's no choice.  I can't go
                        to sleep with you wandering around
                        with a head full of acid and wanting
                        to slice me up with that goddamn knife!

                             DR. GONZO
                          (mumbles)
                        Who said anything about slicing you
                        up?  I just wanted to carve a little
                        Z on your forehead.  In memory of
                        Lieutenant Calley.  Nothing serious.

                             DUKE
                          (menaces him with the MACE)
                        Get in that bathroom.  Eat some reds,
                        try to calm down, smoke some grass,
                        -- shit, do whatever you have to do,
                        but let me get some rest.

     GONZO turns toward the bathroom, muttering earnestly.

                             DR. GONZO
                        Hell, yes.  You really <u>need</u> to sleep.
                        You have to <u>work</u>.  God damn.  What
                        a bummer.
                          (waves his hand)
                        Try to rest.  Don't let me keep you up.

     GONZO shuffles into the bathroom.  DUKE jams a chair up
     against the doorknob, locking him in.  Looks at the alarm
     clock.  It says 6:00 a.m.  He sets the alarm.  Puts the MACE
     CAN next to the clock.  Turns on the TV.  NEWS.  He rolls a
     joint.

                        I ain't got nothin' against them
                        Viet Congs.

     Changes the channel again.  The BOGART MOVIE again.  DUKE
     watches for a moment as BOGART overpowers a cheap GUNSEL.
     Then he finishes his joint, and finds a DEAD CHANNEL.
     WHITE NOISE fills the room.

     DUKE leans back in his chair. puts on his sunglasses, and
     falls asleep.


     <u>SAME</u> - HALF HOUR LATER

     The SOUND OF JEFFERSON AIRPLANE'S "WHITE RABBIT" seeps out
     from under the bathroom door.

     DAWN seeps in under the window shades.

                             DUKE V/O
                        The decision to flee came suddenly.

     The MUSIC goes off abruptly.  Tape being rewound.

                             DUKE V/O
                        Or maybe not. Maybe I'd planned it
                        all along.  Subconsciously waited
                        for the right moment.

     MORE MUSIC BLASTS OUT OF THE BATHROOM AT TWICE FULL VOLUME.
     DUKE jumps awake, knocking the MACE CAN and the ALARM CLOCK
     to the floor.  The ALARM goes off.  The MACE discharges on
     the carpet.  Coughing, horribly groggy, DUKE stomps at the
     CAN with his foot.  Grabs a PAPER from the room service cart
     to wipe his eyes.  Looks at it.  The BILL.

                             DUKE V/O
                        The bill was a factor, I think.
                        Room service.  Here I was in Las
                        Vegas, with this goddamn incredibly
                        expensive car, completely twisted on
                        drugs, no cash, no story for the
                        magazine--and on top of everything else.
                        I had a gigantic goddamn hotel bill
                        to deal with.  Sure, I never signed
                        anything with my real name.  But could
                        I count on that?

     The MUSIC stops.  And STARTS UP AGAIN.  LOUDER.

                             DUKE
                        Will you shut that fucking thing off!

     He kicks the chair away from the bathroom door and charges
     in.


     <u>THE BATHROOM</u>     INT     DAY

     A GREEN FOG STEAMBATH.
     DR. GONZO wallows in a slickly surfaced steaming tub.
     The TAPE PLAYER wails, from where it's plugged in over the
     sink.  DUKE yanks out the cord.  And then notices a HUGE
     HUNK OF CHEWED UP WHITE BLOTTER in the sink.

                             DUKE
                        You ate this?  ALL THIS ACID?

     No answer.  GONZO flails in the tub as if the music still
     plays.  SFX -- his head breaks into molecules which revolve
     around the room.

                             DUKE
                        You evil son of a bitch.  You
                        better hope there's some thorazine
                        around here, because if there's not,
                        you're in bad trouble.

                             DR. GONZO
                        Music.  Turn it up.  Put that tape on.

                             DUKE
                        What tape?

                             DR. GONZO
                        Jefferson Airplane.  "White Rabbit."
                        I want a <u>rising</u> sound.

                             DUKE
                        You're doomed.  I'm leaving here
                        in fifteen minutes, and then they're
                        going to come up here and beat the
                        mortal shit out of you with big saps.
                        Right there in that tub.

                             DR. GONZO
                        I dig my own graves.  Green water and
                        the White Rabbit.  Put it on.  Don't
                        make me use this.

     His arm flashes out of the water, holding the KNIFE.

                             DUKE
                        Jesus.

     He plugs in the tape/radio player, and switches on the tape.
     "WHITE RABBIT" begins to build.

                             DR. GONZO
                        Let it roll.  Just as high as the tucker
                        can go!  And when it comes to that
                        fantastic note where the rabbit bites its
                        own head off, I wan t you to THROW THAT
                        FUCKING RADIO INTO THE TUB WITH ME!

     DUKE switches off the machine.  They are frozen in a
     STANDOFF

                             DUKE V/O
                        This is it, I thought.  I've gone as
                        far as I can with this waterhead.  This
                        time it's a suicide trip.  This time he
                        wants it.  He's ready...

                             DUKE
                        Oh no.  Not this radio.  It would blast
                        you right through the wall--stone dead in
                        ten seconds.  Shit, they'd make me
                        <u>explain</u> it.  Drag me down to some rotten
                        coroner's inquest and grill me about the
                        <u>exact details</u>--

                             DR. GONZO
                        BULLSHIT!  Just tell them I wanted
                        to get HIGHER!

     DUKE consIders this.

                             DUKE
                        Okay.  You're right.  This is
                        probably the only solution.
                          (holds the PLUGGED IN TAPE/RADIO
                          over the tub)
                        Let me make sure I have it all lined up.
                        You want me to throw this thing into the
                        tub when "WHITE RABBIT" peaks.  Is that
                        it?

     DR. GONZO sinks gratefully back into the water.

                             DR. GONZO
                        Fuck yes.  I was beginning to think
                        I was going to have to go out and get
                        one of the goddamn <u>maids</u> to do it.

                             DUKE
                        Don't worry.  Are you ready?

     He switches "WHITE RABBIT" back on.  GONZO howls and moans
     and thrashes to the MUSIC, straining to get over the top.
     Meanwhile, DUKE sorts through a PILE OF GRAPEFRUIT on the
     sink.  Picking out a good two-pounder, he gets a grip on it-
     -and when "WHITE RABBIT" peaks, he lashes it into the tub
     like a cannonball.

     GONZO screams crazily, thrashing and churning in the tub.

     DUKE grabs the TAPE/RADIO DECK, jams out of the bathroom--


     <u>MINT HOTEL SUITE</u>     INT     DAY

     -- and out of the soundproof suite, grabbing his bag and his
     mace as he goes.


     <u>BATHROOM</u>     INT     DAY

     GONZO floats in the tub, a beatific last smile on his face.


     <u>MINT HOTEL ELEVATOR</u>     INT     DAY

     A foot-tapping, beer-drinking DUKE watches the floor numbers
     as the elevator descends.  Checks his pockets.  Pulls out
     THREE FIVE DOLLAR BILLS.


     <u>MINT HOTEL LOBBY</u>     INT     DAY

     DUKE hurries out of the elevator, gives a BILL to the MINION
     waiting there, who instantly barks an order into the house
     phone.

     Motoring, DUKE moves to the HOTEL FRONT DOORWAY, where he
     gives another BILL to the DOORMAN, who blows a frantic
     whistle and waves at the CAR BOY.

                             DUKE V/O
                        Now it was only a matter of slipping
                        the noose.  Yes, extremely casual
                        behavior, wild eyes hidden behind
                        these Saigon-mirror sunglasses, waiting
                        for the Shark to roll up....


     <u>MINT HOTEL</u>     EXT     DAY

     The CAR BOY pulls up with a SCREECH, DUKE throws him the
     last BILL and jumps in.  Deliverance!

                             BELLBOY'S VOICE
                        MR. DUKE!

     DUKE freezes.  Then turns on the ignition.

                             BELLBOY'S VOICE
                        Mr. Duke!  We've been looking for you!

     DUKE shifts into drive.  The BELLBOY appears, breathlessly
     hurling himself at the side of the car.  DUKE leans his head
     on the steering wheel in resignation.  Then turns a sickly
     smile on the BELLBOY.  Turns off the ignition.

                             DUKE
                        Well...why not?  I'm too tired to resist.
                        Many fine books have been written in
                        prison.

                             BELLBOY
                        Sir?

     He thrusts out a TELEGRAM.

                             BELLBOY
                        This telegram came for you.  Actually,
                        it <u>isn't</u> for you.  It's for somebody
                        named Thompson, but it says '<u>care</u> <u>of</u>
                        Raoul Duke'.  Does that make sense?
                        I figured this man Thompson might be
                        part of your team.

                             DUKE
                        He is.  Absolutely.  The thing to do
                        is give this telegram to Dr. Gonzo.
                        The Doctor handles all our finances,
                        makes all our arrangements.

     He turns the ignition again.  The BELLBOY hangs onto the
     side of the car tenaciously.

                             BELLBOY
                        Tell me.  When will the doctor be
                        awake?

                             DUKE
                          (tenses)
                        Awake?  What do you mean?

                             BELLBOY
                          (uncomfortably)
                        Well...the manager, Mr. Heem, would like
                        to <u>meet</u> him.  Nothing unusual.  Mr. Heem
                        likes to meet all our <u>large</u> accounts...
                        put them on a personal basis...just a
                        chat and a handshake, you understand.

                             DUKE
                        Of course.  But if I were you, I'd leave
                        the Doctor alone until after he's eaten
                        breakfast.  He's a very crude man.

                             BELLBOY
                        But he <u>will</u> be available?  Perhaps
                        later this morning?

                             DUKE
                        Look, I have to get going.  I have
                        to get out to the track.

                             BELLBOY
                        There's no hurry!  The race is <u>over</u>!

                             DUKE
                          (taking off)
                        Not for me.

     He WAVES, friendly-style, at the BELLBOY, and speeds around
     a turn, wheels screeching.

                             DUKE V/O
                        The weasels were closing in.
                        I could smell the ugly brutes.  Yes,
                        it was definitely time to leave.
                        My margin had shrunk to nothing.


     <u>AIRPORT</u>     EXT     DAY

     An AIRPLANE lifts off with a screech.


     <u>ON THE AIRPLANE</u>     INT     DAY

     DUKE, sunglasses on, beer in hand, looks out the window at
     the RED SHARK parked crazily in the lot below.  It recedes
     to nothing.

                             DUKE V/O
                        It would have taken extreme physical
                        force to keep me off that plane.  I was
                        so far beyond simple fatigue that I was
                        beginning to feel nicely adjusted to the
                        idea of permanent hysteria.  I felt the
                        slightest misunderstanding with the
                        stewardess would cause me to either cry
                        or go mad.  And the woman seemed to sense
                        this, because she treated me very gently.

     The STEWARDESS gently places a BLOODY MARY in front of him.

                             DUKE
                        May I...have more ice, please?

                             STEWARDESS
                        Certainly, sir.  And would you like
                        a newspaper?

                             DUKE
                        Thank you.

     He scans the front page.  WAR NEWS.  "FIVE WOUNDED NEAR NYC
     TENEMENT."  "PHARMACY OWNER ARRESTED IN PROBE."

                             DUKE V/O
                          (swallows PILLS down with the
                          Bloody Mary)
                        Reading the front page made me feel
                        a lot better.  Against that heinous
                        background, my crimes were pale and
                        meaningless.

     He puts down the PAPER, looks out the window at the DESERT
     below.

                             DUKE V/O
                        I thought about my attorney.  That
                        nightmare in the bathroom.  Just another
                        ugly refugee from the Love Generation.
                        That was the fatal flaw in Timothy
                        Leary's trip.  He crashed around America
                        selling "consciousness expansion"
                        without ever giving a thought to the
                        grim meat-hook realities that were lying
                        in wait for all the people who took him
                        too seriously.

     DUKE holds out his EMPTY GLASS to the STEWARDESS.

                             DUKE
                        Could I have another Bloody Mary,
                        please?  And...you wouldn't have any
                        cigarettes, would you?

     She smiles at him, disappears down the aisle, reappearing
     with her own PURSE.  She takes a PACK OF CIGARETTES from
     this, gives it to him.

                             DUKE V/O
                        Not that they didn't deserve it.  They
                        all Got What Was Coming To Them.  All
                        those pathetically eager acid freaks who
                        thought they could buy Peace and
                        Understanding for three dollars a hit.

     He holds out another EMPTY GLASS.

                             DUKE
                        Maybe you just better bring me
                        five, this time.

                             STEWARDESS
                        Five Bloody Marys?

                             DUKE
                        Just five vodkas.

     He looks out again at the desert.  ANGLE ON:  the
     magnificent RED MOUNTAINS seen from the air.

                             DUKE V/O
                        But what Leary took with him was the
                        central illusion of the whole lifestyle
                        that he helped to create.  That sense
                        of inevitable victory over the forces
                        of Old and Evil.  That our energy would
                        simply <u>prevail</u>.  There was no point in
                        fighting.  We were riding the crest of
                        a high and beautiful wave....
                          (pause)
                        So now, less than five years later, you
                        can go up on a steep hill in Las Vegas
                        and look West, and with the right kind
                        of eyes you can almost <u>see</u> the high-water
                        mark--that place where the wave finally
                        broke and rolled back.

     DUKE shuts his eyes.


     BLACK SCREEN

                             DUKE V/O
                        I live in a quiet place.  If I
                        hurried, I had just enough time
                        to catch the connection home.


     <u>JETWAY</u>     INT     DAY

     DUKE, the last person off the plane, walks down the jetway,
     increasingly cheerful.

     And there.  AT THE END OF THE JETWAY --

     The UNIFORMED DWARF from the Polo Lounge, aggressively
     holding out the PHONE ON A TRAY.

                             DUKE
                          (moans softly)
                        Oh, Jesus, <u>no</u>...

     He shuts his eyes in despair.

                             CAPTAIN'S VOICE
                        Folks... we got a little snag here.
                        Nothing to be alarmed about --


     <u>AIRPLANE</u>     INT     DAY

     The plane lurches alarmingly.  Warning lights come on.
     DUKE wolfs down his vodkas as the STEWARDESSES prepare for
     an EMERGENCY LANDING --

                             CAPTAIN'S VOICE
                        -- We're experiencing a little
                        mechanical difficulty.  And we'll
                        be going back the way we came.


     <u>STOCK FOOTAGE</u>

     The PAN AM JET turns in the air.

                             DUKE V/O
                        Well, I thought.  This is how the world
                        works.  All energy flows according to
                        the whims of the Great Magnet.  What
                        a fool I was to defy him.  Never cross
                        the Great Magnet.  I understood this
                        now.


     <u>AIRPLANE</u>     INT     DAY

     DUKE opens his eyes. He is still in his seat.  Everyone
     else has left the plane.  Beside him are the STEWARDESS and
     an AIRLINES CUSTOMER RELATIONS MAN holding a TELEGRAM.  They
     look at him with concern.

                             CUSTOMER RELATIONS MAN
                          (to STEWARDESS)
                        Is he okay?

                             STEWARDESS
                        He's just had a little too much to drink.
                          (shakes DUKE's arm gently)
                        Mr. Duke?  We're back in Las Vegas.
                        And you have a telegram.

     DUKE shuts his eyes again.  Opens them.  They're still
     there.

                             DUKE
                        Read it to me, would you, please?
                        My eyes aren't too good this time of day.

     The MAN and STEWARDESS exchange looks.  She reads.

                             STEWARDESS

                        It's signed "Doctor Gonzo."

                             DUKE
                          (mutters)
                        Holy shit.


     <u>AIRPLANE DOOR</u>     EXT     AFTERNOON

     DUKE stands in the doorway, beer in hand.
     Sweating horribly, he looks down at LAS VEGAS AIRPORT.
     He begins his descent.

                             DUKE V/O
                        I tend to sweat heavily in warm
                        climates.  My clothes are soaking
                        wet from dawn to dusk --


     <u>DOCTOR'S OFFICE</u>     INT     DAY

     A DOCTOR examines DUKE.

                             DUKE V/O
                        This worried me at first, but then I went
                        to a doctor and described my normal daily
                        intake of booze, drugs and poison --

                             DUKE
                        Two or three sixpacks of beer, quart of
                        Chivas, handful of reds, couple of
                        joints, oh, I don't know, varying amount
                        of coke, 1/2 pound steak, rare --

                             DOCTOR
                        Come back when the sweating stops.
                        That's the danger point.

                             DUKE V/O
                        A sign, he said, that my body's
                        dangerously overworked flushing
                        mechanism had broken down completely.

                             DOCTOR
                        I have great faith in the natural
                        processes.  But in your case...well...I
                        find no precedent.  We'll just have to
                        wait and see, then work with what's left.


     <u>LAS VEGAS AIRPORT BAR</u>     INT     AFTERNOON

     The COCKTAIL WAITRESS brings two Bloody Marys.

                             DUKE
                        Made with V-8 juice, right?  I need the
                        nutritional content.  That's right.
                        I'm here to cover the Drug Conference.
                        Haven't eaten anything but grapefruit
                        for about twenty hours.  There <u>are</u> limits
                        to what the human body can endure.

     The COCKTAIL WAITRESS backs away from him.  Goes to the bar.
     She and the BARTENDER murmur, watch him.  DUKE flashes them
     a BOGART SMILE.

                             DUKE V/O
                        You better watch yourself, I thought.
                        You don't want to break down and start
                        bleeding from the ears right here in the
                        terminal.  Not in this town.

     The BARTENDER and COCKTAIL WAITRESS turn away.  DUKE
     scrabbles through his leather carry-on for the DRUG KIT BAG.

                             DUKE V/O
                        Luckily, nobody bothered me while I
                        ran a quick inventory.  The stash was
                        a hopeless mess, all churned together
                        and half-crushed.  Some of the mescaline
                        pellets had disintegrated into a reddish
                        brown powder...
                          (licks powder from his fingers)
                        ...but I counted about thirty-five or
                        forty still intact.  My attorney had
                        eaten all the reds, but there was quite
                        a bit of speed left... one acid blotter.
                        a nice brown lump of opium hash, six
                        loose amyls... Not enough for
                        anything serious, but a careful rationing
                        of the mescaline would probably get us
                        through the four-day Drug Conference.

     DUKE gestures to the WAITRESS, who ignores him.  He shrugs
     and leaves.

                             DUKE V/O
                        No sign of my attorney.  I decided
                        to take my chances on my own.


     <u>VIP CAR RENTAL BOOTH</u>     EXT     AFTERNOON

     The AGENT sits in the glass booth reading a MICKEY SPILLANE
     NOVEL.  DUKE cruises up in the RED SHARK, honks the horn.
     The AGENT jumps, hurries outside.

                             AGENT
                        Yessir!

                             DUKE
                        This goddamn Chevy has caused me a lot
                        of trouble.  I get the feeling that
                        people are putting me down--especially
                        in gas stations. when I have to get out
                        and open the hood <u>manually</u>...

                             AGENT
                          (brightly)
                        Well...of <u>course</u>.  What you need is
                        one of our Mercedes 600 Towne-Cruiser
                        Specials, with air-conditioning.  You
                        can even carry your own fuel, if you
                        want, we make that available....

                             DUKE
                        Do I look like a goddamn Nazi?  I'll
                        have a natural <u>American</u> car, or
                        nothing at all!


     <u>SAME</u>     A FEW MOMENTS LATER

     DUKE and AGENT in same spots, only now DUKE sits in a WHITE
     CADILLAC COUPE DE VILLE -- the WHITE WHALE.

     The AGENT fills out the credit slip with DUKE's credit card
     number, while DUKE, punching the buttons on the dash, makes
     every inch of the automated car jump.

                             DUKE V/O
                        They called up the white Coupe de Ville
                        at once.  Ten grand worth of gimmicks
                        and high-priced Special Effects.  The
                        dashboard was full of esoteric lights
                        and dials and meters that I would never
                        understand...

     He signs the CREDIT SLIP and pulls out, the AGENT beaming.

     The AGENT goes into the booth.  Routine phone credit check.


     <u>THE WHITE WHALE</u>     EXT     DUSK

     As DUKE drives away, the AGENT, freaked at what he's heard
     on the phone, races after him.  Too late.

                             DUKE V/O
                        But there was no doubt in my mind
                        that I was in a <u>superior</u> machine...

     Behind him, the AGENT waves his arms, races through traffic
     after, until, exhausted, he must fall back.

     DUKE drives on.


     <u>FLAMINGO HOTEL</u>     EXT     NIGHT

     A GIANT SIGN:  THE FLAMINGO WELCOMES DISTRICT ATTORNEYS DRUG
     CONFERENCE 1971.

     The WHITE WHALE turns into a VIP PARKING SLOT, immediately
     attended by impressed MINIONS.

                             DUKE V/O
                        I drove straight to the hotel.  Still
                        no sign of my attorney.  I decided to
                        check in on my own--if only to get off
                        the street and avoid a public breakdown.

     A mangy, bleary-eyed, on-the-edge DUKE gets out of the car.
     pops another pill, takes a swig of his beer, and heads for
     the lobby.


     <u>FLAMINGO HOTEL LOBBY</u>     INT     NIGHT

     A nightmare.  About a HUNDRED COP TYPES on vacation, all
     dressed almost exactly alike in plaid bermuda shorts, Arnold
     Palmer golf shirts, and rubberized beach sandals.

     DUKE enters, forces himself to remain calm, heads for the
     check-in line.

                             DUKE V/O
                        The place was full of cops.  I saw this
                        at a glance.  It was a terrifying scene
                        to walk into--a super stakeout of some
                        kind.  If I hadn't known about the
                        conference, my mind might have snapped.

     He turns to joke with the DISTRICT ATTORNEY behind him.
     Waves at the lobby.

                             DUKE
                        You get the impression somebody's going
                        to be gunned down in a blazing crossfire
                        at any moment?
                          (DA stares stonily ahead)
                        Like, maybe, the entire Manson family?

     Still no response.  DUKE shrugs, turns away.

     AHEAD OF HIM -- A POLICE CHIEF argues with the DESK CLERK.
     The POLICE CHIEF'S WIFE stands to the side, weeping.  The
     POLICE CHIEF'S FRIENDS stand uneasily around.

                             POLICE CHIEF
                        What do you <u>mean</u> I'm too late to
                        register?  I'm a <u>police</u> <u>chief</u>.  From
                        <u>Michigan</u>.  Look, fella.  I <u>told</u> you.
                          (waves a POSTCARD)
                        I have a postcard here that says I have
                        <u>reservations</u> in this hotel.  Hell, I'm
                        with the District Attorneys' Conference!
                        I've already <u>paid</u> for my room!

                             CLERK
                          (prissily)
                        I'm sorry, sir.  You're on the 'late
                        list'.  Your reservations were
                        transferred to the...ah...Moonlight
                        Motel, which is out on Paradise Boulevard
                        and actually a very fine place of lodging
                        and only sixteen blocks from here, with
                        its own pool and...

     The POLICE CHIEF'S WIFE gives a WAIL OF GRIEF.

                             POLICE CHIEF
                        You dirty little faggot!  Call the
                        manager!  I'm tired of listening to
                        this dogshit!

                             CLERK
                          (solicitously)
                        I'm so sorry, sir.  May I call you a cab?

     DUKE catches the CLERK'S EYE.  The CLERK WINKS.

                             DUKE V/O
                        Of course.  I could hear what the Clerk
                        was really saying--

     As the POLICE CHIEF screams insults, the CLERK gives his
     speech as in DUKE'S IMAGINATION.

                             CLERK
                          (to POLICE CHIEF)
                        Listen, you fuzzy little shithead--
                        I've been fucked around, in my time, by
                        a fairly good cross-section of mean-
                        tempered rule-crazy cops and now it's
                        MY turn.  It doesn't matter who's right
                        or wrong, man...what matters is that for
                        the first time in my life I can say:
                        "Fuck you, <u>officer</u>, I'm in charge here,
                        and I'm telling you we don't have room
                        for you."

     The CLERK'S EYES glitter malevolently.
     DUKE steps to the desk, around the raging POLICE CHIEF.

                             DUKE
                        Say.  I hate to interrupt, but I have a
                        reservation and I wonder if maybe I could
                        just sort of slide through and get out of
                        your way.

     He put his CREDIT CARD down.  EVERYONE goes silent.  The
     POLICE CHIEF GROUP stares at him in horror.  His old Levis.
     His dirty basketball sneakers.  His Acapulco shirt torn
     apart by road-wind.  His three day beard growth.  His mirror
     shades.

     The CLERK smiles broadly, hits the bell for the BELLBOY.

                             CLERK
                        Raoul Duke.  Certainly, sir!  And
                        your bags?

                             DUKE
                        Out there in that white Cadillac
                        convertible.  Can you have someone
                        drive it around to the room?

     ALL EYES swivel toward the gleaming WHITE WHALE.

                             DUKE
                        Oh, and could I get a quart of
                        Wild Turkey, two fifths of Bacardi,
                        and a night's worth of ice delivered
                        to my room, please?

                             CLERK
                          (nods)
                        Don't worry about a thing, sir.  Just
                        enjoy your stay.  Oh, and there's a
                        message for you, sir.  Somebody named
                        Innes.  He'll call later about the ape.

                             DUKE
                        Thank you.

     The POLICE CHIEF CROWD stare at him in shock as he waits by
     the ELEVATOR.  He stares back at them.

                             DUKE V/O
                        My presence was an outrage.  I <u>was</u>
                        the Menace.  A stone obvious drug
                        abuser.  And I intended to push
                        it all the way to the limit.

     DUKE gives a loud SNUFFLE, wipes his nose with his fingers,
     hauls another BEER out and opens it.

                             DUKE V/O
                        It was a matter of life-style, of
                        obligation--even duty.  If the Pigs
                        were gathered in Vegas for a top-level
                        Drug Conference, I felt the drug culture
                        should be represented.

     The POLICE CHIEF, furious, is restrained by his FRIENDS.
     DUKE gives them a friendly wave with the beer can.
     disappears into the elevator.


     <u>HOTEL FLAMINGO UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR</u>     INT     NIGHT

     DUKE stumbles from the elevator, laughing, heads for his
     room.

                             DUKE V/O
                        My idea was to get into the room.
                        smoke my last big chunk of Singapore
                        Grey while watching Walter Cronkite.
                        I needed this break, this moment of
                        peace and refuge, before I did the
                        Drug Conference.

                             DUKE
                          (sags with relief; fits the
                          key into the lock)
                        Ah, home at last!

     He swings the door open.  IT HITS SOMETHING WITH A SICKENING
     THUD.

                             DUKE V/O
                        Somehow I knew I had the right room...


     <u>HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE</u>     INT     NIGHT

     DUKE enters.  The door has hit a sixteen year old GIRL with
     the aura of an angry Pit Bull.

     With a curse, he throws his satchel on the bed and turns.
     DR. GONZO, huge and naked, stands grinning in front of a ten
     foot MIRROR.

                             DUKE
                          (moving toward him)
                        Hey, buddy, how are you <u>doing</u>?

                             DR. GONZO
                        Just great, old friend.  Yourself?

                             DUKE
                        Just fine.
                          (lowers his voice)
                        You degenerate pig.  What is she?
                        Sixteen?

                             DR. GONZO
                        This is Lucy.  You know--like Lucy
                        in the sky with diamonds.

     LUCY eyes DUKE, like a wild beast.  A GROWLING NOISE comes
     from her throat.  She makes ready to pounce.

                             DR. GONZO
                        Lucy!  Be cool, goddamnit!
                        Remember what happened in the lobby!
                        No more of that, okay?

     She growls again.  DR. GONZO takes her by the arm.

                             DR. GONZO
                        Lucy...this is my <u>client</u>, Mr. Duke,
                        the famous journalist.  He's <u>paying</u>
                        for this suite, Lucy.  He's on <u>our</u>
                        side.

     She still growls.  DUKE's hand reaches for the MACE.

                             DR. GONZO
                        NO!  NOT HERE!  WE'LL HAVE
                        TO MOVE OUT!

     GONZO leads LUCY away, coaxing gently.

                             DR. GONZO
                        Mr. Duke is my <u>friend</u>.  He loves
                        artists.  Let's show him your paintings.

     Still holding the MACE, DUKE follows them to a DOZEN
     CANVASES, lined up with their backs to us.

                             DR. GONZO
                        Lucy paints portraits of Barbra
                        Streisand, don't you, Lucy?

                             LUCY
                        I drew these from TV.

                             DUKE
                        Fantastic.
                          (grabs GONZO)
                        Can we talk?

     He drags him toward the PATIO.

                             LUCY
                          (makes one-fingered Jesus freak sign)
                        God bless.


     <u>SUITE PATIO</u>     EXT     NIGHT

     While they talk, they do DRUGS:  a hit of coke from an
     almost-empty salt-shaker, a roach, a couple of amyls.

                             DUKE
                        Are you insane? This girl is a
                        walking bomb.  Ever heard of the
                        Mann Act?  They'll hang you for
                        Rape and Consensual Sodomy!

                             DR. GONZO
                        No!  I felt <u>sorry</u> for the girl!  I
                        wanted to <u>help</u> her! Jesus, she's a
                        religious freak!  She's running away
                        from home for something like the fifth
                        time in six months.  I gave her some of
                        the acid I had stashed, and--

                             DUKE
                        You stupid bastard.  Just picture
                        yourself telling a jury that you
                        tried to help this poor girl by
                        giving her LSD and then one of your
                        special stark naked back rubs.

                             DR. GONZO
                        You're right.  They'd probably burn
                        me at the goddamn stake.
                          (shakes his head sadly)
                        Shit, it doesn't pay to try to help
                        somebody these days.

                             DUKE
                        Well.  It'll probably work out.  We
                        can keep her loaded and peddle her
                        ass at the drug convention.

     THROUGH THE GLASS - LUCY is intent on another SKETCH OF
     BARBRA

                             DUKE
                        She's perfect for this gig.  The cops
                        will go fifty bucks a head to beat her
                        into submission and then gang-fuck her.
                        We can set her up in one of these
                        back-street motels, hang pictures of
                        Jesus all over the room, then turn
                        these pigs loose on her....Hell, she's
                        strong, she'll hold her own.

                             DR. GONZO
                          (aghast)
                        Jesus Christ, I knew you were sick,
                        but I never expected to hear you
                        actually <u>say</u> that kind of stuff.

                             DUKE
                        It's straight economics.  This girl
                        is a <u>godsend</u>.

     DUKE points at the WHITE WHALE in the parking lot.

                             DUKE
                        There it is.  Not a bad-looking
                        car for a pimp.

                             DR. GONZO
                        Okay, okay.  You're right.  We
                        have to cut her loose.  How about
                        this.  We give her some money,
                        get her another hotel room on the
                        other side of town.  She's so stoned,
                        she won't remember a thing--

                             DUKE
                        Maybe we should take it easy tonight.

                             DR. GONZO
                        Right.  Let's find a good seafood
                        restaurant and eat some red salmon.
                        I feel a powerful lust for red salmon...


     <u>HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE</u>     INT     NIGHT

     GONZO and DUKE enter, as LUCY proudly holds up her sketch.

                             DR. GONZO
                          (as DUKE gathers up PORTRAITS)
                        Okay, Lucy, it's time to go meet
                        Barbra...

                             DUKE V/O
                        I felt like a Nazi, but it had to
                        be done.  Lucy was not <u>right</u> for us--
                        not in this fragile situation.

     As GONZO hustles LUCY out of the room, DUKE uses the PHONE.

                             DUKE
                        Hotel Americana?  I need a reservation.
                        For my niece.  Listen, I need her
                        treated very gently.  She's an artist.
                        and might seem a trifle high-strung...


     <u>ON THE STREETS, A CAB STAND</u>     EXT     NIGHT

     The WHITE WHALE pulls up, with DUKE at the wheel.
     GONZO helps LUCY from the car into a CAB.

                             DUKE V/O
                        There was absolutely no choice but
                        to cut her adrift and hope her memory
                        was fucked.

     GONZO gets back in the car.

                        DR. GONZO
                        Take off slowly.  Don't attract
                        attention.


     <u>WHITE WHALE</u>     INT     NIGHT

     They pullout into traffic.  A balmy desert night.

                             DR. GONZO
                        I gave the cabbie an extra five bucks
                        to make sure she gets there safe.
                        Also, I told him I'd be there myself
                        in an hour, and if she wasn't, I'd
                        come back out here and rip his lungs out.

                             DUKE
                        That's good, You can't be subtle
                        in this town.

                             DR. GONZO
                        As your attorney, I advise you to tell
                        me where you put the goddamn mescaline.

     DUKE produces the KIT BAG.  They swallow pellets down.
     The STARS come up in the sky.  They glide through the
     streets.


     <u>HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE</u>     INT     NIGHT

     RETCHING SOUNDS come from the bathroom.  DUKE turns on the
     TV.  1971 COMMERCIALS fill the screen.

                             DR. GONZO
                          (from bathroom)
                        This goddamn mescaline.  Why the fuck
                        can't they make it less pure?  Cut it
                        with Rolaids, or something.

     DUKE notices the PHONE MESSAGE LIGHT blinking.  Opens
     another beer, picks up the phone.

                             DUKE
                          (to PHONE)
                        My light's blinking.  You have

                        WHAT?

                             CLERK'S VOICE
                        ...Lucy, at the Americana...

                             DUKE
                        Holy shit.
                          (hangs up; GONZO looks at him)
                        <u>Lucy</u> called.  Room 1600.
                        What I want to know is -- why
                        was the message for <u>me</u>?  Why isn't
                        she looking for <u>you</u>?

                             DR. GONZO
                          (shrugs)
                        She really flipped over you.  The only
                        way I could get rid of her was by saying
                        you were taking me out to the desert for
                        a showdown--that you wanted me out of
                        the way so you could have her all to
                        yourself.  Shit, I had to tell her
                        <u>something</u>.  I told her to go to the
                        Americana and wait and see which one
                        of us came back.
                          (laughs)
                        I guess she figures you won.

     DUKE stares at him, aghast.  The PHONE jangles.

                          (quietly; to PHONE)
                        Tell me.  What do you <u>want</u>?

                             CLERK'S VOICE
                        I thought I should tell you...
                        because I know you're with the
                        Police Convention...that the woman
                        who left that message for you
                        sounded <u>very</u> <u>disturbed</u>.  Since I

                          (downs a quick CHIVAS REGAL)
                        I know.  Look, you want to be very
                        gentle with that woman.  She's our

     <u>HOTEL FLAMINGO FRONT DESK</u>     INT     NIGHT

     Bemused, the CLERK hangs up the phone.


     <u>HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE</u>     INT     NIGHT

     DUKE throws things in his leather case.  GONZO fervently
     flicks channels on the TV.  Still only COMMERCIALS.

                             DR. GONZO
                        Good work.  They'll treat us
                        like goddamn lepers after that.
                        What are you doing?
                          (no answer)
                        Jesus, you're not <u>leaving</u>7

                             DUKE
                        You're goddamn right, I'm leaving.
                        Look.  I have nothing personal against
                        Lucy.  I'm sure she's very sensitive
                        with a secret reserve of karma
                        underneath her Pit Bull act...and
                        not only is she stone crazy, but also
                        perfectly capable of SENDING US BOTH
                        TO PRISON FOR AT LEAST TWENTY YEARS.
                          (picks up his bag)
                        There is no other way to cope with it.
                        It is extremely important to get out
                        of town immediately.

                             DR. GONZO
                          (shouts)
                        WAIT!  You can't leave me alone in this
                        snake pit!  The room is in my <u>name</u>!
                          (DUKE heads for the door)
                        OK, goddamnit!  <u>I'll</u> call her!  I'll get
                        her off our backs.  You're right.  She's
                        my problem.

                             DUKE
                        No, it's gone too far.

                             DR. GONZO
                        You'd make a piss-poor lawyer.  Relax.
                        Let me handle this.
                          (dials the PHONE)
                        Where's that opium?

                             DUKE
                          (tossing him the KIT BAG)
                        Be careful.  There's not much left.

                             DR. GONZO
                          (to PHONE)
                        Room 1600, please.
                        As your attorney, I advise you not to
                        worry.
                          (nods toward bathroom)
                        Take a hit out of that little brown
                        bottle in my shaving kit.

     DUKE goes in the bathroom, takes out the bottle.

                             DUKE
                        What is it?

                             DR. GONZO
                        Adrenochrome.  You won't need much.
                        Just a tiny taste.  That stuff makes
                        pure mescaline seem like ginger beer.
                          (to PHONE)
                        Hi, Lucy?  Yeah, it's me.  I got your
                        message...what?  Hell, no, I taught the
                        bastard a lesson he'll never forget...
                        what?  No, not dead, but he won't be
                        bothering anybody for awhile.  Yeah.
                        I left him out there, stomped him,
                        pulled all his teeth out...

                             DUKE V/O
                        Jesus, I thought.  What a terrible
                        thing to lay on somebody with a head
                        full of acid.

     In the bathroom, DUKE dips a match head into the brown
     bottle.  He holds it up to the light.  Studies it.  Wonders
     what it does.  No idea.  He decides to find out.

                             DR. GONZO
                          (to PHONE)
                        But here's the problem.  I have to leave
                        here right away.  That bastard cashed a
                        bad check downstairs and gave <u>you</u> as a
                        reference, so they'll be looking for both
                        of you.  The last thing you want to do is
                        call this hotel again: they'll trace the
                        call and put you straight behind bars...
                        no, I'm moving to the Tropicana, I'll
                        call you when I know my room number,
                        sure, as soon as I check in...what?
                        Of course.  We'll go to Circus Circus,
                        catch the polar bear act...no, listen,
                        I have to go, they've got the phone
                        tapped...O MY GOD!  THEY'RE KICKING THE
                        DOOR OOWN!

     DR. GONZO throws the PHONE down, shouts.

                             DR. GONZO
                        No!  Get away!  I'm innocent!  It was
                        Duke!  I swear to God!
                          (stomps the PHONE; moans)
                        You'll never catch Lucy!  She's gone!
                        I swear, I don't know where she is!
                        DON'T PUT THAT THING ON ME!
                          (slams the PHONE down)
                        Well.  That's that.  She's probably
                        stuffing herself down the incinerator
                        about now.  That's the last we should
                        be hearing from Lucy.

     DUKE emerges from the bathroom.  VEINS stand out on his
     forehead.  He is purplish-red.  OVER THE TOP.  Too late, he
     realizes he is NEAR DEATH.

                             DR. GONZO
                        Goddamnit!  You took too <u>much</u>!
                        You're about to explode!  Jesus,
                        look at your <u>face</u>!

                             DUKE
                          (croaks)
                        Can't move.  Maybe if I...took
                        a swim...

                             DR. GONZO
                        If I put you in the pool right now,
                        you'd sink like a stone.  The first
                        rush is the worst.  Don't try and fight
                        it, or you'll get brain bubbles.
                        Strokes, aneurisms.  You'll just wither
                        up and die.

     DUKE falls to the ground, writhing, catatonic, sinking into
     paralysis.

                             DR. GONZO'S VOICE
                        Die...die...die...

     BLACK SCREEN

     And the sound, and then the HIDEOUS FACE and VOICE OF
     RICHARD NIXON.

                             NIXON
                        Sacrifice...sacrifice...sacrifice...


     <u>SAME</u>     AN HOUR LATER

     DUKE manages to flop his near-paralyzed body over.
     GONZO watches NIXON on the late night news.  He sees
     DUKE attempt to struggle to his feet.

                             DR. GONZO
                        There's only one place we can get
                        fresh salmon.  I checked while you were
                        on the floor.

                             DUKE
                          (croaks)
                        Where did you get...this stuff?

                             DR. GONZO
                        The adrenochrome?  Only one source
                        for that stuff--

                             DUKE
                        The adrenaline glands...from a <u>living</u>
                        human body--

                             DR. GONZO
                        Monster client of mine.  A Satanism
                        freak.  No cash.  He offered me this
                        instead.  Told me it would make me
                        higher than I'd ever been in my life.
                          (laughs)
                        I thought he was kidding.  They'd
                        nailed the guy for child molesting.
                        He swore he didn't do it.  "Why should
                        I fuck with <u>children</u>?" he says.  "They're
                        too <u>small</u>."
                          (shrugs)
                        What could I say?  Even a goddamn
                        werewolf is entitled to legal counsel.
                        I didn't dare turn the creep down.
                        He might have picked up a letter opener
                        and gone after my pineal gland.

                             DUKE
                        We should get some of that.  Pineal
                        gland.  Just eat a big handful.

                             DR. GONZO
                        That's a <u>good</u> idea.  One <u>whiff</u> of that
                        shit would turn you into something out
                        of a goddamn medical encyclopedia.
                        Man, your head would swell up like a
                        watermelon, you'd probably gain about a
                        hundred pounds in two hours...claws,
                        bleeding warts, then you'd notice about
                        six huge hairy tits swelling up on
                        your back...
                          (pause)
                        You want to go out to get that salmon,
                        or what?

                             DUKE
                          (croaks)
                        Yeah.  Sure.

     HE PITCHES HEAD FIRST ONTO THE BED.

     BLACK SCREEN

                             LOUDSPEAKER VOICE
                          (crackling and booming)
                        On behalf of the prosecuting attorneys
                        of this country, I welcome you--


     <u>HOTEL BALLROOM</u>     INT     DAY

     A BIG CROWD.  Both the COP CREAM OF MIDDLE AMERICA, and a
     GOOD CONTINGENT OF UNDERCOVER NARCS.  So cops dressed like
     assistant football coaches next to cops with beards,
     mustaches, super-mod dress.

     A BANNER behind the PODIUM reads:  NATIONAL DA'S CONVENTION.
     APRIL 25-29, 1971.  "If You Don't Know, Come To Learn...If
     You Know, Come To Teach."

     A dozen big, low-fidelity SPEAKERS mounted on STEEL POLES
     distort and feed back the SPEAKER'S VOICE through the room.

     In the rear fringes of the crowd, under a LOUDSPEAKER, sits
     DUKE--clad in black FBI wingtip shoes, a Pat Boone madras
     sportcoat, and an OFFICIAL NAME TAG:  <u>RAOUL DUKE, PRIVATE</u>
     <u>INVESTIGATOR, L.A.</u>

     Next to him, DR. GONZO wears a double-breasted blue
     pinstripe suit.  His NAMETAG:  <u>DR. GONZO, EXPERT, CRIMINAL</u>
     <u>DRUG ANALYSIS.</u>

     Both men wear SUNGLASSES.

                             DR. GONZO
                        This is a fucking <u>nightmare</u>.  Here I
                        am infiltrating a goddamn Pig conference,
                        but sure as hell there's some dope-
                        dealing bomb freak in this town who's
                        going to recognize me and put the word
                        out that I'm out here partying with a
                        thousand <u>cops</u>.

                             DUKE
                        They're actually nice people.  Once you
                        get to know them.

                             DR. GONZO
                        <u>Know</u> <u>them</u>?  Are you kidding?  Man, I know
                        these people in my goddamn <u>blood</u>!

     The COPS stir restlessly around them.

                             DUKE
                        Don't mention that word around here.
                        You'll get them excited.

                             DR. GONZO
                          (lowers his voice)
                        You're right.  I saw these bastards
                        in <u>Easy</u> <u>Rider</u>, but I didn't believe
                        they were real.

     Taking FOUR MESCALINE PELLETS from his pocket, he passes two
     to DUKE under cover of a CONFERENCE PROGRAM.  Both men
     cough, put hands to their mouths, swallow.

                             DR. GONZO
                        Cheers.

                             LOUDSPEAKER VOICE
                        We must come to terms with the Drug
                        Culture, and to help us do that.
                        today we have--

                             DUKE
                        We should have done this on acid.

                             DR. GONZO
                        Lucky I brought some...

                             COP IN BACK
                        SSSSHHHHH!

                             LOUDSPEAKER VOICE
                        Dr. E.R. Bloomquist, author of the
                        paperback book, <u>Marijuana</u>, which, as
                        those of us who've read know, really
                        tells it like it is--

     ON THE PODIUM - The SPEAKER introduces DR. BLOOMQUIST, who
     wears black wingtip shoes and a Pat Boone Madras sportcoat.

                             LOUDSPEAKER VOICE
                        Dr. Bloomquist.

     POLITE APPLAUSE.

                             DR. BLOOMQUIST
                        Now, there are four states of being in
                        the cannabis, or marijuana, society:
                        Cool, Groovy, Hip, and Square.  The
                        square is seldom if ever cool.  He is
                        not "with it," that is, he doesn't know
                        "what's happening."  But if he manages
                        to figure it out, he moves up a notch
                        to "hip."

                             DUKE
                        We need that acid now.

                             DR. GONZO
                          (passing it to him)
                        No shit.

     Both cough again and swallow the blue barrels down.

                             DR. BLOOMQUIST
                        And if he can bring himself to approve
                        of what is happening, he becomes
                        "groovy."  After that, with much luck and
                        perseverance, he can rise to the rank of
                        "cool."  A "cool guy," as he's then
                        called, will use the slang of the Drug
                        Culture.  He will call the reefer
                        butt a "roach," because it resembles
                        a cockroach.  He will call sunglasses
                        "tea shades."

                             DR. GONZO
                          (whispers)
                        What the fuck are these people talking
                        about?  You'd have to be crazy on acid
                        to think a joint looked like a goddamn
                        cockroach!

     DUKE shrugs.

                             DR. GONZO
                        I'll be down in the casino.  I know a
                        hell of a lot better ways to waste my
                        time than listening to <u>this</u> bullshit.

     He stands, knocking the ASHTRAY off his chair arm, and
     plunges down the aisle to the door.

                             COP IN BACK
                        Down in front!

                             DR. GONZO
                        Fuck you!

     He stumbles from the room.  DUKE turns his attention back to
     DR. BLOOMQUIST...

                             DUKE V/O
                        It was clear we'd stumbled into
                        a prehistoric gathering.

                             DR. BLOOMQUIST
                        ...about these LSD flashbacks, the
                        patient never knows: he thinks it's
                        all over and he gets himself straightened
                        out for SlX months, and then, darn it.
                        the whole trip comes back on him.

                             DUKE V/O
                        This is dangerous gibberish.  The kind
                        that used to be posted, in the form of
                        mimeographed bulletins, in Police
                        Department locker rooms...

     The LIGHTS go down.  A SPOTLIGHT on DR. BLOOMQUIST.  A SLIDE
     SHOW behind him illustrates his now evangelical talk.

                             DR. BLOOMQUIST
                        KNOW YOUR DOPE FIEND!  YOUR LIFE MAY
                        DEPEND ON IT!

     A SLIDE of a DOPE FIEND appears, looking remarkably like
     DR. GONZO.

                             DR. BLOOMQUIST
                        You will not be able to see his eyes
                        because of Tea-Shades, but his knuckles
                        will be white from inner tension and
                        his pants will be crusted with semen
                        from constantly jacking off when he
                        can't find a rape victim.  He will
                        stagger and babble when questioned.  He
                        will not respect your badge.  The Dope
                        Fiend fears nothing.  He will attack, for
                        no reason, with every weapon at his
                        command--including yours.  BEWARE.  Any
                        officer apprehending a suspected
                        marijuana addict should use all necessary
                        force immediately.  One stitch in time
                        (on him) will usually save nine on you.
                        Good luck.

     The AUDIENCE jumps to its feet, CHEERING LOUDLY.  LIGHTS up.

     DUKE looks around him.  THE ROOM HAS RETURNED TO NORMAL.
     The COP next to him sleeps, snoring loudly.  DR. BLOQMQUIST
     continues to drone on onstage.

     A MOD COP dressed like Superfly raises his hand.  Behind
     him, the ranting POLICE CHIEF from the lobby necks with his
     WIFE.

                             MOD COP
                        Do you think, Dr., that the strange
                        behavior recently of the anthropologist
                        Margaret Mead can be explained by a
                        private marijuana addiction?

     DUKE leaps up and flees toward the door.

                             DUKE
                          (muttering apologies)
                        Pardon me, I feel sick.  Beg pardon,
                        yes, feeling sick...

     A PATH opens.  He makes it to the door fast.  As he goes--

                             DR. BLOOMQUIST
                        I really don't know.  But at her
                        age, if she did smoke grass, she'd
                        have one hell of a trip.

     BEHIND DUKE - The AUDIENCE roars with laughter.


     <u>FLAMINGO HOTEL BAR</u>     INT     DAY

     A TV on behind the bar with the sound off.  The NEWS.

                             DUKE
                          (to BARTENDER)
                        Tall rum with ice.
                          (points to TV)
                        Sports on yet?

                             BARTENDER
                          (pours the drink)
                        Any second.

     He turns up the volume.  DUKE drinks, watches.

                             TV NEWSCASTER
                          (on TV)
                        ...was arrested walking nude through the
                        neighborhood where he lived.  Police said
                        he had taken an overdose of PCP, an
                        animal tranquilizer manufactured by
                        Parke-Davis.  Charles told a jailer that
                        his eyes were bothering him and that he
                        could not read.  Police said Charles
                        seemed to be in a deeply depressed state
                        and so impervious to pain that he did not
                        scream when he pulled out his own eyes...

     DUKE lunges across the bar and CHANGES THE CHANNEL.
     A FOOTBALL COACH being interviewed.

                             FOOTBALL COACH
                          (on TV)
                        ...this rookie Fire has definite
                        promise.  Yesterday, before practice.
                        he destroyed a Greyhound Bus with his
                        bare hands, and last night he killed
                        a subway.  He's a natural for color TV...

                             MAN'S VOICE
                        I'm a whiskey man. myself. We don't have
                        much problem from drugs down where I come
                        from.

     DUKE turns and sees DR. GONZO deep in conversation with TWO
     GOOD OLD BOYS, whose name tags identify them as DISTRICT
     ATTORNEYS FROM GEORGIA.  The BARTENDER eavesdrops on their
     conversation.

     At that end of the bar, a LOUNGE BAND plays a medley of
     anti-war songs.

                             DR. GONZO
                          (as DUKE joins them)
                        You will.  One of these nights you'll
                        wake up and find a junkie tearing your
                        bedroom apart.

                             DA #1

                          (to BARTENDER)

                        You're another one of these California
                        boys.  Your friend here's been tellin'
                        us about dope fiends.

                             DUKE
                        They're everywhere.  Nobody's safe.
                        And sure as hell not in the South.
                        They like warm weather.

                             DR. GONZO
                        They work in pairs.  Sometimes in
                        gangs.  They'll climb right into your
                        bedroom and sit on your chest with
                        big Bowie knives.  On your WIFE'S chest.
                        Put the blade right down her throat.

                             DR. GONZO
                        You'd never believe it.  In L.A., it's
                        out of control.  First it was drugs,
                        now it's witchcraft.

                        trouble until you have to face down a
                        bunch of these addicts gone crazy for
                        human sacrifice!

                        Naw!  That's science fiction stuff!

                             DR. GONZO
                        Not where <u>we</u> operate.  Hell, in Malibu
                        alone, these goddamn Satan worshippers
                        kill six or eight people <u>every</u> <u>day</u>.

                             DA #2
                        O my god!  That's horrible!

                             DR. GONZO
                        They chop off their heads and drink
                        their blood.  Whole families.  During
                        the night.  Most of them don't even
                        wake up until they feel their heads
                        going--and then, of course, it's
                        too late.

     The BARTENDER, agitated, leans toward them.

                             DUKE
                        Four more rums.  Plenty of ice.  Maybe
                        a handful of lime chunks.

                             BARTENDER
                        Are you guys with the police convention
                        upstairs?

                             DA #1
                          (with a big smile)
                        We sure are, my friend.

                             BARTENDER
                        I thought so.  I never heard that kind
                        of talk at this bar before.  Jesus
                        Christ!  How do you guys <u>stand</u> that kind
                        of work?

                             DR. GONZO
                          (grinning)
                        We <u>like</u> it.  It's groovy.

     The BARTENDER stares at them, his face frozen with
     repugnance.

                             DUKE
                        What's wrong with you?  Hell,
                        <u>somebody</u> has to do it.

                             DR. GONZO
                        Hurry up with those drinks.  We're
                        thirsty.  Only three rums.  Make mine
                        a Bloody Mary.

                             DA #1
                        Hell, I really hate to hear this.
                        Because everything that happens in
                        California seems to get down our way,
                        sooner or later--

                             DUKE
                        Hell, yes.  Just the other day we had a
                        case where they grabbed a girl right off
                        the street, out of a McDonald's hamburger
                        stand.

                             DA #1
                          (very agitated)
                        What happened?

                             DR. GONZO
                        <u>Do</u>?  Jesus Christ man.  They chopped
                        her goddamn head off right there in the
                        parking lot.  Cut all kinds of holes in
                        her and sucked out the blood.

                             DA #2
                        God <u>almighty!</u>  And nobody <u>did</u> anything?

                             DUKE
                        What <u>could</u> they do?  The guy that took
                        the head was about six-seven and maybe
                        three hundred pounds.  He was packing
                        two Lugers, and the other had M-16s.
                        They were all veterans.

                             DR. GONZO
                        He used to be a major in the Marines.
                        We know where he lives, but we can't
                        get near the house.

     DA #2 whacks his fist on the bar.

                             DA #2
                        But we can't just lock ourselves in the
                        house and be prisoners!  We don't even
                        know who these people are!  How do you
                        <u>recognize</u> them?

                             DR. GONZO
                        You can't.  The only way to do it
                        is to go to the mat with this scum.

                             DA #1
                        What do you mean by that?

                             DR. GONZO
                        You <u>know</u> what I mean.

                             DUKE
                        Cut their goddamn heads off.  Every one
                        of them.  That's what we're doing in
                        California.

                             DA #1
                        WHAT?

                             DR. GONZO
                        Sure.  It's all on the Q.T., but
                        everybody who <u>matters</u> is with us all
                        the way down the line.

                             DA #2
                        God!  I had no idea it was so bad
                        out there!

                             DUKE
                        We keep it quiet.  It's not the kind of
                        thing you'd want to talk about upstairs.
                        Not with the press around.

                             DA #1
                        Hell, no.  We'd never hear the goddamn
                        end of it.

                             DUKE
                        Dobermans don't talk.

                             DR. GONZO
                        Those Satanists fight like hell if you
                        try to take their heads without dogs.

                             DA #2
                        God almighty!

                             DA #1
                        I could never tell my wife about this.
                        She'd never understand.  You know what
                        women are.

     DR. GONZO splits.  DUKE rises, hand over his chest, as if
     having a HEART TREMOR.

                             DUKE
                        Just be thankful your heart is
                        young and strong.

     He shakes hands with the stunned DA'S.

                             DUKE V/O
                        It didn't make any difference that
                        we had heads full of mescaline and acid.
                        In scenes like this, there's not much
                        risk in acting like a king-hell freak.


     <u>ON THE STREETS OF LAS VEGAS</u>     EXT     NIGHT

     The WHITE WHALE cruises.  DUKE, behind TEA-SHADES, drives.
     DR. GONZO hurls abuse at passing cars and vomits out of the
     window.  Passing a bottle of rum back and forth, they go by
     a NEON CASINO SIGN:  GORILLA ACT NIGHTLY.

                             DUKE V/O
                        Vegas is so full of natural freaks--
                        people who are genuinely twisted--that
                        drugs aren't much of a problem.
                        Psychedelics are almost irrelevant in a
                        town where you can wander into a casino
                        and witness the crucifixion of a gorilla-
                        on a flaming neon cross that suddenly
                        turns into a pinwheel, spinning the beast
                        around in wild circles above the crowded
                        gambling action.

     The WHITE WHALE pulls up beside a BLUE FORD.
     TWO CONVENTIONEER COUPLES.

                             DR. GONZO
                        Hey there!  You folks want to buy
                        some heroin?

     The COUPLES don't react.  Pretend he's not there.

                             DR. GONZO
                        Hey, honkies!  Cheap heroin!  This is
                        the real stuff!  You won't get hooked!
                        You folks never talked to a <u>vet</u> before?
                        I just got back with it from Vietnam!
                        Pure scag!  Jab it right in your fucking
                        eyeballs.

     The MAN IN THE BACK SEAT, enraged, lunges against the glass,
     trying to get at GONZO.

                             DR. GONZO
                        Shoot!  Fuck!  Scag!  Blood!
                        Rape!  Cheap!  Communist!

     DUKE hits the brakes, shooting GONZO against the dashboard.
     The FORD surges ahead.  DUKE makes a quick turn behind it,
     almost losing control.  He straightens it out, turns and
     FISHTAILS again.

                             GONZO
                          (laughs madly)
                        Jesus Christ.  That guy was trying
                        to <u>bite</u> me.

                             DUKE
                        I don't like the way this thing is
                        cornering...

     They RACE away.


     <u>GAS STATION</u>     EXT     NIGHT

     TWO ATTENDANTS watch in horror as a THIRD ATTENDANT, under
     DUKE's manic direction, pumps air into the WHITE WHALE'S
     TIRES.

                             DUKE
                        Pump it up to 75!  Make it 100!

                             THIRD ATTENDANT
                        They'll explode!

                             DUKE
                        These are experimental tires!  I told
                        you!  I'LL TAKE THE RESPONSIBILITY!

     The ATTENDANT finishes, jumps back as the WHITE WHALE
     SCREECHES out of the station, taking a corner in a very
     stylish manner.


     <u>WHITE WHALE</u>     INT     NIGHT

     DUKE drives through the night.

                             DUKE
                        I could go for some coffee.

                             DR. GONZO
                        Right up here.  Terry's Taco Stand
                        USA.  Five tacos for a buck.

                             DUKE
                        I'd rather go somewhere where there's
                        one for 50 cents.

                             DR. GONZO
                        No, don't judge a taco by its price.


     <u>TACO STAND</u>     EXT     NIGHT

     The WHITE WHALE is parked at the window.

                             WAITRESS
                        May I help you?

                             DR. GONZO
                        Yeah.  These tacos.  Are they Mexican?

                             WAITRESS
                        We have tacos.  I don't know how
                        Mexican they are.

                             DR. GONZO
                        I'll take five of them.

                             WAITRESS
                          (over her shoulder)
                        Five tacos, Lou.

                             DR. GONZO
                        As your attorney I advise you to get
                        the chiliburger.

                             DUKE
                        That's too heavy for me.
                        And a coffee.

                             WAITRESS
                        And a coffee.  Anything else?

                             DR. GONZO
                        Yeah.  Where are you from?

                             WAITRESS
                        New York.

                             DR. GONZO
                        And you've just been here a day.

                             WAITRESS
                        No, I've been here a while.

                             DR. GONZO
                        Where do you go around here?
                        Say you wanted to go swimming?

                             WAITRESS
                        In my backyard.

                             DR. GONZO
                        What's the address?

                             WAITRESS
                        Um, go to the... ah... the pool's
                        not open yet.  Anything else?

                             DR. GONZO
                        Yeah.  The American Dream.  You know
                        where that is?  We were told it was
                        somewhere in this area...

                             WAITRESS
                        Hey, Lou, you know where the American
                        Dream is?
                          (hands over bag)
                        Five tacos and a coffee.

     LOU, the cook, appears.

                             LOU
                        The American Dream?  You mean, like
                        a discotheque or something?

                             DR. GONZO
                        Sort of.  We were told, take this
                        white Cadillac and go till you find
                        the American dream.  It's somewhere
                        in the Las Vegas area.

                             LOU
                        Only place like that near here's
                        the Old Psychiatrist's Club.
                        Right off Paradise and Eastern.

                             WAITRESS
                        I think that place burned down.

                             LOU
                        They're just remodeling it.

                             WAITRESS
                        Oh.

                             DR. GONZO
                        Great tacos.

                             WAITRESS
                        Paradise and Eastern.  You might
                        want to try there.  I never heard
                        it called the American Dream, though.

                             DUKE
                        We'll find it.  Thanks.

     CUT TO:


     <u>PARADISE & EASTERN</u>     EXT     DAWN

     A burned-out concrete husk, obviously long-abandoned, on the
     edge of the desert.  DUKE and GONZO sit in the WHITE WHALE,
     eating tacos as the sun rises behind them.

                             DUKE V/O
                        Five days in Las Vegas is like
                        five years anywhere else.


     <u>FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE</u>     INT     DAY

     PAN OF THE ROOM.  Total destruction.  TEN FOOT MIRROR
     SHATTERED.  RED AND BLUE CHRISTMAS LIGHTS in the light
     fixtures.  USED TOWELS, stained with mustard, catsup, and
     other vile substances, hang everywhere.  Uneaten french
     fries.  COCONUT HUSKS.  Dessicated HONEYDEW RINDS.

     DR. GONZO'S BED, empty, is a rat's nest of burned bedding
     and exposed stuffing.

     The SOUNDS OF VOMITING come from a closet near the front
     door.

     DUKE, wired, sits on his bed, beer in hand, watching the TV.
     A CAMPUS RIOT.  SPIRO AGNEW lecturing the press.

                             DUKE V/O
                        I was feeling dangerously out of
                        phase with my surroundings.  The room
                        looked like the site of some disastrous
                        zoological experiment involving whiskey
                        and gorillas.  The general back-alley
                        ambience of the whole suite was so
                        incredibly foul that I figured I could
                        probably get away with claiming it was
                        some kind of "Life-slice" exhibit that
                        we'd brought down from Haight Street, to
                        show cops from other parts of the country
                        how deep into filth and degeneracy the
                        drug people will sink if left to their
                        own devices.

     MORE SOUNDS OF VOMITING.

                             DUKE
                          (calls out)
                        Are you aware that you are vomiting
                        in the closet, and NOT in the bathroom?

                             DUKE V/O
                          (as the VOMITING continues)
                        Something ugly was about to happen.
                        I was sure of it.
                          (PHONE rings)
                        Jesus, what now?  I could almost
                        hear the shrill voice of the manager,
                        Mr. Heem, saying the police were on
                        their way up to the room, and would I
                        please not shoot through the door when
                        they began kicking it down.

     RRRIIINNNGGG.  DUKE fatalistically shakes out his last two
     speed pills and swallows them.

                             DUKE V/O
                        No, they wouldn't call first.  Better
                        an ambush.  Mace.  No warning.

                             DUKE
                          (answers PHONE)
                        Yeah?

                             BRUCE INNES'S VOICE
                          (on PHONE)
                        Thompson?  That guy with the ape you
                        wanted's agreed on a price.  $750.

                             DUKE
                        What kind of greedhead are we dealing
                        with here?  Last night it was four
                        hundred.

                             DR. GONZO
                          (to DUKE)
                        She must have used a pass key.  I was
                        polishing my shoes in the closet when I
                        noticed her sneaking in--so I <u>took</u> <u>her</u>.

     DUKE shakes his head.

                             DUKE V/O
                        This time we'd gone too far.  A <u>hotel</u>
                        <u>employee</u>.  She would have to be dealt
                        with.

                             DUKE
                          (barks at the MAID)
                        What made you do it?  Who paid you off?

                             DR. GONZO
                        You're part of it, aren't you!  The
                        DOPE RING!

                             MAID
                        All I wanted to do was clean up your
                        room!  I don't know anything about dope!
                        I swear to Jesus I never heard of that
                        stuff!

     DR. GONZO seems to think, helps her to her feet.

                             DR. GONZO
                        Maybe she's telling the truth.  Maybe
                        she's <u>not</u> part of it.  Maybe she can
                        <u>help</u>.

                             MAID
                        Yes!  I'll help you all you need,
                        officer!  I <u>hate</u> dope!

                             DUKE
                        So do we, lady.

                             DR. GONZO
                        I think we should put her on the
                        payroll.  Have her checked out.
                        See what she comes up with.

                             DUKE
                        Good idea.  She's inside.  She'll <u>know</u>.
                          (to MAID)
                        Would a thousand a month be enough?

                             MAID
                        A thousand what?  <u>Dollars</u>?  Oh Lord!
                        I'd do just about anything for that!

                             DUKE
                        You and a lot of other people.  You'd
                        be surprised who else is on our payroll.
                        Right here in the hotel.

                             DR. GONZO
                          (hustling her out the door)
                        One phone call every day, just tell us
                        what you've seen.  Don't worry if it
                        doesn't add up.  That's <u>our</u> problem.
                        What's your name?

                             MAID
                        Alice. Just ring Linen Service and
                        ask for Alice.

                             DUKE
                        You'll be contacted.  The password is
                        "One hand washes the other."  The minute
                        you hear that, you say, "I fear nothing."

                             MAID
                        "I fear nothing."

                             DR. GONZO
                        Oh, and don't bother to make up the room.
                        Just leave a pile of towels and soap
                        outside the door exactly at midnight.

                             MAID
                        Whatever you say, gentlemen.  I can't
                        tell you how sorry I am about what
                        happened...but it was only because
                        I didn't <u>realize</u>.

                             DR. GONZO
                        We understand.  But it's all over
                        now.  Thank God for <u>decent</u> people.

     She SMILES as he shuts the door.
     PAUSE.  Then DUKE throws his stuff into his satchel and
     swings it over his shoulder, heading for the door.

                             DUKE
                        Well, that's it.  I suggest you
                        get us reservations on the next
                        airplane out of here.

                             DR. GONZO

                        To see a man about an ape.


     <u>FLAMINGO HOTEL ELEVATOR</u>     INT     DAY

     DUKE, sweating, watches the numbers.

                             DUKE V/O
                        We'd abused every rule, by now, that
                        Vegas lived by--abusing the tourists,
                        burning the locals, terrifying the help.
                        The authorities were perfectly capable,
                        under these circumstances, of sending
                        us both to prison for about twenty years.


     <u>FLAMINGO HOTEL BAR</u>     INT     DAY

     DUKE enters, failing to notice TWO AMBULANCE ATTENDANTS
     carrying out an OLD MAN.

                             DUKE
                          (to BARTENDER)
                        Tequila.
                          (to himself)
                        I've got to get out of this place.

     BRUCE INNES appears at his elbow.

                             INNES
                        Thompson?  Bruce Innes.

                             DUKE
                        Look, where's the ape?  I'm ready
                        to write a check.  I'm kind of in a
                        hurry.

                             INNES
                          (shrugs)
                        Forget it. They just took him away.
                        He attacked an old man right here in
                        the bar.  The creep started hassling the
                        bartender about "allowing barefoot rabble
                        in the place" and just then the ape let
                        out a shriek--so the old guy threw a beer
                        at him, and the ape went crazy, came out
                        of his seat like a jack-in-the-box and
                        took a big bite out of the old man's
                        head.  The cops carne and took the ape
                        away.  Sorry, man.

     He shakes his head.  CLOSE IN on DUKE, suddenly grief-
     stricken.

                             DUKE V/O
                        I was stunned.  I really wanted that ape.
                        I wanted to take the bastard back home on
                        the plane with me.  Two first-class seats
                        - R. Duke and son.  I thought about going
                        down to the jail and bailing it out.
                        But then I thought:  better stay clear
                        of that jail.

                             DUKE
                        Forget the ape.  I don't need him.

     DUKE drinks, orders one more for the road.

                             DUKE V/O
                        No point hanging around this town
                        any longer.

     TWO GRIZZLY-LOOKING BOUNCERS appear on either side.

                             BOUNCER #1
                        It's time to go.

                             DUKE
                        What?

     They MARCH him out.


     <u>FLAMINGO HOTEL FRONT PORTICO</u>     EXT     DAY

     BOUNCER #2 whistles for the CARBOY to bring the WHITE WHALE.

                             BOUNCER #1
                        Where's your friend?  The big spic?

                             DUKE
                        Look.  I'm a Doctor of Journalism.
                        You'd never catch me hanging around
                        this place with a goddamn spic.

                             BOUNCER #1
                          (producing PHOTOGRAPHS)
                        What about these then?

     The top one is of DUKE sitting next to GONZO at a table
     in the Floating Bar.  DUKE backs away, gets in the WHITE
     WHALE.

                             DUKE
                        That's not me.  That's a guy named
                        DUKE.  He works for <u>Rolling</u> <u>Stone</u>.
                        A really vicious, crazy kind of person.
                        And that guy with him is a hit-man
                        for the Mafia in Hollywood...

     At that moment DR. GONZO emerges from the hotel, closely
     followed by SEVERAL UNIFORMED THUGS whom he has hired to
     carry his luggage set, glassware, soap bars and other
     acquisitions.

     He hands each THUG a five-spot as they load the car, and
     gets in beside DUKE.

     DUKE takes off with a PEAL OF RUBBER on the hugely inflated
     tires.

                             DR. GONZO'S VOICE
                        As your attorney I advise you drive
                        faster.  We have fifteen fucking
                        minutes to get on that plane.


     <u>DESERT OUTSIDE LAS VEGAS</u>     EXT     DAY

     The WHITE WHALE sails through an intersection as the light
     turns red.

     GONZO paws over a map.

                             DR. GONZO
                        What are you doing?  You were
                        supposed to turn back there!

     He looks wildly around.  They are on a deserted freeway.
     running parallel to the airport runway.

                             DR. GONZO
                        Goddamnit!  What are we doing
                        out here on this godforsaken
                        road?  The airport is over <u>there</u>!

                             DUKE
                        Don't worry. I've never missed
                        a plane yet.  Except once in Peru.
                        I was already checked out of the
                        country, through customs, but I
                        went back to the bar --

     DUKE's story fades out as the WIND NOISE intensifies.

     ANGLE ON DUKE'S WATCH, a skeleton-face Accutron.

                             DUKE V/O
                        There was only one way to make
                        it on time.

     He hits the brakes and runs the WHALE down into the grassy
     moat freeway divider.  Wheels churning, he makes it up the
     opposite bank, nose of the car straight up, then bounces
     onto the freeway and keeps going right over a fence,
     dragging it through a cactus field and onto the --


     <u>AIRPORT RUNWAY</u>     EXT     DAY

     DR. GONZO is frozen with fear.

     DUKE continues his story.

                             DUKE
                        -- I woke up about two hours later
                        in a bar in downtown Lima.  My luggage
                        was all stacked beside me.  Nobody
                        had opened it --

     They drive under a parked AIRPLANE.  DUKE shouting above
     the wind, tarmac noise, and jet engine whine.

                             DUKE
                        So I went back to sleep and caught
                        the first flight out, the next morning.
                          (checks his ACCUTRON)
                        Three minutes, fifteen seconds
                        before takeoff.  Plenty of time.
                        I'll drop you next to the plane.

                             DR. GONZO
                        What about you?

                             DUKE
                        Better if we split up.  They're
                        looking for two of us, remember?

                             DR. GONZO
                        No!  I can't get out!  They'll crucify
                        me!  I'll have to take the blame!

                             DUKE
                        Just say you were hitchhiking to the
                        airport and I picked you up.

                             DR. GONZO
                        Why not?  But for Christ's sake,
                        let's do it fast!

     AT THE AIRPLANE

     DUKE screeches up in front of the jetliner.  GONZO jumps out
     and whistles to the GROUND CREW.  Astonished, they run up
     and, in a flurry of five dollar bills, grab his luggage,
     hustle it aboard the plane.

                             DUKE
                        Don't take any guff from these swine!
                        Remember!  If you have any trouble
                        you can always send a telegram to
                        the Right People!

     DR. GONZO saunters to the waiting plane.
     Then he turns back and waves at DUKE.

                             DR. GONZO
                        Yeah... Explaining my Position.
                        Some asshole wrote a poem about that
                        once.  It's probably good advice,
                        if you have shit for brains.

     DR. GONZO climbs the steps, waving, like Jackie Kennedy.

                             DUKE
                        Right.

     The plane door closes.  The WHITE WHALE accelerates away.


     <u>LAS VEGAS CITY LIMITS</u>     EXT     DAY

     The WHALE races into the desert.


     <u>DESERT HIGHWAY</u>     EXT     DAY

     DUKE, drinking a BEER, drives the wrecked WHALE.  A PIECE OF
     THE FENCE flies out of the back seat as he takes a bump.

                             DUKE V/O
                        There was only one road back to L.A.
                        U.S. Interstate 15, just a flat-out
                        high speed burn through Baker and
                        Barstow and Berdoo, then on the
                        Hollywood Freeway straight into frantic
                        oblivion:  safety, obscurity, just
                        another freak in the Freak Kingdom.

     He passes a HIGHWAY PATROL CAR parked at the side of the
     road.  The PATROL CAR pulls out behind him, LIGHTS FLASHING.

                             DUKE V/O
                        Jesus, I thought--what would Horatio
                        Alger do in a situation like this?

     He ACCELERATES.  The SPEEDOMETER CLIMBS STEADILY.


     <u>FARTHER UP THE ROAD</u>     EXT     DAY

     The PATROL CAR screams after the WHITE WHALE.

                             DUKE V/O
                        Few people understand the psychology
                        of dealing with a highway traffic cop.
                        Your normal speeder will panic and
                        immediately pull over to the side when
                        he sees the big red light behind him...
                        apologizing, begging for mercy.

     DUKE starts checking the side of the road for the RIGHT
     EXIT.  His TURN SIGNAL comes on.

                             DUKE V/O
                        This is wrong.  It arouses contempt
                        in the cop heart.  What you want to do
                        is <u>accelerate</u>.  Mash it down and make the
                        bastard chase you at 120 to the next
                        exit.  He won't know what to make of
                        your blinker-signal that says you're
                        about to turn right.

     AN EXIT OFF-RAMP:  AN UPHILL SIDE-LOOP.  Speed sign says:
     MAX SPEED 25.

     DUKE heads for this.

                             DUKE V/O
                        The trick, at this point, is to suddenly
                        leave the freeway and take him into the
                        chute at no less than a hundred miles
                        an hour.

     And so it happens.  DUKE is ready for the chute, brakes with
     some fancy heel-toe work, and comes smoothly to a stop at
     the top of the ramp, while the PATROL CAR spins and
     fishtails out of control before bouncing to a stop beside
     him.

     DUKE stands beside the WHITE WHALE, completely relaxed.

     The HIGHWAY PATROLMAN, a handsome, clean-cut guy of about
     thirty, gets out of the car, screaming.

                             HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
                        Just what the FUCK did you think you
                        were doing?

     DUKE smiles.

                             DUKE V/O
                        Let him calm down.  The idea is
                        to show him you were always in
                        control of yourself and your vehicle.

                             HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
                        May I see your license...<u>please</u>?

     DUKE reaches for it.  And BOTH MEN look down at the BEER CAN
     he has forgotten in his hand.

                             DUKE V/O
                        I knew I was fucked.

     The COP relaxes.  Faintly smiles.  Reaches out for DUKE's
     wallet, then holds out his other hand for the BEER.

                             HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
                        Could I have that, please?

                             DUKE
                        Why not?  It was getting warm anyway.

     The HIGHWAY PATROLMAN takes it, pours out the beer.  Both
     MEN look automatically into the BACK SEAT of the WHITE
     WHALE.  A CASE OF BEER.

                             HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
                          (enjoying himself)
                        You realize it's a crime to--

                             DUKE V/O
                        My guilt was so gross and overwhelming
                        that explanations were useless.

                             DUKE
                        Yeah.  I know.  I'm guilty.  I
                        understand that.  I knew it was a
                        crime, but I did it anyway.
                          (shrugs)
                        Shit, why argue?  I'm a fucking criminal.

                             HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
                        That's a strange attitude.

     He looks at DUKE thoughtfully.

                             HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
                        You know--I get the feeling you could
                        use a nap.  There's a rest area up ahead.
                        Why don't you pull over and sleep a
                        few hours?

                             DUKE V/O
                        I instantly understood what he was
                        telling me.  But for some insane
                        reason, I shook my head.

                             DUKE
                        A nap won't help.  I've been awake for
                        too long--three or four nights.  I
                        can't even remember.  If I go to sleep
                        now, I'm dead for twenty hours.

     The HIGHWAY PATROLMAN smiles.

                             HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
                        Okay.  Here's how it is.  What goes
                        into my book, as of noon, is that I
                        apprehended you...for driving too fast.
                        and advised you to proceed no further
                        than the next rest area...your stated
                        destination, right?  Where you plan to
                        take a long nap.  Do I make myself clear?

                             DUKE
                          (shrugs)
                        How far is Baker?  I was hoping to
                        stop there for lunch.

                             HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
                        Not my jurisdiction.  The city limits
                        are two-point-two miles beyond the rest
                        area.  Can you make it that far?

                             DUKE
                        I'll try.  I've been wanting to go to
                        Baker for a long time.  I've heard a
                        lot about it.

     The PATROLMAN gets in his CAR and starts it up.  Leans out
     the window.

                             HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
                        Excellent seafood.  With a mind like
                        yours, you'll probably want to try the
                        land-crab.  Try the Majestic Diner.


     <u>THE ROAD TO BAKER</u>     EXT     DAY

     DUKE drives PAST THE REST STOP.

                             DUKE V/O
                        I felt raped.  The pig had done me
                        on all fronts and now he was going to
                        chuckle about it--on the west edge of
                        town, waiting for me to make a run for
                        L.A.


     <u>THE TURN-OFF FOR BAKER</u>     EXT     DAY

     DUKE turns and drives past the HITCHHIKER from the drive
     out.  The boy sees him and immediately DROPS HIS THUMB.

     DUKE ignores him, drives on.


     <u>BAKER</u>     EXT     DAY

     The WHITE WHALE pulls up across from the MAJESTIC DINER.

     DUKE looks around.  The HARDWARE BARN beside him has a huge
     red sign:  BEER.

     He goes in there.


     <u>HARDWARE BARN</u>     INT     DAY

     Filled with hardware and GOLD LIGHT - an idyllic,
     Rockwellian scene.

                             DUKE V/O
                        Jesus Creeping God!  Is there a
                        priest in this tavern?  I want to
                        confess!  I'm a fucking <u>sinner</u>!
                        Venal, mortal, carnal, major, minor--
                        whatever you want to call it.  Lord...
                        I'm guilty.

     DUKE enters, sits on a stool next to a WORKBENCH.

                             DUKE V/O
                        But do me this one last favor:  just
                        give me five more high-speed hours
                        before you bring the hammer down: just
                        let me get off of this horrible desert.

     The PROPRIETOR appears, smiling, from where he's been
     working on an old REMINGTON TYPEWRITER.  He steps into a
     pool of GOLD SUNLIGHT.

                             DUKE
                        I know this is a mystic longshot.
                        No way you'd have Ballantine's Ale...

     The PROPRIETOR smiles again and produces one from an ice
     chest, along with an icy cold MASON JAR to drink it from.

                             PROPRIETOR
                        If it's not cold enough, I got some
                        chilling out back.
                          (pause)
                        Where you coming from?

                             DUKE
                        Las Vegas.

                             PROPRIETOR
                        Great town, that Vegas.  I bet
                        you had good luck there.  You're
                        the type.

                             DUKE
                        I know.  I'm a triple Scorpio.

                             PROPRIETOR
                        A fine combination.

                             DUKE
                        Don't worry.  I'm actually the
                        district attorney from Ignoto
                        county.  Just another good American
                        like yourself.

     The PROPRIETOR's smile disappears.

     Wordlessly, he turns back to his work.  His pretty TEENAGE
     DAUGHTER appears and kisses him hello.  They talk together,
     ignoring DUKE.

     Who feels ashamed.

     He throws his money on the bench and leaves.


     <u>BAKER</u>     EXT     DAY

     DUKE reaches in the back seat of the WHITE WHALE for another
     warm beer.  Spots something on the floor.  Dives for it.
     ONE LAST AMYL CAPSULE.

     Grabs it up and CRACKS IT UNDER HIS NOSE.

     POUNDS HIS CHEST with the rush and LAUGHS LIKE A MADMAN.

     ACROSS THE STREET - TWO YOUNG MARINES come out of the
     MAJESTIC DINER.

     DUKE starts the engine.  Leans out and YELLS at the MARINES.

                             DUKE
                        GOD'S MERCY ON YOU SWINE!

     Cackling, he takes off in the TRASHED, VOMIT-STREAKED WHITE
     CADILLAC, with a ROAR and a CLOUD OF BLACK OILY SMOKE.

     The TWO MARINES look after him, confused.


     <u>IN THE WHITE WHALE</u>     EXT     DAY

     Still laughing, DUKE cranks up the TAPE RECORDER, adjusts
     his TEASHADES.

                             DUKE V/O
                        By the time I got back on the road.
                        my heart was full of joy.  I felt
                        like a monster reincarnation of
                        Horatio Alger...a Man on the Move,
