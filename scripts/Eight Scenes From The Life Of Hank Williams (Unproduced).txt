               The camera opens tight on Hank Williams' face: cold, puffy, 
               ghostly white.

               In the background, a male quartet sings an off-key version 
               of "I Saw the Light."

               Hank wears his white double-breasted suit with black piping. 
               His lips are pinched without expression. He says nothing.

               The camera pulls back, revealing Hank Williams stretched out 
               in his coffin. A wail is heard in the distance.

               A floral arrangement in the shape of an open Bible stands at 
               the head of the casket; a guitar-shaped arrangement at the 
               foot. Between them is a large pillow of white carnations 
               studded with quarter notes fashioned from gold foil.

               Continuing to boom, the camera pulls away from Hank's body, 
               over the stage and tilts to face the 3,000 mourners crammed 
               into Montgomery's Municipal Auditorium.

               It is January 4, 1953. Standing with their backs to the 
               camera, the quintet continues to sing: Roy Acuff, Little 
               Jimmy Dickens, Carl Smith, Ernest Tubb and Red Foley. Hank's 
               band, The Drifting Cowboys, accompanies them.

               The camera tracks through the quintet, over the casket and 
               past the tearful faces of those who have played roles in 
               Hank Williams' short life: his mother Lillian, his first 
               wife, Audrey, and children, Randall and Lycrecia. In the 
               second row are Billie Jean, his second wife, and Miss Ragland, 
               the governess. Further back are friends and associates: Fred 
               Rose, Lum York, Minnie Pearl, Ray Price, Jim Denny, Vic 
               McAlpin, Faron Young, Nudie, Dudley LeBlanc, and Billy Walker.

               But, mostly, the camera passes sad rows of simply-dressed 
               people who have traveled hundreds of miles to pay homage to 
               a man who they only knew by the sound of his voice.

               OUTSIDE, a throng estimated at 20,000 persons crowds into 
               the streets surrounding the red brick, neo-classic Auditorium. 
               Two flatbed trucks of flowers wait the funeral procession. 
               Perry Street is a sea of somberly dressed men and women.

               Hank Williams' funeral was the largest single outpouring of 
               public grief in Montgomery's history, equaled only by that 
               for Martin Luther King fifteen years later.

                                     THE HONKY TONKS

                                       Spring, 1945

               INT. CLUB 31 - NIGHT

               HANK WILLIAMS, 21-years-old and in the full prime of his 
               life, whips out a long leg, hunches over and sets into "Honky-
               Tonkin'." He looks awkward and gangling, like a good meal 
               and a little love would do him. His voice cuts through the 
               room like a buzz saw through new pine:

               "Just come to see me baby, and bring along some dough, and 
               we'll go honky-tonkin'..."

               Hank wears a western shirt with a double-breasted weskit, a 
               Cattleman hat over his forehead, cowboy slacks and boots. 
               The "Drifting Cowboys" wear whatever they want. DON HELMS 
               plays steel guitar. LUM YORK, the bass player who doubles as 
               a comedian, wears polkadot makeup, a blacked-out tooth and 
               pants cut from a potato sack.

               Club 31 was a roadhouse on U.S. 31, the two-lane blacktop 
               which leads south from Montgomery toward the rural Alabama 
               towns where Hank Williams was born and raised. It was one of 
               those honky-tonks where, Don Helms later said, "they sweep 
               out the eyeballs with the glass in the morning."

               The room is stripped to the essentials: walls, tables, bar, 
               stage. Everything else has been broken in weekly brawls.

               The crowd is an unstable mixture of hillbillies, factory 
               workers and servicemen from nearby Maxwell Air Force Base. 
               Wartime tarts rub elbows with roughhewn country women in 
               print dresses.

               Hank's wife, AUDREY, 22, takes tickets at the door. 
               Attractive, but not beautiful. Her shoulder-length auburn 
               hair gives Audrey a distinctive appearance -- as does her 
               dress: a blouse and vest, jodhpur breeches and cowboy boots.

               A steady stream of customers pass in and out of the club.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. CLUB 31 - NIGHT

               A group of young bucks cluster around their cars, pouring 
               their Co'-Colas on the ground. One young man then assists 
               the others, refilling their Coke bottles from a "spot bottle" 
               of bootleg whiskey. Lownes County, like most of Alabama, was 
               legally dry -- a fact which raised Southern manhood to rare 
               heights of resourcefulness.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CLUB 31 - NIGHT

               The crowd is getting "ripe." The band members exchange nervous 
               glances.

               But not Hank. Hitting the second stanza of "Honky-Tonkin'," 
               he juts his right shoulder out and wobbles his knees back 
               and forth. His thin, angular face ripples with an emotional 
               wail.

               These are not unconscious mannerisms. Hank knows exactly 
               what he's doing: he's playing to the ladies. He lays those 
               lonesome brown eyes on each woman as if she's the only one 
               in the room.

               The effect is not lost on the women in the audience -- nor 
               on their husbands and dates.

               One drunken LOCAL BRUISER, fed up with watching his wife 
               moon over Hank, pulls himself to his feet, staggers over to 
               the stage and calls out:

                                     LOCAL BRUISER
                         My wife listens to your goddam show 
                         on the radjo every morning, and I 
                         tol her if she listened to you again 
                         I wuz gonna hit her right square 
                         upside the head.

               The Drifting Cowboys stop playing. Lum pulls a blackjack out 
               of his baggy pants. Don Helms tucks his glasses into his 
               shirt pocket.

               Hank picks a Coke off an upright speaker, takes a swig (his 
               grimace indicates it contains more than soda pop), and turns 
               to the drunk:

                                     HANK
                         Well, boy, why don't ya just turn it 
                         off? That's why they put knobs on 
                         the thang.

                                     LOCAL BRUISER
                         Come to think about it, I'ma gonna 
                         beat the shit outa you rat now.

               The bruiser charges toward Hank. The Drifting Cowboys, packing 
               their instruments, head toward the rear exit.

               Hank defends himself the only way possible -- with his guitar. 
               The Local Bruiser catches a Sunburst right square in the 
               face as the club breaks into bedlam.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. ALABAMA ROAD - NIGHT

               Hank and Audrey's 1939 grey Chevy makes its way down the 
               dark country roads toward Montgomery. Lum's bass protrudes 
               from the trunk. The old car slows down, sputters and starts 
               up again.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CAR - NIGHT

               The occupants rock with the car. Hank is slouched in the 
               rear seat with Audrey and Lum. Don Helms is at the wheel.

               The Bailey Brothers sing "The Sweetest Gift" over the static-
               filled radio. The jerking car near spills the whiskey from 
               the bottle cradled between Hank's legs.

                                     HANK
                         Damn, Shag. What all was that?

                                     DON HELMS
                         Jus be happy if this heap makes it 
                         at all, Hank.

                                     HANK
                         Where we goin' this weekend?

                                     AUDREY
                         'Round home. Andulusia, Enterprise, 
                         Camden.

                                     HANK
                         Good folks in Andulusia. Momma always 
                         booked me there. Play for them folks 
                         all night. Not like these boys back 
                         here. They don't come to listen, 
                         they come to fight.

               Hank slips his hat off, cradles his head against Audrey's 
               shoulder and tries to sleep.

                                     DON HELMS
                         Don't worry. Won't be long we'll see 
                         the light from the Montgomery beacon. 
                         Then we'll know we'll make it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. LILLY'S BOARDING HOUSE - NIGHT

               The Drifting Cowboys straggle into Lilly's two-story wood-
               frame house on Katoma Street in downtown Montgomery.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LILLY'S BOARDING HOUSE - NIGHT

               The band members drag-ass down the hallway. The air smells 
               of musty wood, yellowed wallpaper and cheap perfume. A young 
               soldier, saying goodnight to a "girlfriend," steps out of a 
               room and passes them.

               Hank, Audrey and various Cowboys stayed at Lilly's until 
               they moved to Shreveport in 1948. The boarding house was 
               also home base for a number of single girls without visible 
               means of support. The War brought servicemen to Montgomery, 
               and with the servicemen came indigent girls from outlying 
               communities. On a single night in 1945, the police picked up 
               350 girls for prostitution in downtown Montgomery. Not 
               coincidentally, Lilly's boarding house was down the block 
               from The Jefferson Davis, Montgomery's largest hotel.

               LILLIAN STONE, 47, standing in the black dress she wore all 
               her life, waits in the hall for her son. Mrs. Stone stood 
               5'11", weighed 200 pounds and was, by the most generous 
               accounts, decisive, tough-talking and high-tempered. "She 
               had a strong punch and would lay you out just like a man," 
               Lum York recalls.

                                     LILLIAN
                              (ignoring others)
                         Hiram.

               Hank embraces her.

                                     HANK
                         Momma.

                                     LILLIAN
                         Where's your gui-tar?

                                     HANK
                         Lost it again, Momma.

               Hank, tired and drunk, heads for his room. The Drifting 
               Cowboys file into another room as Lilly corners Audrey:

                                     LILLIAN
                         How much did you get?

                                     AUDREY
                         Fifty-five bucks.

                                     LILLIAN
                         Where is it?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HANK AND AUDREY'S ROOM - NIGHT

               Hank removes the .38 he wore to the honky-tonks from his 
               waistband and sets it on the walnut dresser. He pulls off 
               his boots, unbuttons his shirt and plops down on the bed.

               Snapshots of Lilly and other relatives stand on the dresser 
               next to Hank's pistol. Two shotguns rest against the floral 
               wallpaper.

               Hank can hear Audrey and Lilly through the door:

                                     AUDREY (O.S.)
                         I had to pay the boys.

                                     LILLY (O.S.)
                         So?

                                     AUDREY (O.S.)
                         Then Hank and me.

                                     LILLY (O.S.)
                         Where's my boarding money?

                                     AUDREY (O.S.)
                         You'll get it. Hank broke a guitar. 
                         He has to get a new one.

                                     LILLY (O.S.)
                         Where's Hiram? I'll ask him.

                                     AUDREY (O.S.)
                         Don't bother him. He's got to be on 
                         radio by six.

               Lilly calls out in her sing-song "poor me" voice for Hank to 
               overhear:

                                     LILLY (O.S.)
                         Hiram wouldn't do that to his Momma. 
                         I'll see him. I need the money 
                         tomorra.

                                     AUDREY (O.S.)
                         Don't be giving me that crap. You 
                         liquor him up so you can take his 
                         money.

                                     LILLY (O.S.)
                         Somebody has to look out for him.

                                     AUDREY (O.S.)
                         That's just what I'm doin.

               There are sounds of footsteps as Lilly heads towards Hank's 
               room and Audrey grabs her. Scuffling and fighting are heard 
               outside the door. Hank pulls his pale white "Cattleman" cowboy 
               hat over his eyes and drifts off to sleep.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. DOTHAN RADIO STUDIO - DAY

               The local DOTHAN DJ sits at the oversized WAGF microphone 
               with PEE WEE KING. The station's small second-floor studio 
               gives them a panoramic view of Dothan, a sleepy peanut-farming 
               town.

               Pee Wee, 31, wears a grey-and-black double-breasted western 
               suit and slicked down hair. MINNIE PEARL, 33, wearing a print 
               dress, stands behind them.

                                     DOTHAN D.J.
                              (obsequious)
                         Again, we'uns want to thank Pee Wee 
                         King for takin' tahm out of his busy 
                         schedule to drop by WAGF, the Voice 
                         of Southeast Alabama, to chew a few 
                         words with us. Pee Wee and his Golden 
                         West Cowboys will be with the Camel 
                         Caravan gang over at the Arm'ry 
                         tonight at 8 o'clock. Thank ya again, 
                         Pee Wee.

                                     PEE WEE KING
                         Anytime, Riley. It's my pleasure and 
                         honor to be entertainin' you folks 
                         in Dothan and hope to enjoy you'all 
                         in person tonight.

                                     DOTHAN D.J.
                         Along with Pee Wee will be appearin' 
                         Becky Barkly singin' her new song, 
                         "My Cowboy's Riding Now for Uncle 
                         Sam" and also a gal known well to 
                         all you folks, "The Gossip of 
                         Grinder's Switch," Cousin Minnie 
                         Pearl.

               Pee Wee gets up and walks off as Minnie takes his seat by 
               the mike.

                                     MINNIE PEARL
                         How-dee!

                                     DOTHAN D.J.
                         How's thangs in Grinder's Switch, 
                         Minnie?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. DOTHAN STATION CORRIDOR - DAY

               Pee Wee walks out of the studio and runs into Hank and Audrey 
               waiting in the narrow corridor. Hank, wearing an oversized 
               double-breasted brown suit, boots and a Stetson, gets up off 
               his haunches as Pee Wee approaches.

               Minnie Pearl's voice is heard in the background:

                                     MINNIE PEARL (O.S.)
                         Thangs hain't so well at the Switch, 
                         Riley. Uncle Nabob has done takin' 
                         hisself plumb sick and sez he hain't 
                         a-gonna till no land no more. He jus 
                         wants to dis-till it...

               Hank approaches Pee Wee King:

                                     HANK
                         King?

                                     PEE WEE KING
                         Howdy, Hank. What brings you here?

                                     HANK
                         Me an' the boys playing a schoolhouse 
                         in Slocomb. Got some new songs here, 
                         King, thought you might take a listen.

                                     PEE WEE KING
                         You know that poem you wuz playing 
                         in Montgomery, "Waitin' for the Day 
                         Peace'll Come"?
                              (Hank nods)
                         I've been thinkin'. Maybe Becky could 
                         use that.

                                     HANK
                         If you want it, King, it's yours. 
                         Take it. You can be co-writer.

                                     PEE WEE KING
                         Can't do that, Hank. Got to make it 
                         legal. Make it for "one dollar and 
                         other considerations."

                                     HANK
                         Not a buck, King. Can't you make it 
                         a little more?

               Minnie steps out of the studio and walks up to them.

                                     PEE WEE KING
                         Minnie, you know Hank Williams?

               Minnie Pearl, off-mike, drops her exaggerated accent and 
               becomes plain old Sarah Cooley, graduate of Ward-Belmont 
               College.

                                     MINNIE PEARL
                         No, but I've heard his name 
                         hereabouts.

                                     PEE WEE KING
                         This here's Hank and his wife Audrey.

               Hank, in awe of no one, makes a polite introduction. Audrey's 
               eyes reflect a different reaction: she is greatly impressed 
               by those with more, power or "culture."

                                     HANK
                         Pleased to meet you, Miz Pearl.

                                     AUDREY
                         How you feeling?

                                     MINNIE PEARL
                         Not so good. Got the worse kind of 
                         headache.

                                     AUDREY
                         Let's go to the drugstore and get 
                         some 'monia.

               Audrey and Minnie walk off and Hank turns back to Pee Wee:

                                     HANK
                         I'll tell you, King, you make it ten 
                         bucks and I know a boy who can get 
                         us some Southern Comfort.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SLOCOMB SCHOOLHOUSE - NIGHT

               During the day the white, tin-roofed one-room building serves 
               as a classroom for grades 1-12; during the evenings it's the 
               social center for eastern Geneva County.

               Fifty cars, trucks and pick-ups are parked along the red-
               dirt road. A sandwich sign in front of the schoolhouse reads: 
               "Hank Williams Tonight."

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SLOCOMB SCHOOLHOUSE - NIGHT

               The thirty pew-like rows of seats are crowded with all manner 
               of country folk: from plain-faced women in gingham dresses 
               to obese "good ol' boy" caricatures in their Sunday-go-to-
               meetin's.

               Hank, on stage with the Cowboys, wears a bright hand-painted 
               tie to offset his somber double-breasted suit. Hank preferred 
               double breasted suits with padded shoulders -- in fashion or 
               not -- because they filled out his spindle-shanked frame. 
               His tie is slightly off-center.

               Audrey, dressed in a fringed cowgirl outfit, stands behind 
               Hank. Lum York, wearing black-face and baggy pants, stands 
               by Hank, who plays the straightman.

               No microphone is needed: every word echoes through the small 
               room.

                                     LUM YORK
                              (shuffling)
                         Whys, Mistuh Hank, you don' beleeb 
                         in dose ghosts?

               Hank is a seasoned stage performer. He's been playing 
               churches, schoolhouses, bus stops and honky-tonks since he 
               was fifteen. He knows all the ways to manipulate crowds, 
               when to evoke laughter or tears, when to set their heels a-
               clicking. In fact, he feels more at home on stage than 
               anyplace else.

                                     HANK
                         Why no, Rasmus, I don't.

                                     LUM YORK
                         Missus Cholly's grand-daddy he 
                         ceaseded and become a ghost an goes-
                         a thump-thumpin' all ober de house.

               Hank points to the guitar behind Lum:

                                     HANK
                         Rasmus, hand me that guitar.

               Don Helms motions to Hank as Lum turns around to pick up the 
               guitar. When Lum turns back, Hank is gone.

               Hank crouches behind the podium and calls out:

                                     HANK
                         What was you sayin' about ghosts, 
                         Rasmus?

               Lum, confused, looks from side-to-side:

                                     LUM YORK
                         Mistuh Hank? Mistuh Hank?

                                     HANK
                         I'm right here, Rasmus, hand me that 
                         guitar.

               Lum extends the guitar toward the thin air. When his hand 
               accidentally passes over the strings, the guitar player picks 
               a loud twang.

                                     HANK
                              (angry)
                         I didn't say play, Rasmus! I said 
                         give it here.

               Lum rolls his eyeballs in mock fright as the audience cracks 
               up. Audrey, standing in the background, cringes. She thinks 
               Hank and Lum's black-face routine is "low-toned."

                                     LUM YORK
                         Oh, Lawdy, Lawdy.

               Lum drops the guitar and dashes off to the amusement of 
               everyone. Hank stands up, walks around the podium, picks up 
               the guitar and hits an opening chord.

               Lum walks back to his bass as Hank motions for the crowd to 
               give him a hand. They do, and Lum tips his hat in 
               appreciation.

               Hank hits the second chord and the band goes directly into 
               "Lost Highway":

               "I'm a rolling stone, All alone and lost, For a life of sin 
               I have paid the cost. When I pass by people say, Just another 
               guy on the lost highway."

               FADE OUT TO A TITLE READING:

                                        Fall, 1946

               EXT. WSM BUILDING - DAY

               Hank and Audrey enter the old WSM building in Nashville.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ACUFF-ROSE HALLWAY - DAY

               Guitar case in hand, Hank, wearing a black suit and white 
               Fedora, waits as Audrey knocks on a door reading "Acuff-Rose, 
               Music Publishers."

               Acuff-Rose is now a powerful music conglomerate, but in 1946 
               it was a small one-room office (preserved, intact, in the 
               company's Franklin Road office). Acuff-Rose had been founded 
               four years earlier by Fred Rose, a Tin Pan Alley songwriter 
               from Indiana, and Roy Acuff, a Grand Ole Opry regular. In 
               1946 Acuff-Rose may have been small, but it was the only 
               music publisher south of the Mason-Dixon line, and the only 
               place for an itinerant songwriter like Hank Williams to sell 
               his material professionally.

               Audrey knocks again. There's no answer.

               FRED ROSE and WESLEY ROSE, ping-pong paddles in hand, walk 
               down the hall toward Hank and Audrey.

               Fred Rose, 48, balding, wears thick glasses, loose trousers 
               and striped suspenders. Ten years before Rose, composer of 
               "Red Hot Mama," was broke, alcoholic and suicidal when he 
               became a devout Christian Scientist. Hard times brought him 
               to Nashville and, before he died in 1954, Rose had in large 
               measure determined the course of modern country music. His 
               son Wesley, 28, pudgy with black hair and mustache, kept the 
               books for his father's small company.

                                     AUDREY
                         Mr. Rose?

                                     FRED
                         Yes?

                                     AUDREY
                         This is my husband Hank Williams. 
                         We're from Montgomery. He's a 
                         songwriter and would like to sing 
                         some songs for you.

                                     FRED
                              (awkward)
                         Well...
                              (to Wes)
                         Do we have the time?

                                     WES
                         Except for lunch.

                                     FRED
                              (acquiesces)
                         Okay. Sure, why not?

               Fred tucks his paddle under his arm and, after some fumbling, 
               unlocks the office door and opens it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ACUFF-ROSE OFFICE - DAY

               Two metal desks face each other in the rectangular office. 
               Several framed sheet music covers hang on the pine-paneled 
               walls.

               Hank, finishing a song, sets down his guitar and looks across 
               at Fred Rose, who sits against the edge of his desk. Fred, 
               extremely near-sighted, strains to see him through his 
               glasses.

                                     AUDREY
                              (breaking the silence)
                         Hank doesn't just sang sad songs.

               Fred stands and takes a short step toward Hank:

                                     FRED
                         How old are you, son?

                                     HANK
                         Twenty-two.

                                     FRED
                         How long you been playing?

                                     HANK
                         You mean regular?
                              (Fred nods)
                         'Bout seven years, I reckon.

                                     AUDREY
                         He plays WASF in Montgomery.

                                     FRED
                         Who taught you to sing?

                                     HANK
                         My mama. And a nigger name of Tee-
                         Tot.

                                     FRED
                         Roy mentioned you once. Can you set 
                         this music down?

                                     HANK
                         You mean write music?
                              (Fred nods)
                         No. But I got more songs.
                              (no response)
                         I do a song like Acuff...

                                     FRED
                         Well, we're interested in the gospel 
                         songs. We're lookin' for something 
                         for Molly O'Day.
                              (a beat)
                         Look, why don't we just take these 
                         songs you've got now, what is it? 
                         Six of them?
                              (Hank beams)
                         I can't promise Molly'll cut any of 
                         them, but I won't cheat you either. 
                         We'll get you a regular contract and 
                         if this works out, maybe we could 
                         use some more songs.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LILLY'S BOARDING HOUSE - DAY

               It's about noon -- but you couldn't tell by looking at Hank 
               and the Drifting Cowboys. They've been on the road two weeks; 
               each seems to stagger out of the car in a different direction.

               The '39 Chevy has been replaced by a used grey Chrysler; 
               otherwise little has changed for Hank and his Drifting 
               Cowboys.

               They lug their equipment up the wood steps.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LILLY'S BOARDING HOUSE - DAY

               Lilly's boarding house clan sits around the dining room table. 
               Several girls, Hank's WATERHEAD COUSIN and the ever-silent 
               MR. STONE sit with Hank, Audrey and the boys.

               There's no decorum here. Diners get up or sit down as they 
               wish. The Cowboys bump elbows reaching across the table for 
               bowls of food.

               Hank dumps a quarter bottle of ketsup over an over-cooked 
               piece of meat and starts to eat. Dots of ketsup spot his 
               wrinkled, sweat-stained white shirt. Ernest Tubb sings 
               "Rainbow at Midnight" over the old box radio.

               Audrey counts a wrinkled stack of bills:

                                     AUDREY
                         You did fifteen shows and come home 
                         with two hundred and twenty dollars?

               There's a silence around the table. SAMMY PRUETT, now one of 
               the Drifting Cowboys, offers:

                                     SAMMY PRUETT
                         We had to buy some clothes.

                                     AUDREY
                              (to Sammy)
                         How dare you bring him home in this 
                         condition?

               Sammy says nothing. Hank, a little pie-eyed, tries to ignore 
               what's going on around him.

                                     AUDREY
                         And you keep telling me about the 
                         money we'll be making. You can't 
                         even support yourself.

               Hank stands up crookedly (a childhood back injury had 
               permanently ruined his posture), fishes through his pockets 
               and comes up with a wrinkled twenty dollar bill. He drops it 
               on the table and goes back to his ketsup.

                                     AUDREY
                         Big screwy deal.
                              (to Cowboys)
                         How much you boys hid for him?

               Lilly, watching from across the room, interjects:

                                     LILLIAN
                         Don't talk to my son that way. He 
                         ain't feeling good.

                                     AUDREY
                              (to Lilly)
                         You shut up. You only fight with 
                         him.

                                     LILLIAN
                         I've been fighting with him longer 
                         than you have.

               Hank turns to his mother:

                                     HANK
                         Shut up, Momma. Can't you see me an' 
                         Audrey's fightin'?

                                     AUDREY
                         Yeah.

                                     LILLIAN
                              (holding her heart)
                         Oh, Hiram, how dare...

                                     HANK
                         Shut up.
                              (to Audrey)
                         You too.

               The Cowboys, knowing what comes next, start to silently rise 
               and file out of the dining room.

                                     AUDREY
                         Hank Williams! You ungrateful S.O.B!

               Audrey grabs a pan of collard greens and chucks them across 
               the table at Hank. She rushes around the table and starts to 
               beat him about the head.

               Hank stands and swings wildly back. If he wasn't drunk, he 
               might land some of his blows. But then, if he wasn't drunk, 
               he wouldn't have the guts to stand up against Audrey either.

               They fight their way out of the dining room and into the 
               small water closet at the end of the hall.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. WATER CLOSET - DAY

               The 4 x 5 cubicle contains only an old-fashioned flush toilet. 
               Bits of poems and songs are scribbled on the faded wallpaper.

               Hank and Audrey are fought out. Crying, Hank wraps his arms 
               around her like a child.

                                     HANK
                         Audie, why you treat me this way?

               Tears come to Audrey's eyes as she looks at Hank's pleading 
               face. She starts to kiss him:

                                     AUDREY
                         I'm sorry, darling. I really am.

                                     HANK
                         I've been in that goddamn car so 
                         long and we broke down and my back 
                         hurts and I had to pay the boys and 
                         nobody...

                                     AUDREY
                         That's alright, baby.

                                     HANK
                         I'll do better next time. I just 
                         need a little lovin'.

                                     AUDREY
                         I love you, Hank. I truly do.

               Pulling him tighter, Audrey gives Hank a long, sexual kiss.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. OPEN FIELD - DAY

               Five hunters walk through an open field in the lush, rolling 
               pine-covered hills north of Montgomery.

               Hank, wearing a baseball cap, flannel shirt and cowboy slacks, 
               carries a bolt-action shotgun slung on his arm. Sammy Pruett 
               and TILMAN, a good old boy, walk along side him. Ahead, two 
               other GOOD OLD BOYS talk as they walk.

               Hank sings a chorus from a spiritual as he goes:

               "Are you ready to meet the Angel of Death?"

               He turns to Sammy:

                                     HANK
                         What's the matter, boy? Can't you 
                         carry a tune?

               It didn't matter that Sammy was older than Hank: everyone 
               was "boy" or "son" to him -- everyone, that is, except Fred 
               Rose, who he came to call "Pappy."

                                     SAMMY PRUETT
                         I didn't come to sing, I came to 
                         shoot.

                                     HANK
                         I hope you shoot better'n you sing.

               One of the Good Old Boys calls back:

                                     GOOD OLD BOY #1
                         I thank one of the dogs done spotted 
                         hisself sumpin'.

               They all stop.

                                     GOOD OLD BOY #2
                         Quail.

                                     TILMAN
                         That's no quail dog, that's a coon 
                         dog.

               As Tilman speaks, a flock of quail fly from the brush. They 
               aim and fire.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. RESTING SPOT - DAY

               They sit around the deserted share-cropper's cabin where the 
               car is parked. A string of quail hangs from the Chrysler's 
               door handle.

               Tilman sits on the steps, drinking a Coke, discoursing on 
               life in general.

               Hank, absorbed in his own thoughts, sits crouched beside the 
               car. A loner by nature, Hank was self-assured around men -- 
               either cocksure -- almost arrogant -- or totally withdrawn. 
               If he wanted to talk, the others would listen; if he didn't, 
               nobody could make him. "A lot of people didn't like Hank as 
               a person," recalled Lum York. "You had to be around him to 
               understand him."

               As Tilman and the others talk, Hank takes a scrap of paper 
               from his pocket, writes something on it, and tucks it away.

                                     TILMAN
                         ...that was like that crazy Irma-Lee 
                         Presswood, daughter of one of those 
                         Presswoods in Covington County by 
                         Gantt Lake where the bass are like 
                         to jump in the boat. You know those 
                         people, Hank?
                              (no answer)
                         Well, Irma-Lee had the pilot light 
                         turned up all the time. She could 
                         fling herself a cravin' on jus' about 
                         anythang whut could get itself in a 
                         male pair of pants. Jus' go walkin' 
                         like a young cat hound by the saw-
                         mill ev'ry day. Got to the point 
                         where her daddy had to do something -- 
                         or he's gonna have hisself some new 
                         inlaws. So he sent her off to New 
                         Or'lons where she went to a doctor, 
                         but it wasn't no reg'lar doctor...

                                     GOOD OLD BOY #1
                         A city doctor?

                                     TILMAN
                         No, worse. It was one of those pointy-
                         head doctors.

                                     GOOD OLD BOY #1
                         Shit, I never seen a reg'lar doctor.

                                     GOOD OLD BOY #2
                         That's why you're still alive.

                                     TILMAN
                         So this New Or'lons doctor said she 
                         was sick in the head. She was sick 
                         aw-right, but it weren't in the 
                         head...

               Hank, irritated about something, stands and walks over:

                                     HANK
                              (interrupting)
                         You boys gonna sit and chew all 
                         afternoon or are you gonna go out 
                         and get something to drink?

               They look at each other: they had instructions not to bring 
               along any booze.

                                     HANK
                         Well?

                                     TILMAN
                         I got me a Co-Cola.

                                     HANK
                         Tilman, I ain't know'd you to ever 
                         drink no Co-Cola.

               Sammy offers an explanation for the group:

                                     SAMMY PRUETT
                         You know how you get when you get to 
                         drinking, Hank. Go two, three days, 
                         sit with your paw, then have to go 
                         to the hospital to dry out and Miss 
                         Audrey says we're going to 
                         Nashville...

                                     HANK
                         Did Audrey tell you not to bring any 
                         beer?

                                     SAMMY PRUETT
                         She'an your mama hide my ass if you 
                         come back lickered up, Harm. You 
                         gonna cut those records. You don't 
                         want to screw that up, do you?

                                     HANK
                              (angry)
                         Are you telling me what to do, Sammy?

                                     SAMMY PRUETT
                              (cowed)
                         No, Hank.

               Hank looks accusingly at the others. They mumble denials: 
               "we ain't telling you nothing, Hank."

                                     HANK
                         I just wanted to make sure.

                                     GOOD OLD BOY #2
                              (volunteers)
                         Want us to get some beer, Hank?

                                     HANK
                         Nope. We're goin' up to Nashville to 
                         cut some sides tomorrow.
                              (heads toward car)
                         But don't tell me what I can't do. I 
                         just don't want a drink.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. LILLY'S BOARDING HOUSE - DAY

               Hank and Audrey's Chrysler, packed and ready to go, waits on 
               Katoma Street.

               Hank, wearing a white double-breasted suit and Stetson, 
               remembers something and crawls out of the back seat:

                                     HANK
                         I forgot to say goodbye to Momma.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LILLY'S BEDROOM - DAY

               Hank enters his mother's bedroom. Lilly, wreathed in her 
               black sack dress, is stretched out on the bed.

                                     LILLIAN
                         I wuz wonderin' if my son cared enough 
                         to say goodbye to his Momma.

                                     HANK
                         You feelin' aw-right, Momma?

                                     LILLIAN
                         My heart's real weak-like.

               Hank sits on the bed beside her:

                                     HANK
                         Don't worry. You're aw-right. Mr. 
                         Stone will look after you.

                                     LILLIAN
                         You don't forget your Momma when 
                         you're gone, do you Hiram?

                                     HANK
                         No, Momma. You don't have to worry. 
                         It won't be long you won't have to 
                         take in no laundry or boarders, you 
                         won't have to move again. I'm gonna 
                         be a big singer, Momma. The world's 
                         jus' about lonesome enough for Hank. 
                         Remember, every time you hear me 
                         sing on the radio or on a record, 
                         I'm singing every song for you.

               Hank's feelings for his mother are so confused that he has 
               no idea whether he is lying or telling the truth.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. FRED ROSE'S ATTIC - DAY

               Fred Rose moved a piano into his attic and used it as a 
               "studio." Fred could sit here alone by the hour, mull over 
               songs, or chew the fat with writers. It was here that many 
               of the Hank Williams songs were "written."

               Fred sits on the piano bench. Hank walks around pulling 
               various scraps of paper out of his many arrow-darted western 
               pockets.

               He places seven or eight pieces of paper on the piano top:

                                     HANK
                         I got some po'ms here, Pappy, I ain't 
                         too sure of. Some of them I've been 
                         singing, and they do work pratty 
                         well.

                                     FRED
                         Play a little something. Let's see 
                         how it sounds.

               Hank picks up the battered studio guitar and strums a few 
               bars.

                                     FRED
                         We've got the studio all morning 
                         tomorrow and I'd like to work out a 
                         few more songs.

                                     HANK
                              (walking around)
                         "I just don't like this kind of 
                         livin', When I..."
                              (starts over)
                         "I just don't like this kind of 
                         livin', Where you do all the takin' 
                         and I do all the givin'..."

               Fred plays a few basic chords on the piano. Hank stops; he 
               has something else on his mind. He picks up one of the scraps 
               of paper off the piano:

                                     HANK
                              (reading)
                         What do you think of this, Pappy? 
                         "Did you ever see a robin weep when 
                         the leaves turn to fly, I'm so 
                         lonesome I could die. I could cry."
                              (a beat)
                         Do you think anybody would understand 
                         that, Pappy?

               A sad look passes over Fred's face.

                                     FRED
                         I think so, Hank.
                              (plays piano)
                         You got some more, Hank?

               TIMECUT: Fred sits on the couch thinking. Hank strums the 
               Gibson on the piano bench. There is a knock on the door.

                                     FRED
                         Who is it?

                                     ROY ACUFF
                         Roy.

                                     FRED
                         Come on in.

               Roy Acuff, wearing a checkered coat and a tie, walks in 
               flashing the already famous Acuff smile.

                                     ROY ACUFF
                         Howdy, Fred, Hank. I was driving by 
                         so I thought I'd come in. Lurleen 
                         said it was aw-right to come on up.

               Fred and Roy may be good musicians, but actors they're not. 
               Roy has "dropped by" by pre-arrangement.

                                     FRED
                         Hank and I were working on some 
                         material we might cut tomorrow.

                                     ROY
                         Don't let me interrupt.

                                     FRED
                         No, I'd like you to hear some of 
                         this. All right, Hank?

                                     HANK
                              (flattered)
                         Sure.

               Hank slouches on the sofa with his guitar as Fred steps over 
               to the piano. After a few false starts, they begin a slow 
               version of "Move It On Over": "Came in last night half past 
               ten, That baby of mine wouldn't let me in, So move it on 
               over..."

               Before long, Acuff and Williams start swapping songs. When 
               Hank does a couple lines from "Wabash Cannonball," Roy returns 
               with "Honky-Tonkin." Hank turns to "Great Speckled Bird," 
               and Acuff follows with a line from "Move It On Over."

               The session closes with Fred and Hank doing a final run-
               through of "I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry": "Did you ever hear 
               a robin weep, When leaves begin to die, That means I've lost 
               the will to live, I'm so lonesome I could cry."

               As Hank finishes, alone and unaccompanied, tears drop from 
               his cheeks, spattering against the pale varnish of his Gibson 
               Sunburst. Fred and Roy watch silently, their emotions a 
               mixture of pity and awe.

               Hank finishes, wipes the tears from his cheeks, looks up and 
               says unemotionally:

                                     HANK
                         Well, whatja think?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. FRED ROSE'S HOUSE - DAY

               Fred and Roy wave as Hank drives off in Fred turns to walk 
               Roy back to his car:

                                     ROY ACUFF
                         That's a good boy, Fred. You gotta 
                         look out for him.

                                     FRED
                         I'd like to get him on one of the 
                         big radio shows. The Barn Dance, the 
                         Jamboree, maybe even the Hayride. 
                         The Opry won't touch him.

                                     ROY ACUFF
                         Cause of the drinkin' problem?

                                     FRED
                         Yeah. The boy's already got himself 
                         a real bad reputation. Worse than 
                         yours, boy.

                                     ACUFF
                              (laughs)
                         I got a problem, but I ain't got a 
                         reputation. There's a difference.

                                     FRED
                         He's been a drunk since he was about 
                         fifteen. Can't seem to moderate 
                         himself. Maybe if he gets a regular 
                         spot, he'll straighten out.

                                  THE LOUISIANA HAYRIDE

                                        Fall, 1948

               EXT. DOWNTOWN SHREVEPORT - DAY

               Cleveland and Boston are playing the third game of the World 
               Series on the car radio. One billboard promotes the 
               Truman/Barkley ticket. Another extolls the merits of Gov. 
               Earl Long.

               They pull up in front of the Commercial National Bank 
               Building, which housed the KWKH studios. Hank gets out of 
               the car and, in a characteristic mannerism, pops his shoulders 
               up and down before he ambles toward the door. Audrey follows.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KWKH STUDIOS - DAY

               Hank walks into the studio offices and looks around. A DJ 
               broadcasts live through a pane of glass. The SECRETARY catches 
               Hank's attention:

                                     SECRETARY
                         Can I help you?

                                     HANK
                         I'd like to speak to Henry Clay.

               The Secretary's tone of voice indicates that Mr. Clay is not 
               the sort of man to speak to any hillbilly who wanders in off 
               the street:

                                     SECRETARY
                         Do you have an appointment?

                                     HANK
                         My name's Hank Williams. I record 
                         for M-G-M Records. I've come from 
                         Montgomery to play on the Hayride.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. MUNICIPAL AUDITORIUM - EVENING

               A long line stretches around Shreveport's Municipal Memorial 
               Auditorium, a massive red-brick "WPA Deco" structure.

               It's Saturday night and they've come from miles around to 
               attend the Louisiana Hayride, country music's second largest 
               live radio show. Each week KWKH, a 50,000-watt clear channel 
               station, broadcast the Hayride live to every community from 
               San Antonio to Birmingham.

               The Hayride liked to call itself "The Cradle of the Stars." 
               The big boys at WSM's Grand Ole Opry just referred to it as 
               "the farm club." In either case, there's no doubt that many 
               of country music's biggest stars got their start as regulars 
               on the Hayride: Jim Reeves, Johnny Cash, Elvis Presley, Johnny 
               Horton, Faron Young, Red Souvine, Webb Pierce, Lefty Frizzell, 
               George Jones, David Houston, Kitty Wells -- and Hank Williams.

               And at 30? a seat, there was no hotter ticket in Shreveport 
               on a Saturday night.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LOUISIANA HAYRIDE - NIGHT

               Two thousand hillbilly fans fill the floor and double 
               balconies of the Municipal Auditorium. Shreveport is only a 
               "long spit" from Texas, and the Louisiana audience sports 
               more cowboy hats and boots then those in Alabama.

               On stage, a painted canvas backdrop bears the legend: "KWKH 
               Louisiana Hayride KWKH." The backdrop depicts a pastoral 
               scene: a red barn, a water pump, several trees, and a large-
               uttered cow. A large sign advertising JAX Beer (that segment's 
               sponsor) hangs above the performer's heads.

               Unlike the Opry, the Hayride did not have individual hosts 
               for each sponsor segment. The announcer would bring each act 
               for one song twice in the course of the show. If the act was 
               encored, it could do a second number. Since the attraction 
               of the Hayride was "exposure," not money, performers competed 
               fiercely for their encores.

               An air of anticipation fills the auditorium: this is the big 
               time.

               On stage, the Bailes Brothers conclude their best-known song, 
               "Dust on the Bible." The Bailes, from West Virginia, came 
               from a long tradition of rock-ribbed bluegrass groups such 
               as the Monroe Brothers, the Delmore Brothers and the Blue 
               Sky Boys. Their style was straight-forward, sentimental and 
               sacred in tone. When Hank Williams came to Shreveport, the 
               Bailes Brothers were the biggest act on the Hayride; today 
               they are remembered only by folk archivists.

               HORACE LOGAN, the announcer, helps the crowd give the Bailes 
               Brothers a hand as they walk off. The Jax Beer advertisement 
               is raised and replaced by one for Light Crust Flour.

                                     HORACE LOGAN
                         The Bailes Brothers ladies and 
                         gentlemen, Johnny, Walter and Homer.
                              (watches advertisement)
                         Now to begin the Light Crust Flour 
                         segment of the Louisiana Hayride, 
                         we'd like to bring out a Montgomery 
                         boy who's made quite a hit since 
                         coming to Shreveport. It's that 
                         "Lovesick Blues" boy and his Drifting 
                         Cowboys. And right now he's got 
                         himself a big hit on his hands for M-
                         G-M records, so come on out here 
                         Hank Williams and "Move It On Over!"

               The Drifting Cowboys assume their positions as Logan speaks. 
               Don Helms has left the group and BOB McNETT, a Pennsylvania 
               boy, has replaced Pruett at lead guitar. Lum York still wears 
               his baggy pants and plays bass fiddle.

               The Cowboys now wear matching brown western outfits. Audrey 
               is not on stage.

               There's a short pause, and Hank, dressed in a flashy white 
               suit and hat, ambles out on stage, swinging his guitar like 
               a club along side him. He wears a bright, hand-painted tie 
               and black boots with large red-and-yellow eagles stitched 
               across the front.

               He stops beside the painted cow, pretends to milk one of her 
               nipples, then dashes for the large KWKH mike. The audience 
               howls.

               Before the audience stops laughing, before he even reaches 
               the microphone, Hank bursts into the opening chords of "Move 
               It On Over." The song bears little resemblance to the slow 
               ballad Hank played in Fred's attic. It is now an up-beat, 
               hard-driving honky-tonk song: "She told me not to play around, 
               But I done let the deal go down, So pack it on over, tote it 
               on over, Move over nice dog, 'cause a bad dog's movin' in."

               The audience goes wild. Hank is rocking the huge auditorium 
               in the same way he rocked the roadhouses of South Alabama.

               Whether the crowd at the Hayride realized it or not, they 
               were watching the first wave of a music revolution: honky-
               tonk style had gone big time. The contrast between Hank and 
               the Bailes Brothers could not be more radical: Hank hunches 
               over the mike, popping his shoulder up and down and wobbles 
               his skinny legs back and forth.

               Allen Rankin, a Montgomery columnist, described it shortly 
               after Hank's death: "Hank didn't have much of a personality 
               except when he was singing. He'd come slopping and slouching 
               out on stage, but when he picked up the guitar and started 
               to sing, it was like a charge of electricity had gone through 
               him. He became three feet taller. He had a voice that sent 
               shivers up your spine and made the hair rise on your neck 
               with a thrill."

               Within eight years, the Hank Williams' style, emulated by 
               singers like Elvis Presley, Carl Perkins and Jerry Lee Lewis 
               would sweep the country under the name of "rock and roll."

               The audience cheers and cheers for more. Hank smiles and 
               looks from side to side. He loves it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. FIRST NATIONAL BANK OF SHREVEPORT - DAY

               Hank, his brown Stetson set back against his head, walks 
               into the bank. The sleeves of his blue western shirt are 
               rolled up; it has a yellow yoke with red-and-blue embroidered 
               flowers.

               INT. BANK - DAY

               Hank steps over to a young TELLER and hands her a check:

                                     HANK
                         I'd like to cash this, honey.

               She looks at the check, then back at Hank, discombobulated: 
               Hank already has quite a reputation in the Shreveport area.

                                     TELLER
                              (bashful)
                         I'll haff to get this okayed, Mr. 
                         Williams.

               The cashier has the check approved by her boss and returns.

                                     HANK
                         I'd like that in one dollar bills, 
                         if you don't mind.

                                     TELLER
                              (looks at check)
                         I don't think we carry that many 
                         singles, Mr. Williams.

                                     HANK
                         That's aw-right. I'll wait. How long 
                         will it take?

                                     TELLER
                         I reckon we could haff it by this 
                         afternoon.

               Hank nods.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BANK - DAY

               Later that day, Hank walks out of the bank with a small cloth 
               bag and throws it into the front seat of his shiny 1949 
               Packard. The top of the dark blue limousine is mounted with 
               two loudspeakers. The Cowboys will now be able to travel in 
               "comfort" and broadcast their shows as they go.

               Hank drives away.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. MODICA STREET HOUSE - DAY

               The blue Packard is parked outside Hank and Audrey's house 
               on Modica Street in Bossier City, Shreveport's twin city to 
               the east. Hank has moved twice since coming to Shreveport 
               four months before; as his fortunes have improved, so have 
               his living conditions. The Modica house is a modest three-
               bedroom ranch home with yellow awnings.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MODICA HOUSE - DAY

               Hank empties the cloth bank bag and spreads the dollar bills -- 
               thousands of them -- across the living room floor. The room 
               is decorated with department store furniture with a few 
               western touches: a sunset landscape, two mounted shotguns.

                                     HANK
                              (calling)
                         Audie, Audie!

               Audrey, wearing a plaid skirt and western shirt with a floral 
               yoke, enters and looks around in amazement:

                                     AUDREY
                         Hiram, what are you doing?

               Hank smiles like a naughty child:

                                     HANK
                         I got my first check for "Move It On 
                         Over."
                              (looks around room)
                         Five thousand one hundred and seventy 
                         dollars.
                              (kisses her)

                                     AUDREY
                         All in one dollar bills?

                                     HANK
                         I just wanted to see what it looked 
                         like, all at one time.

               Lycrecia, hearing the commotion, walks in.

                                     LYCRECIA
                         What's all this?

               Hank teasingly takes his step-daughter by the shoulder, wraps 
               his skinny arm around her neck and rubs his knuckles on the 
               top of her head.

                                     HANK
                              (teasing)
                         Hiya, Jughead. Whatja think?

                                     LYCRECIA
                              (not amused)
                         Stop it, Hank! That hurts.

               Hank sets Lycrecia free and she leaves the room, unimpressed 
               by the five thousand dollar bills.

               But nothing can dampen Hank's feelings. He wraps his legs 
               underneath him and squats on the floor in the middle of the 
               money. He takes his Stetson off and throws it on a chair. 
               His hair is visibly thinning.

                                     HANK
                              (almost to himself)
                         I wish Momma was here, now.

               He lets the money run through his fingers with child-like 
               wonder. Then thinking of something, he looks up at Audrey 
               and says seriously:

                                     HANK
                         Why doesn't she ever call me Daddy?

                                     AUDREY
                         Who?

                                     HANK
                         Lycrecia. We've been married four 
                         years and she never has called me 
                         Daddy or Dad.

                                     AUDREY
                         Gee, I don't know, Hank. I never 
                         thought of it that way. I'll tell 
                         her to start calling you "Dad."

                                     HANK
                              (goes back to money)
                         No, no. Don't tell her anything. Let 
                         her do as she wants.
                              (a beat)
                         I was jus' wonderin'.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. TEXARKANA - DAY

               Hank's blue Packard, pulling a matching trailer, drives down 
               Texarkana's "strip." The loudspeakers proclaim:

                                     PACKARD LOUDSPEAKER
                         ...Auditorium. That's Hank Williams, 
                         folks, the Lovesick Blues Boy, star 
                         of the Louisiana Hayride, and his 
                         Drifting Cowboys will be at the 
                         Arkansas High School Auditorium 
                         tonight at 8:00. Along with Hank 
                         will be the whole Hayride gang, 
                         including the Bailes Brothers, Johnny 
                         and Jack and Miss Kitty Wells. All 
                         for only 75? for adults, 35? for the 
                         kids. That's tonight at...

               INT. PACKARD - DAY

               Bob McNett is at the wheel. Beside him, another of the 
               Drifting Cowboys broadcasts over a hand mike.

               Hank, Lum and another Cowboy are stretched out in the back 
               seat. The limo has two radios; one on the dash, another on 
               the back of the front seat. Each plays a different football 
               game. The car is littered with the paraphernalia of boredom 
               and traveling: comic books, candy bar wrappers and a couple 
               of baseball mitts. M-G-M records are stacked in the rear 
               window.

                         I can't find Harvey Street.

               Hank, hunched over his guitar, strums to himself:

                                     HANK
                         "...lights all grow dim, And the 
                         dark shadows creep, And when your 
                         loved ones are gathered to weep..."

               Lum points and calls out:

                                     LUM YORK
                         There it is. KADO.

                                     HANK
                              (looking up)
                         Pull over, boy.

               McNett pulls to the curb.

                                     BOB MCNETT
                         Shall we wait, Harm?

                                     HANK
                         No, jus' go 'round broadcastin' some 
                         more. I'm just gonna see this ole 
                         boy and be out in fifteen minutes.

               Hank takes a 78 record out of the window and gets out of the 
               car. He straightens his brown striped western suit and walks 
               toward a two-story nondescript building. A folded copy of 
               Billboard, tucked in a back pocket, flops against his "gimly-
               ass" as he walks.

               He spots a liquor store, stops, goes back and enters.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KADO - DAY

               BILLY BOB, KADO's afternoon DJ, sits at the broadcast desk 
               as Hank enters. Moon Mullican's "Sweeter Than The Flowers" 
               plays over the studio monitors.

               A bottle of Dewer's Scotch sits on the counter next to the 
               MGM 78 record.

                                     BILLY BOB
                         Why thank you, Hank. Nice of you to 
                         stop on by.

                                     HANK
                         How's the coon huntin' been this 
                         year, Billy Bob?

                                     BILLY BOB
                         Didley-squat, but the pike's been 
                         just a jumpin' out on Texarkana Lake 
                         this year.

                                     HANK
                         Then we gotta go.

                                     BILLY BOB
                         I'll take Lydell's boat.
                              (interrupts)
                         Just a second.

               "Sweeter Than The Flowers" reaches its saccharine conclusion 
               and the DJ switches on the studio mike. Hank sits down beside 
               him.

                                     BILLY BOB
                         "Sweeter Than The Flowers," Moon 
                         Mullican on King Records number 673. 
                         Love that song. And it's available 
                         right through here, Radio Kay-do, K-
                         A-D-O, the Voice of Ark-La-Tex. Now 
                         I've got a real special surprise for 
                         you folks that just happen to be 
                         listenin' in this afternoon. Hank 
                         Williams who has that big hit "Move 
                         It On Over" out on M-G-M, available 
                         through Radio Kay-do, jus' happen to 
                         walk into the studio to say hello. 
                         Hank, if for some ignorant reason 
                         you hain't heard, will be playing at 
                         the high school auditorium tonight 
                         at 8:00. Hank, say hello to the folks.

                                     HANK
                         Howdy, friends and neighbors. Pleasure 
                         to be with you Billy Bob and the 
                         folks in Texarkana again.

                                     BILLY BOB
                         Hank, I wanted to ask you about that 
                         song you been singin' on the Hayride 
                         ev'ry Saturday that's got the folks 
                         all stirred up, "Lovesick Blues." Is 
                         that the record you brought by today?

                                     HANK
                         No, Billy Bob, I've been so busy 
                         playing the Hayride and going here 
                         and there to entertain folks I hain't 
                         taken time to put that "Lovesick 
                         Blues" on record yet. But I got a 
                         new one here, so new the wax hain't 
                         even dry yet, called "Mansion On The 
                         Hill," and me and the boys plan to 
                         be singing it tonight at the 
                         auditorium.

                                     BILLY BOB
                              (picks up record)
                         We'll play it for the folks in just 
                         a second, but I'll have to warn 'em 
                         first that this is a brand new record 
                         and we hain't got any copies yet at 
                         Radio Kay-do, but when it comes out, 
                         we'll be the first to git it fer 
                         you...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. KADO - DAY

               Hank walks out of the station and enters the waiting Packard.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. PACKARD - DAY

               They pull into traffic.

                                     BOB MCNETT
                         Let's go to the ho-tel.

                                     LUM YORK
                         I gotta git some real sleep.

                                     HANK
                              (nods)
                         You know that bastid up there, Billy 
                         Bob Cullum, what's the DJ here, you 
                         know what that asshole once told 
                         Henry Clay? He said, "That Hank 
                         Williams, he won't be such a big 
                         singer if it weren't for all them 
                         sad and morbid songs he sings." Well, 
                         look at this:
                              (pulls Billboard out 
                              of pocket)
                         "Move It On Over" Number Four on 
                         Billboard. Fuck him and the President, 
                         too. What does he know? He ain't 
                         worth the shot it'd take to send him 
                         to Hell. Number four on Billboard. 
                         People jus' like to spit behind your 
                         back.
                              (a beat)
                         Lum, turn that radio over to Kay-do 
                         and see if that prick's plugging our 
                         show.

               Hank, having said his piece, slouches back into the seat. 
               His little tirade draws no response from the Cowboys: they've 
               heard it all before.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. FRED ROSE'S ATTIC - DAY

               Hank slouches in his wrinkled white suit on Fred's sofa. He 
               crosses one spindly leg over the other, flashing his new 
               butterfly-emblazoned boots.

               Fred takes a few steps, scratches his head and says:

                                     FRED
                         It just ain't a hillbilly song, Hank. 
                         It ain't your kind of song. It's 
                         some Tin Pan Alley tune.

               Hank pushes his hat back so Fred can see his eyes.

                                     HANK
                         Look, Pappy, all I know is ev'ryware 
                         I go folks ask me for that goddamn 
                         "Lovesick Blues" and ev'ry time I 
                         sing it on the Hayride I get four or 
                         five encores. Hell, I could throw my 
                         hat out on stage and get an encore. 
                         You tell me I shouldn't cut a song 
                         like that?

                                     FRED
                              (in Yankee innocence)
                         But it ain't country. If you record 
                         that song, Hank, I won't go in the 
                         studio with you. You'll have to cut 
                         it alone.

                                     HANK
                         I may just do that.
                              (pause)
                         Did you talk to Stone?

                                     FRED
                         About the Opry? I don't think it's 
                         much use, Hank.

                                     HANK
                         What do they want from me? I have 
                         been fully straight the last five 
                         months. Ask anybody in Shreveport. I 
                         hain't had but four or five drinks, 
                         I never missed a show, I never did 
                         no cuttin' up 'cept the one time I 
                         ran the curtain down on the Bailes 
                         and ev'rybody know'd that was a joke.
                              (pleading)
                         Pappy, I'll crawl on my belly from 
                         Bossier City to be on the Opry.

                                     FRED
                         I'll try again. Maybe we'll get a 
                         guest slot.

                                     HANK
                         Get me a chance. You know I kin whup 
                         'em. I've been real good in 
                         Shreveport. Even on the road. Just 
                         ask somebody.

                                     FRED
                         I know.

                                     HANK
                         You do?

                                     FRED
                         I talk to Henry Clay on the phone.

               Hank takes his hat off and brushes his hair back.

                                     HANK
                              (exonerated)
                         See, I tol' ya.

               Fred notices something on the back of his head.

                                     FRED
                         What you got on the back of your 
                         head?

                                     HANK
                              (sensitive)
                         Don't joke about my hair.

                                     FRED
                              (looks closer)
                         You got a big cut there, Hank.

                                     HANK
                              (shakes his head)
                         Oh, it's that Audrey. She done conked 
                         me one. Took one of those lamp things 
                         and jus' conked me right square 
                         backside the head.

               Fred goes to the piano bench and looks over some bits of 
               paper Hank has laid out. Even though he is the only person 
               beside Lilly Hank could confide in, Fred knows better than 
               to pry into his life. If Hank wants some advice, he'll ask.

                                     HANK
                              (awkward)
                         Maybe you can hep me, Pappy.

                                     FRED
                         How?

               Hank fumbles for the right words:

                                     HANK
                         It's this music thing again. Audrey 
                         wants a music contract.

                                     FRED
                         But she can't sing.

                                     HANK
                         You know that, I know that, but try 
                         tellin' her. She'll jus' haul off 
                         and whop you one. She can make a 
                         feller's life pretty rough. She wants 
                         to sing with me on stage, on radio. 
                         You could get her a contract, Pappy. 
                         I'll pay for it.

                                     FRED
                         I'll talk to Paul Kohn at Decca. He 
                         owes me a favor. Maybe we can work 
                         it out.

                                     HANK
                         Now that she's pregnant, it don't 
                         make things any easier.

               Fred turns around, startled. A boyish grin spreads across 
               Hank's face.

                                     FRED
                         Audrey's pregnant?

                                     HANK
                         Yep.

                                     FRED
                         How many months?

                                     HANK
                         Four.

                                     FRED
                         You never told me.

                                     HANK
                         You never asked.

               Fred, happy for Hank, walks over to him:

                                     FRED
                         Congratulations, Hank.

               Hank, blushing, stands as Fred takes both his hands.

                                     FRED
                         You're gonna be a father, Hank. You 
                         finally made it.

                                     HANK
                              (bashful grin)
                         Yep, been throwin' a lot of pitches, 
                         Pappy. Finally got one across the 
                         plate.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. KWKH STUDIOS - DAY

               Hank's Packard and trailer are parked outside the eleven-
               story white Commercial National Bank Building at the corner 
               of Market and Texas. In 1948, the KWKH studios were on the 
               second floor.

               INT. KWKH STUDIOS - DAY

               The Louisiana Hayride section closes with an abbreviated re-
               creation of the "Johnny Fair Show," Hank's morning radio 
               show. The 15-minute morning radio show was a staple of 
               southern life for over fifty years. The show's format was 
               fixed by time-honored convention: it mattered little who was 
               the host or sponsor, or what city it was broadcast from.

               The large clock reads 6:15 inside the small broadcast studio. 
               The red light flashes "On The Air."

               The Drifting Cowboys, looking worn and tired, stand in front 
               of an advertisement for Johnny Fair Syrup. Audrey, wearing a 
               new cowgirl outfit, stands with them.

               The SOUND ENGINEER signals Hank and he steps up to the mike 
               and says:

                                     HANK
                         "When I die bury me deep, 
                         In a bucket of Johnny Fair 
                         From my head to my feet.
                         Put a cold biscuit in each of my 
                         hands 
                         And I'll sop my way to the Promised 
                         Land."

               Hank speaks in his radio voice, a slow, friendly drawl:

                                     HANK
                              (continuing)
                         Good mornin', friends and neighbors, 
                         this is the old Syrup Sopper Hank 
                         Williams for Johnny Fair. I hope 
                         you'all done et your biscuits this 
                         morning 'cause if you hain't, well, 
                         I'll talk about that later. First, 
                         let's start it off with a song. This 
                         here's a new tune I recorded for M-G-
                         M records 'bout a po' feller who got 
                         a invitation. It's a sad, pathetic 
                         sort of little song and I hope you 
                         never have to go through anything 
                         like this. Me and the boys have to 
                         do it quite often. Boys, let's give 
                         'em a little "Wedding Bells Will 
                         Never Ring For Me":
                         "I have the invitation that you sent 
                         me, 
                         You wanted me to see you change your 
                         name, 
                         I couldn't stand to see you wed 
                         another, 
                         But dear I hope you're happy just 
                         the same."

               As Hank wraps a shortened version of "Wedding Bells", the 
               Cowboys burst into applause. Hank is a natural salesman. He 
               was selling patent medicines from the back of a flat-bed 
               truck when he was 14, and has been selling something or other 
               ever since.

                                     HANK
                              (back at the mike)
                         Why, thank ya very much. Those old 
                         wed-ding bells. The other morning me 
                         an' the Cowboys was on the road and 
                         I was watchin' Lum York, he's the 
                         short feller over here what plays 
                         the bass fiddle, I was watchin' Lum 
                         et his breakfast. And ol' Lum would 
                         take a biscuit right in his hand and 
                         then bore a big hole right in the 
                         middle of it with his thumb. Then 
                         he'd set that biscuit down and fill 
                         it up with that delicious Johnny 
                         Fair Syrup. It jus' looked so good I 
                         couldn't stop myself, and between us 
                         we et up all those biscuits -- and I 
                         can taste 'em yet. Um-mm. And sticks 
                         to yer bones, too. 'Specially when 
                         you're on the road so much like me 
                         and the boys. Tonight we'll be over 
                         at Rob's Place in Robstown, Texas. I 
                         know that's a mighty long spit from 
                         hereabouts, but if you've got any 
                         friends down that way, you might 
                         tell 'em Old Hank's coming down 
                         tonight to do some pickin' and 
                         singin'.
                              (looks at clock)
                         Lookin' up at that old clock, I can 
                         see it's time to move along. Right 
                         now I'd like to bring out a young 
                         lady that can sing mighty fine -- 
                         and pretty too. I think you know who 
                         I'm talkin' about, Miss Audrey. Hello, 
                         Audrey.

               Hank and the Cowboys applaud as Audrey joins Hank at the 
               mike.

                                     AUDREY
                         Howdy, Hank.

                                     HANK
                         I think you folks know Audrey's my 
                         wife, but you may not know, she's 
                         also the mother of a big baby boy. 
                         That's right, me an' Audrey had a 
                         boy a couple weeks back and I'm mighty 
                         proud.
                              (the Cowboys applaud)
                         Audrey's gonna join me an' the boys 
                         to sing a tune I wrote a little while 
                         back. Some folks like to think I 
                         write this song for this one, or 
                         that song for that one, but I don't 
                         write 'em for anybody particular. I 
                         just write 'em to be writin' 'em. 
                         The title of it is "If You Mind Your 
                         Own Business You Won't Be Mindin' 
                         Mine":

               Audrey and Hank crowd around the mike. Fred is right: Audrey's 
               singing is godawful. Her timing is wrong, her voice off-key.

               Despite their many quarrels, despite Audrey's singing, it's 
               clear Hank loves her. And the words of his song leave no 
               doubt what anybody else can do about it:

               "If the wife and I start fussin', Brother, that's our right, 
               Cause me and that sweet woman's got a license to fight.

               Why don't you mind your own business, Cause if you mind your 
               own business, You won't be mindin' mine."

               FADE OUT TO A TITLE READING:

                                    THE GRAND OLE OPRY

                                       Summer, 1949

               EXT. RYMAN AUDITORIUM - EVENING

               A long line of patrons stretches down Fifth Avenue waiting 
               to get into the Saturday Night Opry. It's a hot summer night, 
               but no one seems to mind. They've waited, saved and planned 
               for months to come to the Grand Ole Opry.

               The red-and-white brick facade of the Ryman Auditorium has a 
               stately, righteous quality about it, and, in fact, the Ryman 
               was built in 1892 as a revival tabernacle. WSM's "Grand Ole 
               Opry" show, which had outgrown two previous homes, moved to 
               the Ryman in 1941.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. RYMAN AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

               The Grand Ole Opry is an entertainment phenomenon. In 1949, 
               two hundred thousand persons paid to travel and wait in line 
               to watch a radio show. They sat on hard pews in an uncooled 
               sweatbox and bought hand fans decorated with advertisements. 
               They watched a show constantly interrupted by commercials 
               and played in front of billboard-like advertisements. The 
               artists who attracted these crowds were paid scale: $30 a 
               week. Yet no one complained: the artists were proud to belong; 
               and the patrons, like good guests, were polite and cleaned 
               up after themselves. It was -- and continues to be, in 
               Opryland -- a near perfect money-making machine.

               The three-hour Saturday night Opry was divided into twelve 
               15-minute segments, each with a separate host and sponsor. 
               Each host sang three songs and introduced three guests, 
               usually a comedian, a singer and a bluegrass group. Each act 
               was pre-timed for air time requirements, and the whole show 
               ran like clockwork.

               On stage, Roy Acuff and his Smoky Mountain Boys are pickin' 
               and grinnin '. Roy balances the bow of his fiddle on his 
               nose and a few rebel cheers go up from the "Confederate 
               Gallery" (balcony). In 1949, country music and the Opry were 
               still "hillbilly": the audiences were younger, poorer and 
               openly chauvinistic. There was no Opryland, no Music Row and 
               no national image to worry about.

               EXT. RYMAN AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

               A cheer goes up from the crowd inside. Hank, Audrey, Fred 
               and Wes Rose walk up Fifth and turn into the alley beside 
               the Ryman.

               Audrey wears a two-piece suit with a pleated skirt. Hank, 
               nervous, carries his guitar case and glances at his watch.

               They stop at the backstage door.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. RYMAN AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

               Backstage is bedlam. The Ryman was never intended as a concert 
               auditorium; there are only three closet-sized dressing rooms 
               for the fifty-plus performers who appear on Opry night. 
               Artists stand in every possible spot, tuning their 
               instruments, checking their appearance and swapping small 
               talk. One object brings order to this chaos: the typed 
               schedule which states which artists appear in which show at 
               what time.

               Hank, Audrey, Wes and Fred elbow their way through the crowd. 
               Most of the artists nod hello to Fred, a few recognize Hank.

               Fred introduces Hank to JIM DENNY, manager of the Opry. Denny 
               says a few words and moves on.

               Hank takes out his guitar and finds a nook in which to wait.

               ON STAGE, the painted "Prince Albert Tobacco" backdrop is 
               lowered signaling the Red Foley 9:00-9:15 segment. The Stoney 
               Mountain Cloggers, a square dance team dressed in gingham 
               and plaids, do bluegrass turns as GRANT TURNER, the announcer, 
               introduces the Prince Albert segment.

               To the right of the stage, behind a glass window, WSM 
               technicians monitor the broadcast. On stage, the atmosphere 
               is intentionally informal. Performers walk back and forth 
               setting up their instruments. Friends of WSM and the 
               performers sit in two pews against the backdrop. A large 
               clock -- time is critical -- hangs on the side of the 
               announcer's podium.

               RED FOLEY, dressed in a dark suit and light Fedora, steps 
               out, introduces his Cumberland Valley boys and starts to 
               sing "Tennessee Saturday Night."

               BACKSTAGE, Hank nervously puffs on a cigarette. The bare 
               lightbulb on the low ceiling is just inches above his head.

                                     AUDREY
                         Are you nervous?

               Hank shakes his head. Audrey straightens his hand-painted 
               tie.

                                     AUDREY
                         You'll do fine.

                                     HANK
                         It's just another show.

               Minnie Pearl's familiar voice echoes from the stage:

                                     MINNIE PEARL (O.S.)
                         ...I've got to go now, but you know, 
                         Red, a long time ago, the first time 
                         I got Brother to town, all t'other 
                         boys got to pointin' at him. "What's 
                         wrong with that ole boy, he got the 
                         Small Pox? He's got spots all over 
                         his face." "No," I says, "We jus' 
                         been teachin' him how to eat with a 
                         fork!"

               The Cumberland Valley Boys "fiddle" Minnie off stage as the 
               audience applauds.

               Hank snuffs out his cigarette and pulls his tie off-center.

                                     RED FOLEY (O.S.)
                         Now I'd like to bring out an Alabama 
                         boy from down Montgomery way. This 
                         boy hasn't been on the Opry before, 
                         but he's got a pretty big song on 
                         his hands, "Lovesick Blues." Come on 
                         out, Hank Williams!

               Hank walks out on stage. His new white western suit glistens 
               in the footlights. His hat is pulled tight against his 
               forehead.

               There is a polite smattering of applause, then it dies out. 
               Nobody knows who he is.

               Hank looks back to the band and they strike up "Lovesick 
               Blues."

                                     HANK
                         "I've got a feelin' called the blu-
                         oo-oo-oo-ues, Oh Lord, Since my baby 
                         said good-bye..."

               The audience responds in a roar, then a standing ovation. 
               They knew the song, but not the singer. Hank's eyes flash 
               and his thin lips break into a smile as his nervousness 
               disappears. He buckles his knees, leans into the mike and 
               begins to sway: "I don't know what I'll do-oo-oo, Oh Lord, 
               All I do is sit and cry..."

               TIMECUT: Finishing the song, Hank walks off stage to a massive 
               ovation and cries of "More!" Fred wildly signals Hank to 
               turn around. Foley calls him back for an encore.

               The applause is undiminished. All Hank can do is sing 
               "Lovesick Blues" again.

               TIMECUT: Hank walks off again, but the audience won't let 
               him go. Foley has to call him back on stage.

               TIMECUT: the Sound Engineer stands in the booth, pointing to 
               his watch. All Foley can do is shrug.

               TIMECUT: ten minutes later, the audience is still calling 
               for another encore. Grant Turner, Jim Denny and the Sound 
               Engineer are all gathered around the podium, trying to figure 
               out how to get Hank off stage.

               Finally, as Hank leaves, Foley walks out and tries to wave 
               the crowd quiet. He is only partially successful. He shouts:

                                     RED FOLEY
                         That's wonderful folks. My, my. We've 
                         got to keep the show going.
                              (many shouts of protest)
                         Alright, folks, we'll bring him out 
                         here one more time. Hank, come over 
                         here, boy.

               Hank, who has already removed his double-breasted jacket and 
               loosened his tie, walks out in his sweat-stained shirt. Foley 
               tries to calm the crowd:

                                     RED FOLEY
                         My, my, you created quite a stir, 
                         boy. I can't right remember anybody 
                         getting five encores. Got the sponsors 
                         all agitated. You know any other 
                         songs, Hank?

                                     HANK
                         Yeah, I do, Mr. Foley. But I think 
                         I'll just stick with this one here.

               The crowd goes wild again and Foley steps back:

                                     RED FOLEY
                         All right then, take it away.

               Hank, on top of the world, leans over and lets out a long 
               throbbing wail which brings the house down:

                                     HANK
                         "I've got a feelin' called the blu-
                         oo-oo-ues, O Lord..."

               It is June 11, 1949. Oldtimers say it was the most memorable 
               night in the Grand Ole Opry's history until Richard Nixon 
               came to the opening of Opryland in Spring, 1974.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. FRANKLIN ROAD HOUSE - DAY

               Hank and Audrey have moved into a red brick ranch house on 
               Franklin Road. Although the house is not the "estate" Audrey 
               claimed, it certainly ain't a shack either.

               A new yellow Cadillac convertible stands in front.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

               Hank's new success as an Opry star has allowed he and Audrey 
               to indulge their whims. Hank's taste ran to things like guns, 
               horses and spacious cars; Audrey's gaudy jewelry, furs and 
               oriental decor. Hank's fantasies were fulfilled by icons of 
               the "West,"; Audrey's by symbols of the "East" -- New York 
               and Tokyo.

               Hank, Audrey and Lilly stand in the newly-decorated living 
               room. Audrey wears a forties dress with a diamond brooch, 
               Hank blue western slacks and a loose shirt.

               The decor is simply awful. Nouveau riche, unauthentic, 
               inorganic -- all the words which make designers wince. The 
               carpet is pink, the piano white, the curtains black with a 
               yellow-and pink oriental pattern. Chinese figurines and 
               miniature trees stand on the mirrored mantel and bookshelves.

               Lilly, wearing her black sack with a lace insert, looks like 
               she's stepped off on the wrong planet. Audrey shows her a 
               porcelain figure of a Chinese dancer:

                                     AUDREY
                         This dancer is over two thousand 
                         years old -- not really this dancer, 
                         but this kind.

               Lilly looks around, impressed. Hiram has made the big time.

                                     HANK
                         Come out here, Momma, and look at 
                         this.

               Hank opens the front door for her.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. FRANKLIN ROAD HOUSE - DAY

               Hank walks Lillian over to the new Cadillac.

                                     HANK
                         Four thousand bucks. I bought it for 
                         Audrey.
                              (opens door)
                         Go on, Momma, sit inside.

               Hank and Lilly sit in the back seat of the open Cadillac. 
               Hank, happy as a little kid, puts his blue leather boots up 
               on the front seat. Lillian seems a little worried:

                                     LILLIAN
                         Hiram, can you really afford all 
                         this?

                                     HANK
                         Don't worry. Audie takes care of 
                         everything.

               That's exactly what worries Lilly.

                                     LILLIAN
                         She's spending a lot of money.

                                     HANK
                         I'm makin' a lot, Momma. I'm big 
                         now. We get $600 a show, four shows 
                         a week plus two nights at the Opry. 
                         Plus the records and song rights. I 
                         got $1200 in my pocket right now.
                              (gestures)
                         I'm livin' in high cotton.

                                     LILLIAN
                         I just don't think it's right. All 
                         this, and your poor Momma still 
                         running a little boarding house.

                                     HANK
                         You don't have to do that.

                                     LILLIAN
                         No, no, waste not, want not, the 
                         Lord says. There's a bigger place 
                         for sale on McDough Street. If I had 
                         that house...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Audrey rocks the baby as Hank sets his suitcases and guitar 
               out for the next morning. Lilly walks toward the bedrooms:

                                     LILLIAN
                         I'm going to bed now, Hiram. Audrey.

                                     AUDREY
                         Goodnight.

                                     HANK
                         Night, Momma. I'll be gone by five 
                         in the morning.

                                     LILLIAN
                         I'll be up. I wouldn't miss that.

               Lilly hesitates a second, then walks off. Audrey waits for 
               the bedroom door to close.

                                     AUDREY
                         Hank, I have to talk to you.

                                     HANK
                         What?

                                     AUDREY
                         Did you give your Momma any money?

                                     HANK
                              (lying)
                         No, Audrey.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Lilly lies in the darkened bedroom listening.

                         You're a goddamn liar, Hank Williams.
                              (a beat)
                         Don't walk off. Stay in here.

                                     HANK (O.S.)
                         I'll do what I damn please.

                         Like Hell you will. Besides, I hid 
                         the liquor what was in your room. 
                         How much did you give her, Hank?

               EXT. JUSTICE OF THE PEACE - DAY

               It's morning. Fred Rose drives his blue Cadillac into Lake 
               Charles, a Cajun town of 50,000 in Southwestern Louisiana.

               Fred pulls up to a house with a sign reading "R. Thibodaux, 
               Justice of the Peace." Don Helms and JERRY RIVERS, a crewcut 
               boy about 18, tired and still wearing their Drifting Cowboy 
               outfits, meet Fred as he gets out of the car.

                                     FRED
                         Hello, Don.

                                     DON HELMS
                         Hank's been bent for a couple days, 
                         Mr. Rose.

                                     FRED
                         Can he continue on tour?

                                     DON HELMS
                         He wasn't in shape to come out at 
                         all last night. Then later, he got 
                         to claimin' he was George Morgan.

               Fred shakes his head as he walks inside with Don and Jerry.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. JUSTICE OF THE PEACE - DAY

               Hank sits mildly beside a uniformed Police Officer in the 
               small office. His white fringed jacket with blue piping and 
               rhinestones is wrinkled and dirty.

               The JUSTICE OF THE PEACE looks up as Fred enters.

                                     JUSTICE OF THE PEACE
                         Mr. Fred Rose?

                                     FRED
                         Yes.

                         George Morgan.

                                     FRED
                         Yes.

                                     JUSTICE OF THE PEACE
                         Are you willing to take custody of 
                         Mr. Williams?

                                     FRED
                         Yes.

               Hank starts singing George Morgan's hit, "Candy Kisses":

                                     HANK
                         "Candy kisses, wrapped in paper, 
                         Mean more to you than my love, 
                         dear..."

                                     JUSTICE OF THE PEACE
                         Mr. Williams.

               The Police Officer removes Hank's cowboy hat and stands him 
               up.

                                     JUSTICE OF THE PEACE
                         Calcasie Parrish hereby fines you 
                         $100 for Disturbing the Peace and 
                         remands you to the custody of Fred 
                         Rose, of Acuff-Rose.

               Fred pays the Justice as Don and Jerry take Hank out the 
               door. The Justice of the Peace takes a hundred dollar bill 
               from his desk and gives it to Fred.

                                     JUSTICE OF THE PEACE
                         You better take this. Mr. Williams 
                         gave it to me this morning. I didn't 
                         want to see him get in any more 
                         trouble.

                                     FRED
                         You're an honest man, your honor.

                                     JUSTICE OF THE PEACE
                         No, just smart. He was giving them 
                         out to everybody last night.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. JUSTICE OF THE PEACE - DAY

               Fred meets up with Hank, Don and Jerry outside. Fred walks 
               with Hank for a couple steps before saying anything:

                                     FRED
                         You didn't last very long, did you 
                         Hank?

                                     HANK
                         Me and this ole boy was working on a 
                         tune last night, Pappy. You want to 
                         hear it?

                                     FRED
                         No.

               Hank pulls up his sleeve and tries to make out the words 
               scribbled over his shirt cuff.

                                     HANK
                         It goes like this. Let's see...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. KENTUCKY LAKE - DAY

               Hank and VIC McALPIN, 29, a song-writer, sit "nigger fishing" 
               in a small rowboat. Hank is wearing jeans, a fancy western 
               shirt and his baseball cap.

               Hank sets his pole down and turns toward Vic:

                                     HANK
                         McAlpin, whatja think of this?

                                     VIC
                         What?

               Hank stands and paces across the rocking boat.

                                     HANK
                         Here's the story. This ole boy and 
                         his gal have split up. He ain't seen 
                         her for a bit. Then, he's walking 
                         down the street and he sees her 
                         comin'. "Today I passes you on the 
                         street," he says. What comes next?

                                     VIC
                         You're rocking the boat.

                                     HANK
                         What comes next?

                                     VIC
                              (thinking)
                         "And I smelled your rotten feet?"

                                     HANK
                         No, boy.

                                     VIC
                         "And I beat my meat?"

                                     HANK
                         Christ, boy, you got a foul mind.

                                     VIC
                         Sit down, Harm. You're gonna flip 
                         this thang.

                                     HANK
                         It's my back. I can't sit still long. 
                         It starts hurtin'.
                              (to himself)
                         "Today I passed you on the street."

                                     VIC
                         Did you come to fish or did you jus' 
                         come to watch the fish swim by?

                                     HANK
                         Hey, that's good, Vic.

                                     VIC
                         What?

                                     HANK
                         "Did you come to watch the fish swim 
                         by?" What comes after that? Let's 
                         see...

                                     VIC
                         "I went to the river to watch the 
                         fish swim by..."

                                     HANK
                         "I went down to the river to watch 
                         the fish swim by, but the river was 
                         dry..."

               Vic is now up on his feet pacing too. Seen from the distance, 
               they stand walking in the boat, both animatedly talking and 
               gesturing.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CASTLE STUDIOS - DAY

               WSM's live radio shows originated from Castle Studios in the 
               Tulane Hotel, which seated 200 persons. These shows, usually 
               fifteen minutes long, featured a mixture of songs, jokes, 
               folksy talk and relentless commercial plugs. They were known 
               just by the name of the sponsor: the Jefferson Island Show, 
               the Martha White Show, the Royal Crown Cola Show.

               Hank's show, the Mother's Best Show, aired every morning 
               from 7:15-7:30. (When traveling, which was all the time, 
               Hank and the Cowboys would record four or five shows at a 
               time.)

               A Mother's Best Enriched Flour advertisement is tacked against 
               the sound-proofed wall behind the band. Sacks of Mother's 
               Best Cow Feed, Hog Ration, Laying Mash and Growing Mash are 
               set out for the audience to see.

               Hank, at the mike, wears his new western jacket, a pale blue 
               gabardine with a navy suede fringe and switched collar. Behind 
               him, wearing checkered slacks, white shirts and ties, are 
               the latest version of The Drifting Cowboys: Don Helms, steel 
               guitar; Jerry Rivers, fiddle; Bob McNett, lead guitar; and 
               HILLOUS BUTTRAM, bass fiddle and comedian.

               Audrey, standing with the boys, wears a dark two-piece cowgirl 
               outfit with white fringe. Rhinestone "A" 's are stitched 
               along the hem and yoke.

               Hank looks at LOUIS BUCK, the announcer:

                                     HANK
                         Thank you, Cousin Louis, for those 
                         wise words about new "phosphated" 
                         Mother's Best Flour.

               Hank looks at the clock as Don starts a soft wail on the 
               steel guitar, indicating that:

                                     HANK
                         Friends, it's hymn time on the show, 
                         the time when me an' the boys gather 
                         'round the mike, take our hats off, 
                         and do one of the old hymns. This 
                         morning I'd like to do a song I wrote 
                         a while back. It's one of those "Mama" 
                         songs everyone seems to like so well, 
                         and rightly so. I'm going to ask 
                         Miss Audrey and the boys to help me 
                         on the chorus. We're gonna do a song 
                         I wrote a while back. There's a lot 
                         of meaning in this song and it's 
                         called, "Take a Message to My Mother."

               The steel guitar intros and Hank leans over the mike. He 
               does not remove his hat:

               "The tears and sorrow I have caused her, How I wish I could 
               repay, But tell her I'll be waiting for her, We'll meet in 
               heaven some glad day.

               Audrey and the boys crowd round for the chorus. Hank leans 
               closer to minimize the sound of Audrey's voice:

               "Take this message to my mother, It will fill her heart with 
               joy, Tell her that I've met my Saviour God has saved her 
               wanderin' boy."

               FADE OUT TO A TITLE READING:

                                      THE OPRY TOURS

                                       Summer, 1950

               The "Opry Tours" section is a montage of people, places and 
               events interwoven with the words and lyrics of "Ramblin' 
               Man."

               "I can settle down and be doin' just fine, 'Til I hear an 
               old train rollin' down the line, Then I hurry straight home 
               and pack.

               And if I didn't go I b'lieve I'd blow my stack, I love you, 
               Baby, but you gotta understand, When the Lord made me He 
               made a Ramblin' Man."

               -- A new green Cadillac, pulling a silver tear-drop trailer, 
               speeds down a two-lane highway.

               -- Hank and the boys arrive in a small Midwestern town in 
               the afternoon and stop in front of the main hotel.

               -- Hank, wearing a new grey outfit with red fringe, performs 
               in an auditorium with the Drifting Cowboys.

               -- Three in the morning. The Cowboys pack their instruments 
               into the trailer outside the auditorium. Hank curls up on 
               the back seat.

               -- The Cadillac limousine speeds through the night.

               INT. ADOLPHUS HOTEL - AFTERNOON

               The Cowboys, car-sore, straggle into the Adolphus Hotel in 
               downtown Dallas. Jerry Rivers talks to the DESK CLERK.

                                     JERRY RIVERS
                         We're with Hank Williams.

               The Clerk checks the register:

                                     DESK CLERK
                         I'm sorry. There's no Hank Williams 
                         registered here.

                                     JERRY RIVERS
                         That's impossible.
                              (calls Don Helms)
                         Hey, Don, they ain't got Hank 
                         registered here.

               LATER, the Cowboys stand in the lobby beside their 
               instruments, not quite sure what to do. The HOTEL DETECTIVE 
               walks over to them:

                                     HOTEL DETECTIVE
                         You boys lookin' for Hank Williams?

                                     DON HELMS
                         Yeah.

                                     HOTEL DETECTIVE
                         The singer?

                                     JERRY RIVERS
                         He's supposed to be here.

                                     HOTEL DETECTIVE
                         He checked in alright. He's up in 
                         room 506. He's using another name. 
                         Herman P. Willis.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ADOLPHUS HOTEL ROOM - DAY

               Don knocks on the door to room 506. Hank, drunk and bleary-
               eyed, wearing his undershirt, opens the door.

                                     DON HELMS
                         Hank, what the shit you doin'? You 
                         scared us.

                                     HANK
                         What do you want?

                                     DON HELMS
                         Let us in.

               Don and Jerry push their way in.

                                     HANK
                         Who you lookin' for?

                                     JERRY RIVERS
                         You. Hank Williams.

                                     HANK
                         I don't know anybody by that name. 
                         I'm Herman P. Willis.

               They both look at him: he's serious.

                                     JERRY RIVERS
                         Com'on, Hank.

                                     HANK
                         What are you talkin' about? Who's 
                         this Hank Williams?

                                     DON HELMS
                         He's a singer who's gotta sober up 
                         so he can do a show at eight tonight.

                                     HANK
                         Never heard of him. I'm Herman P. 
                         Willis.

                                     DON HELMS
                         If you ain't Hank Williams, then how 
                         come you're wearin' his gun belt?

                                     HANK
                         Huh?

               Don turns Hank's black hand-tooled gun belt with double 
               holsters around so he can see the large inscription, "Hank 
               Williams." Hank seems befuddled.

                                     HANK
                         This ain't mine.

                                     DON HELMS
                         We're in real trouble, Mr. Willis. 
                         This Hank Williams is supposed to 
                         perform tonight. Do you think you 
                         could fill in for him?

                                     HANK
                         Maybe.

               Don and Jerry relax; Hank's starting to come around. Helms 
               picks a fifth of Jack Daniels off the bureau and pours it 
               down the drain.

                                     DON HELMS
                         What's the "P" stand for, Hank?

                                     HANK
                              (arrogant)

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. DALLAS AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

               An unhappy ANNOUNCER looks at his watch and walks to the 
               mike. Behind him the DRIFTING COWBOYS wrap up an instrumental. 
               He looks over the large crowd:

                                     ANNOUNCER
                         I want to thank you good folks for 
                         waiting to see this man. He hasn't 
                         been feeling too good...

               A voice calls from the audience:

                                     HECKLER
                         You mean he's drunk!

                                     ANNOUNCER
                         ...not feeling so well, but he's 
                         going to make it anyway
                              (a loud cheer goes up)
                         and I'm sure he won't...

               The Announcer turns and sees why the cheer has gone up: Hank, 
               tired and a little groggy, strolls out on stage. His coat is 
               wrinkled and his tie loose. He gives the band no time for 
               its usual fanfare.

                                     HANK
                         Thank you, hoss.
                              (turns to Jerry)
                         Burrhead, give me that guitar.

               Hank takes the guitar from Rivers and slips the strap around 
               his neck. The Cowboys look worried: Hank doesn't even seem 
               to know where the audience is.

               But this is just part of his act. Rivers breathes a sigh of 
               relief as Hank tugs his hat down an inch, stands in front of 
               the mike and tightens his knees.

                                     HANK
                         Howdy, friends. They tell me you 
                         good folks been waiting four hours 
                         to see Old Hank. I appreciate it. I 
                         hain't been feelin' too well...

                                     HECKLER
                         You mean you've been drunk!

               Hank looks over the audience then points out the Heckler:

                                     HANK
                         Did you folks come to hear him or 
                         me?

               Many cries of "You, Hank."

                                     HANK
                         Then would somebody get a shovel and 
                         some sand and move that out of here?

               Ten burly farm boys climb from their seats and drag the 
               Heckler out of the auditorium.

               The audience loves it. Hank's antics only add to his 
               popularity.

                                     HANK
                              (satisfied)
                         I wanna do a little tune I jus' wrote, 
                         then me an' the boys will play 
                         whatever you want for as long as you 
                         want.
                              (cheers)
                         This one's about a fella whut's in 
                         love with a woman with a "Cold, Cold 
                         Heart." Boys, get me started.

               Hank closes his eyes, grits his teeth and sets into a soulful 
               moan that makes "the hair grab at the back of your neck."

                                     HANK
                         "I tried so hard, my Dear, to show 
                         that you're my ev'ry dream, You're 
                         afraid each thing I do is just some 
                         evil scheme. A mem'ry from your 
                         lonesome past keeps us so far apart, 
                         Why can't I free your doubtful mind 
                         and melt your cold, cold heart..."

               The audience listens in rapt silence. "You could hear a pin 
               drop when Hank was working," Little Jimmy Dickens said 
               wistfully, "He just seemed to hypnotize those people."

                                                                    CUT TO:

               -- Strains of "Ramblin' Man" blend with those of "Cold, Cold 
               Heart."

               -- The long, green Cadillac speeds through the night.

               INT. CADILLAC LIMO - DAY

               Hank hunches over his Martin, writing and humming to himself.

               The car hits a pothole and Hillous, at the wheel, cusses:

                                     HILLOUS BUTRUM
                         Goddamnit all.

               Hank looks up and says sharply.

                                     HANK
                         That tears it, Mule. Pull over. Right 
                         up here.
                              (gestures)

               Hillous pulls in front of a country store and Hank walks out 
               and goes in.

               A MOMENT LATER, he returns with an empty cigar box. He gets 
               back in without saying anything as he cuts a hole in the top 
               of the box. Hillous drives back onto the road.

               Hank shows the boys the box.

                                     HANK
                         I don't want to hear any more cussing 
                         or taking the Lord's name in vain. 
                         Anybody whut does has got to put two-
                         bits in the box.

                                     DON HELMS
                         Which words you mean, Harm?

                                     HANK
                         You know, any that use the Lord's 
                         name.

                                     DON HELMS
                         How'bout other words? My mouth ain't 
                         no prayer book, you know.

                                     HANK
                         There's two words I don't like to 
                         hear.

                                     HILLOUS BUTRUM
                         I know "shit" is one of them.

               Hank recoils as if struck by a stick.

                                     HANK
                         Ooh, don't say that word, Mule.

                                     DON HELMS
                         What's the other one?

                                     JERRY RIVERS
                         Does it start with F?

               Hank does not answer.

                                     DON HELMS
                         Is it "fuck?"

                                     HANK
                         Ooh, ooh, Shag -- don't say that 
                         word!

               Hank gives the box to Jerry and settles against the seat 
               with a triumphant air.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               -- Hank sits backstage somewhere working on a song. His hat 
               is pulled over his eyes and his legs are folded atop each 
               other. He looks like a man wrapped in his own cocoon.

               -- A GUN SHOP OWNER shows Hank a pair of pearl-handled 
               revolvers.

               -- Hank makes a long distance call from his hotel room. There 
               is no answer.

               -- It's late afternoon and the Caddy speeds down those never-
               ending roads. Hank, pissed and a little drunk, makes a crack 
               from the back seat. Hillous quickly turns around and hands 
               him the cigar box. Hank pulls out a five-dollar-bill and 
               stuffs it in as if to say, "So there."

               EXT. MADISON HOSPITAL - NIGHT

               Don Helms drives the Cadillac through the gates of the 
               "Madison Hospital" and stops in front.

               Hank, wedged between Hillous and Jerry in the back seat, is 
               dead to the world.

                                     DON HELMS
                         Harm, we're home.

               Jerry shakes Hank.

                                     HANK
                              (waking up)
                         Huh, you said we wuz gonna git 
                         sumptin' to eat. We gotta play 
                         already?

                                     JERRY RIVERS
                         We ate six hours ago. We're back in 
                         Nashville.

               Hank, very drunk, looks out his window:

                                     HANK
                         This ain't home. Let me alone.

                                     JERRY RIVERS
                         Com'on, Hank. We're getting out.

               Jerry nods to Hillous who helps him pull Hank out of the 
               car. Hank looks around and recognizes the hospital.

                                     HANK
                         Oh no, it's the hut. No sir, you 
                         hain't takin' me to the fuckin' hut. 
                         I won't go.

                                     DON HELMS
                         I called Audrey. She said not to 
                         bring you home in bad condition. 
                         Jus' to bring you straight here.

               Two white-coated HOSPITAL ATTENDANTS walk toward them. Don 
               nods to the first. The Hospital Attendant takes Hank's arm.

                                     1ST HOSPITAL ATTENDANT
                         Com'on, Mr. Williams. Let's get some 
                         sleep.

                                     HANK
                              (pleading)
                         Burrhead, Mule, don't let 'em take 
                         Old Hank. Not to the hut again, 
                         please.

               The Attendants pull Hank off as Don calls:

                                     DON HELMS
                         See you tomorrow, Harm.

               The Cowboys turn and get back into the Cadillac.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. FRANKLIN ROAD HOUSE - DAY

               Hank, Audrey and the Drifting Cowboys pose for publicity 
               photos in the pasture behind Hank and Audrey's house.

               The Cowboys, wearing black western shirts and white ties, 
               lean to their right against the white slat fence. Hank and 
               Audrey stand at the end of the row. Hank wears his brown 
               double-breasted, white Stetson and a broad grin.

               The STILL PHOTOGRAPHER takes several shots. Hank poses on 
               his quarter-horse, Hi-Life. He rides around a bit, then holds 
               his back and grimaces in pain. Don and Audrey help him 
               dismount.

                                     HANK
                         Dam that back.
                              (to photographer)
                         Let's git a picture of Bocephus. 
                         Where's that boy? Get Miss Raglin, 
                         hon.

               Audrey walks back to the house.

               Hank poses with his chubby 1 1/2-year-old son. Hank Jr. wears 
               jean overalls and a 99? plastic guitar around his neck. There 
               was never a more bewildered child -- nor a prouder father.

               MISS RAGLIN, the stout governess, watches in her white 
               uniform.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. FRANKLIN ROAD HOUSE - DAY

               Hank stands in the KITCHEN with Don and Jerry. The kitchen 
               and breakfast nook are lined with the latest copper-plated 
               built-ins: dishwasher, oven, stove.

               Hank taps out a tune on the counter top:

                                     HANK
                         "...If you're lovin' me like I'm 
                         lovin' you, BA-BY, we're really in 
                         love..."

               Don laughs.

                                     HANK
                         Go 'head and laugh, hoss, you jus' 
                         watch. We'll sell a million songs.

               Hank hears Audrey, Bob and Hillous walk in.

                                     HANK
                         Com'on into the living room. I got a 
                         suprise for you.

               Hank, Don and Jerry walk into the living room and join the 
               others.

                                     HANK
                              (to Audrey)
                         Get Bocephus. I want him to hear 
                         this.

               Hank takes an MGM 78 out of a drawer and puts it on the Hi-
               Fi. The Cowboys sit on the sofa as Audrey and Miss Raglin 
               walk in with Hank Jr.

                                     HANK
                              (calling)
                         Lycretia! Jugghead, git on in here.

               Audrey sits on the piano bench with Hank Jr. as Lycretia, 
               now 10, joins them. Hank turns on the record player.

                                     HANK
                         Listen to this!

               There's a scratchy silence, followed by a lush string 
               orchestration and the melifluous voice of Tony Bennett: "I've 
               tried so hard my dear, to show you're my every dream..." To 
               any lover of Hank Williams and country music, Bennett's 
               schmalzy pop "cover" seems like the worst sort of 
               bowdlerization, but Hank didn't see it that way. It was proof 
               that he was more than a hillbilly writer -- his songs had 
               "crossed over."

                                     HANK
                         Pappy got Columbia to cut "Cold, 
                         Cold Heart." Listen to that. Tony 
                         Bennett doin' one of Hank's songs. 
                         Isn't that something?
                              (to Hank Jr.)
                         Fred says if this is popular, I can 
                         sell more songs. Old Hank's done 
                         crossed over. Ain't that the damndest 
                         thing?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. RYMAN AUDITORIUM - EVENING

               The faithful wait in line for the Saturday Night Opry.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. RYMAN AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

               Red Foley stands in front of the Prince Albert "The National 
               Joy Smoke" backdrop and introduces:

                                     RED FOLEY
                         "...I think you all know who I'm 
                         talkin' about, 'The Gossip of 
                         Grinder's Switch,' Cousin Minnie 
                         Pearl!"

               Minnie bustles out wearing her familiar puffed sleeves, pouch 
               bag and straw hat with a $1.69 tag.

                                     MINNIE
                         How-dee! I'm so proud to be here...

               BACKSTAGE, Hank sits in one of the closet-sized dressing 
               rooms with HANK GARLAND and COWBOY COPAS. Red and Minnie's 
               voices occasionally echo backstage.

                                     HANK
                         Whatja think of this, Copas? I've 
                         been thinkin' 'bout writin' something 
                         for you to record:
                              (sings)
                         "If you're lovin' me like I'm lovin' 
                         you, Baby, we're really in love, If 
                         you're happy with me like I'm happy 
                         with you, Old Cupid just gave us a 
                         shove..."

               Copas listens with great interest. Although 48-years-old, 
               Cowboy Copas has just had his first hit and would love to 
               record a Hank Williams song. Hank Garland was then one of 
               the masters of country guitar. It's apparent from their 
               attitudes that Hank already commands the respect of his elders 
               at the Opry.

                                     COPAS
                         That's great, Hank.

               Hank pulls a whiskey "miniature" out of his boot and takes a 
               swig. He offers a drink to Copas, who accepts.

                                     HANK
                         You like it, boy, it's yours.

                                     COPAS
                         I think maybe you should work in 
                         some more instrumentation. A few 
                         guitar licks. Garland, show 'im some 
                         "Fingers on Fire."

               Garland just laughs, but Hank takes it personal.

                                     HANK
                         You think that fast-fingered shit is 
                         so great? Here, I'll show you some 
                         real pickin'.

               Hank opens the door and calls into the crowded backstage 
               area.

                                     HANK
                         McNett, git on over here.

               Bob McNett breaks away from the other Cowboys and walks in.

                                     HANK
                         This here's Bob McNett. Got him off 
                         a mountain in Pennsylvania. McNett, 
                         this is Cowboy Copas and Hank Garland.

               McNett is impressed -- and worried. Hank is unpredictable.

                                     HANK
                         Play a little "Sally Goodin," boy.

                                     BOB MCNETT
                              (embarrassed)
                         I've only been playing lead for a 
                         year, Mr. Garland. I'm not really...

                                     HANK
                         Don't give us that. Play it.

               McNett, scared shitless, plays a few rudimentary chords. He 
               makes no attempt at frills -- he's not good enough to impress 
               anybody.

               Hank stands and turns triumphantly to Copas and Garland.

                                     HANK
                              (points to McNett)
                         See that, Copas, now there's a boy 
                         who can play country and play all 
                         the notes at the same time.

               Hank turns and walks out, leaving McNett to apologize.

               ONSTAGE, Red looks at the clock and says to Minnie:

                                     RED FOLEY
                         Now, Minnie, I'd like to bring an 
                         old friend of ours out here, and a 
                         mighty popular one he is too. It's 
                         that tall drink of water from 
                         Montgomery, Alabama, Hank Williams!

               Hank waits a moment for effect, pulls his tie to the side, 
               and strolls out.

               Flashbulbs flare from every part of the auditorium as a cheer 
               goes up. Opry visitors dash to the stage, take snapshots and 
               go back to their seats. Lewis Crook, the Opry's oldest member, 
               recently recalled that "it was Hank that started the flashbulb 
               and screamin' thing. There wasn't too much of it before him."

                                     HANK
                         Howdy Red, Minnie.

                                     MINNIE PEARL
                              (mock-spoony)
                         Oh, there's that Hank Williams.
                              (to audience)
                         Don't he look like something?

                                     HANK
                         You're pretty good lookin' yerself, 
                         Minnie. For two cents I'd just haul 
                         off an' kiss you.

                                     MINNIE PEARL
                         Anybody got change for a nickel?

               Minnie makes a big show of puckering up, and Hank, blushing, 
               leans over and pecks her on the cheek.

               The crowd loves it -- and most of all the women. They watch 
               with open mouths and "bedroom eyes." Many of Hank's 
               mannerisms, the blushing, the crooked tie, the rocking and 
               moaning, were calculated to appeal to the ladies. "The sexual 
               thing was there alright," Minnie Pearl later said, "but most 
               of the women just wanted to mother him." Hank turns to the 
               audience with his little boy smile.

                                     MINNIE PEARL
                         Wait 'til they hear 'bout this at 
                         the Switch.

               The Cumberland Boys strike up as Minnie runs offstage.

                                     RED FOLEY
                         I hear you've been doin' some 
                         travelin', Hank?

                                     HANK
                         That's right. We've been out to the 
                         midwest part of the country. Oklahoma, 
                         Iowa, Michigan, Ohio.

                                     RED FOLEY
                         Some mighty fine folks out that way.

                                     HANK
                         That there are, Red.

                                     RED FOLEY
                         What song they been askin' for lately, 
                         Hank?

                                     HANK
                         Well, mostly Red, they've been asking 
                         for that new song I've put out on 
                         the M-G-M label called "I Can't Help 
                         It If I'm Still in Love With You."

                                     RED FOLEY
                         Well, don't let me stop you.

               Foley steps aside as the Drifting Cowboys hit the opening 
               chord.

                                     HANK
                         "Today I passed you on the street, 
                         And my heart fell at your feet, I 
                         can't help it if I'm still in love 
                         with you..."

                                                                    CUT TO:

               -- The lyrics of "I Can't Help It" turn again to those of 
               "Ramblin' Man":

               "Some folks might say that I'm no good, That I wouldn't settle 
               down if I could But when that open road starts to callin' 
               me, There's somethin' o'er the hill that I gotta see.

               Sometimes it's hard but you gotta understand, When the Lord 
               made me, He made a ramblin' man."

               -- Hank's Cadillac and trailer speed across a wide expanse 
               of desert.

               -- Hank sits in the back seat jotting notes on scraps of 
               paper. Tears roll down his cheeks.

               INT. HANK'S ROOM - ROSSMORE HOTEL - DAY

               Hank, sitting on the edge of the bed, talks over a bad long 
               distance connection:

                                     HANK
                         Hello, Momma?
                              (a beat)
                         It's Hiram. I'm in Los Angeles.
                              (a beat)
                         That ain't so. I've been singing 
                         every night. You must not of been 
                         home. Have you seen little Bocephus?
                              (a beat)
                         Don't go saying that. How you been?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ROSSMORE HOTEL HALLWAY - DAY

               NUDIE Cohn, 48, Hollywood's "Rodeo Tailor," walks toward 
               Hank's room. Although Nudie became a character in his own 
               right in later years, affecting outlandish styles of "western" 
               dress, in 1950 he was just a transplanted Brooklyn schneider 
               trying to make a buck.

               CHARLIE SANDERS, a private guard hired by WSM, stands at the 
               door to Hank's room.

                                     NUDIE
                         Hi, Charlie. Hank in?

                                     CHARLIE SANDERS
                         Yep.

                                     NUDIE
                         Hank wanted to talk about some clothes 
                         and go for a ride.

                                     CHARLIE SANDERS
                         Okay, I'll tell him. Now, he's gonna 
                         be in your keepin', Nudie. If he 
                         shows up drunk or causes any trouble, 
                         you're gonna have to answer to Mr. 
                         Denny.

                                     NUDIE
                         We're just gonna drive around.

                                     CHARLIE SANDERS
                         Okay.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. ROSSMORE HOTEL - DAY

               Hank and Nudie get into Nudie's white 1950 Hudson (with water 
               buffalo horns on the hood) and drive off. Hank wears a 
               wrinkled western shirt and dark Stetson.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. NUDIE'S CAR - DAY

               Hank turns to Nudie:

                                     HANK
                         Nudie, last night I wuz working on 
                         this song. I thought it might be 
                         good for Little Jimmy Dickens. What 
                         do you think of this:
                              (beats tune on dash)
                         "If you're lovin' me, like I'm lovin' 
                         you, Baby we're really in love."

                                     NUDIE
                         You can't fool me, Hank. You already 
                         recorded that song.

                                     HANK
                         What do you mean?

                                     NUDIE
                         I heard it on the radio.

                                     HANK
                         Oh. Well, what do you think of this...

               Hank starts to beat another tune on the dash when he sees a 
               store out the window.

                                     HANK
                         Pull up over here, hoss, I want to 
                         get myself some Co-Cola.

               Nudie slows down and looks at the small market.

                                     HANK
                         It's just a reg'lar market. They 
                         don't sell no booze. My mouth's dry.

                                     NUDIE
                              (pulls to curb)
                         Alright.

                                     HANK
                         I'll be right back.

               Nudie waits a moment while Hank runs inside and buys a six 
               pack of Coke.

               Hank gets back into the car and they head out Sunset toward 
               the ocean. Hank opens a Coke on the "horseshoe" door handle 
               and takes a drink:

                                     HANK
                         I swear, boy, you're about as sus-
                         picious as that goddamn Audrey.

                                     NUDIE
                         I don't want to get WSM on my ass.

                                     HANK
                         Don't worry about them.

                                     NUDIE
                         How is Audie?

                                     HANK
                         Awh, I tried to call her again.

               Hank looks away, despondent.

                                     NUDIE
                         She gone out again?

                                     HANK
                         What business is it of yours?

                                     NUDIE
                         Who's asking?

                                     HANK
                         It don't take much to stay around 
                         the house, would you think, boy? Is 
                         your wife always out?

                                     NUDIE
                         It ain't my business, Hank.

                                     HANK
                         Damn straight.

               Hank opens a second Coke and takes a long swig.

                                     NUDIE
                         You want to meet some girls tonight? 
                         Audrey don't have to be the only 
                         one.

                                     HANK
                              (testy)
                         You saying something against Audrey?

                                     NUDIE
                         Nope.

                                     HANK
                         If anybody says anything against 
                         her, it'll be me. That bitch.

                                     NUDIE
                         What's she got for you?

                                     HANK
                         She's the only one I care about. 
                         These squirrels don't do shit for 
                         me.
                              (opens another Coke)
                         Audie taught me everything. When I 
                         met her I was just a boy. I'll tell 
                         ya, when I ain't with her I miss her 
                         so much it's almost as bad as being 
                         with her.
                              (maudlin)
                         Her and little Hank.

               Hank has started to slur his words. Nudie sniffs the air and 
               looks over. Hank props his knees against the dash and pushes 
               his hat over his eyes.

                                     NUDIE
                         You feelin' alright, Hank?

                                     HANK
                         Yeah, why?

                                     NUDIE
                              (suspicious)
                         Could I have a sip of your Coke?

               Hank finishes the bottle.

                                     HANK
                         It's empty.

                                     NUDIE
                         Open another for me, Hank.

                                     HANK
                         It ain't much good. We'll save it 
                         for later.

               Nudie pulls to the side of the road and opens one of the 
               cola bottles.

                                     HANK
                         What you doing?

               Nudie takes a swig and spits the contents out the window.

                                     NUDIE
                         Shit. What is this? Half rot-gut?

                                     HANK
                              (innocent)
                         What are you talking about?

                                     NUDIE
                         You know what. This here's more booze 
                         than soda. How the hell you get this?

               Hank reaches in his shirt pocket and pulls out several large 
               bills.

                                     HANK
                         Here you go, boy. Let's go to some 
                         hamburger joint.

               Nudie tosses the remaining bottles out the window. Hank 
               watches them a moment, then pulls his hat over his eyes and 
               curls up.

                                     HANK
                         Jus' leave me alone. Why can't anybody 
                         do that?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. RIVERSIDE RANCHO - NIGHT

               In the late Forties and early Fifties, the Riverside Rancho 
               was the country and western club, a watering hole for Cliffie 
               Stone and Spade Cooley and a must waystop on every major 
               tour.

               The room is packed from wall-to-wall. Eager young faces hang 
               over the stage, their wide eyes fixed on their idol. Sammy 
               Pruett has rejoined the band, replacing Bob McNett.

               Hank sports his new Nudie outfit -- a white doublebreasted 
               suit with large black quarter notes down the legs, sleeves 
               and across the yoke -- as he rips through the last chorus of 
               "Howlin' at the Moon":

               "I know there's never been a man in the awful shape I'm in, 
               I can't even spell my name, my head's in such a spin, Today 
               I tried to eat a steak with a big old tablespoon, You got me 
               chasin' rabbits, walkin' on my hands and howlin' at the moon.

               LATER, Hank is standing with Nudie and the MANAGER by the 
               door. A SNUFF QUEEN eyes him from across the room. He turns 
               to the Manager and says secretively:

                                     HANK
                         Hey, boy, who is that filly whut's 
                         been givin' us the bedroom eyes?

                                     MANAGER
                         Com'on, I'll introduce you.

               The Manager leads Hank across the room and introduces him.

               LATER, Hank pulls Jerry aside:

                                     HANK
                         Burrhead, I'm going up the road a 
                         piece to a place called the Court 
                         Motel. Get the boys and pick me up 
                         in about a half hour.

               Jerry shrugs and nods.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. COURT MOTEL - NIGHT

               The Cowboys, silent and tired, wait in the Cadillac outside 
               the Court Motel.

               After a moment, a door slams. They all turn.

               Hank dashes from a bungalow putting on his shirt and 
               straightening his half-cocked hat.

               The Snuffie, wearing only a bra and panties, stands in the 
               door behind him.

                                     SNUFF QUEEN
                         You fuckin' one-way bastard!

               Hank jumps in the car.

                                     HANK
                         Let's git.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CADILLAC LIMO - NIGHT

               Hank and the boys ride along silently. Nobody knows what to 
               say.

               Finally, Jerry breaks the silence:

                                     JERRY RIVERS
                         What all was that, Hank?

                                     HANK
                         Nothing.

                                     DON HELMS
                              (teasing)
                         What you mean, nothing? Some Snuffie 
                         comes running after you in her 
                         underthings. What did you do to her?

                                     HANK
                         I didn't do nothing.

                                     DON HELMS
                         That's cause 'nuff right there.

                                     HANK
                         Go ahead. Get funny, Shag.
                              (pause)
                         That was a very crazy girl. I didn't 
                         know what she was doin'.

               Everyone's curious now.

                                     HANK
                         We go into this motel, you know, and 
                         she takes her clothes off. I take my 
                         clothes off and we fool around a 
                         little bit. Then, just when we was 
                         going to make love, she crawls right 
                         up on me and shoves her pussy right 
                         in my face. I didn't know what the 
                         fuck she wanted, so I got my ass 
                         out.

               It takes a little while for this to sink in. Jerry ventures 
               a comment:

                                     JERRY RIVERS
                         Well, Hank, you kinda like it when a 
                         woman does that to you, you know, 
                         goes down on you?

                                     HANK
                              (thinks)
                         Yeah?

                         Well, maybe women like that too.

                         I never quite looked at it that way.

               INT. BALTIMORE HIPPODROME - DAY

               Strains of "Ramblin' Man" are heard as a long line waits in 
               front of the Hippodrome. A large sign proclaims:

               The Cowboys, wearing their stage clothes, sit around an

                         "I'm goin' back to the wagon. These 
                         shoes are killin' me."

               INT. HALL/BALTIMORE HOTEL - DAY

               Jim Denny confronts Sanders outside a hotel room.

                                     CHARLIE SANDERS
                         I checked everything, Mr. Denny. It 
                         just seems like he can get drunk 
                         leaning out the window. I took his 
                         guns.

               Audrey walks down the hall toward them.

                                     JIM DENNY
                         Hello, Audrey. Sorry to ask you to 
                         fly up here like this. It isn't right 
                         for audiences to see an Opry star 
                         like this. He hurts the whole Opry. 
                         And we can't drop him 'cause he's 
                         the headliner.

                                     AUDREY
                         Let me talk to him.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HANK'S ROOM/BALTIMORE HOTEL - DAY

               Hank jumps up as soon as he hears Audrey at the door. He 
               grabs the bottle of Dewar's from the table, takes a swig and 
               stashes it in the toilet tank.

               Hank is fiercely drunk -- out of control, unlike anything 
               we've seen before. His eyes veer erratically from left to 
               right, spittle drips from his mouth. "It didn't take much to 
               put him out of commission," Sammy Pruett recalls, "I've seen 
               him drunk to where he couldn't even hold water in his stomach. 
               He'd be foaming at the mouth like a goddamned mad dog."

               To anyone unfamiliar with the extremes of alcoholism, it is 
               a terrifying sight. Jim Denny's jaw drops as he opens the 
               door. Audrey just grimaces; she's been through this before. 
               Hank staggers toward them. He has little idea where he is or 
               what he's doing.

                                     AUDREY
                         Hiram! What are you doing?

                                     HANK
                              (to Denny)
                         Why you bring her to me? Why can't I 
                         get out of my room?
                              (to Audrey)
                         They got me locked up, Audie, like 
                         some animal.

                                     AUDREY
                         How you been getting the booze?

                                     HANK
                         What are you doing here? Where's my 
                         boy, where's Bocephus? What you done 
                         with him?

                                     AUDREY
                         He's at home, Hank.

                                     HANK
                         You whore! How come you're never 
                         home? Do I have to have every DJ 
                         telling me about some picker who's 
                         been a-screwin' my wife? Pulling out 
                         the back seat of the car and going 
                         into the woods.

               Audrey doesn't hesitate: she hauls back and takes a swing at 
               him.

               Hank grabs her by the throat and starts choking. Audrey's 
               screams bring the Cowboys running in from the next room.

               Sanders pulls Hank away from his wife's throat. Audrey rubs 
               her neck as she staggers toward Denny. Jerry just stares: 
               "It was a shock to all of us in the band because none of us 
               had seen him drunk for a long while. But he was as bad that 
               time as I ever saw him later."

                                     AUDREY
                              (to Denny)
                         It's just the liquor talking. There's 
                         nothing I can do.

               Denny turns to the band as Sanders wrestles Hank to the bed.

                                     JIM DENNY
                         There's no use trying to get him in 
                         shape. Take him back to the hospital 
                         in Nashville.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. MADISON HOSPITAL - NIGHT

               As Hank's Cadillac and trailer pull up the drive to Madison, 
               we hear the sounds of "Ramblin' Man" echoing from a distance. 
               There is no other sound:

               "I love to see the towns a-passing by And to ride these rails 
               'neath God's blue sky.

               Let me travel this land from the mountains to the sea, 'Cause 
               that's the life I b'lieve He meant for me.

               And when I'm gone and at my grave you stand, Just say God's 
               called home your ramblin' man."

                                   THE HADACOL CARAVAN

                                        Fall, 1951

               The Hadacol Caravan was the strangest and most extravagant 
               traveling variety show in American history. In August and 
               September of 1951, Louisiana State Senator Dudley LeBlanc 
               assembled a menage of performers and show-biz types to promote 
               Hadacol, his 24-proof cure-all and elixer.

               The Hadacol regulars included Dick Haymes and the Tony Martin 
               Orchestra, Cesar Romero, Jack Dempsey, Carmen Miranda, Minnie 
               Pearl, Ted Evans ("The Tallest Man in the World"), Emile 
               Parra ("The Man Who Skates on His Head"), Sharkey's Dixieland 
               Band, the Chez Paree chorus line, colored comics Pork Chops 
               and Kidney Stew, Candy Candido ("The Man of a Thousand 
               Voices") -- and Hank Williams and the Drifting Cowboys. 
               Special one-night guests included Milton Berle, Bob Hope, 
               Mickey Rooney, Burns and Allen, Jimmy Durante and Arthur 
               Godfrey.

               The sales of Hadacol ($1.25 for eight ounces) had begun to 
               lag and "Couzan Dude" devised the "Caravan Good Will Tour" 
               to revive interest. The show traveled on a seventeen-car 
               train supplemented by six trailer trucks through Louisiana, 
               Georgia, North Carolina, Kentucky, Ohio and Iowa, until, in 
               Dallas, LeBlanc ran out of money and called the whole thing 
               off. Admission was one Hadacol box-top.

               Few of the performers were actually paid the money promised 
               them, but, looking back, none regret joining the Caravan. It 
               was the last medicine show, the last vaudeville tour, the 
               first variety program -- and one hell of a good time.

               Hadacol also marked a turning point in Hank Williams' life. 
               He was at the height of his career and popularity (making 
               upwards of $1200 a night). Hadacol proved he wasn't just a 
               hillbilly singer, but a national star. His act overshadowed 
               those of TV and movie entertainers like Hope and Berle. His 
               songs were covered on the pop charts by artists like Bennett, 
               Rosemary Clooney, Frankie Laine and Jo Stafford.

               Yet success only aggravated Hank's insecurity and paranoia. 
               During the Hadacol days, he let his marriage and friendships 
               fall apart, established a reputation as a no-show, and became 
               increasingly dependent on drink.

               EXT. THIBODAUX STREET - DAY

               The Hadacol section begins August 16th on the main street of 
               Thibodaux, Louisiana. On arriving in each new town, the 
               Caravan sent its performers and equipment down the main drag 
               to advertise that night's show.

               An odd assortment of Packards, DeSotos and Cadillacs lead 
               the way. Alongside walk chorus girls, clowns, magicians and 
               a cowboy doing rope tricks. A midget and Ted Evans, the 7'3? 
               giant, wear signs identifying themselves as "Before" and 
               "After" consuming Hadacol. The Dixieland band follows, playing 
               the "Hadacol Boogie." Six tractor trailers bearing the legend 
               "Hadacol: Men-Women-Children" and a calliope bring up the 
               rear.

               Hank, Don and Jerry sit in back on an open DeSoto bearing a 
               sign reading, "Hank Williams and the Drifting Cowboys." Hank 
               waves to the crowd.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THIBODAUX AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

               The banner above the stage reads: "Hadacol for a Better 
               Tomorrow." Two large cardboard cut-out bottles of Hadacol 
               flank the stage.

               Clowns work their way through the crowd, keeping everyone in 
               a festive mood. One clown, dressed as a policeman, carries a 
               large bottle of Hadacol. Every time he takes a drink, his 
               glasses light up.

               The Chez Paree girls dance off stage as the HADACOL ANNOUNCER 
               steps out.

                                     HADACOL ANNOUNCER
                         Couzan Dudley LeBlanc and the folks 
                         at Hadacol are proud to continue the 
                         Good Will Caravan. Coming up tonight 
                         we have Dick Haymes, Carmen Miranda, 
                         Cesar Romero, Hank Williams, Minnie 
                         Pearl, and George Burns and Gracie 
                         Allen. A little later in the tour 
                         such nationally known entertainers 
                         as Bob Hope, Milton Berle and Jimmy 
                         Durante will be joining the Caravan. 
                         I'd like to take just a second to 
                         read a testimonial about Hadacol, 
                         the dietary supplement to give you 
                         pep, strength and the energy of 
                         bouyant health. An 80-year-old man 
                         from Mississippi writes: "I was 
                         disable to get over a fence, disable 
                         to get up out of a chair without 
                         help, but after I took eight bottles 
                         of Hadacol, I can tie my own shoes 
                         and feel like I can jump over a six-
                         foot fence and getting very sassy"...

               BACKSTAGE, Hank, Jerry and Hillous are sitting with ROCHESTER, 
               Jack Benny's sidekick, and one of the Chez Paree girls.

                                     HILLOUS
                         "Eight bottles!" I'm surprised the 
                         old codger ever came down.

               Hank slouches back in a folding chair, his hat low on his 
               forehead. His eyes pan up the long legs of the plumed 
               showgirl. She gives him a flirtatious wink.

                                     JERRY
                              (to Hank)
                         You riding back with us tonight, 
                         Hank?

                                     HANK
                         Nah, Burrhead, I'm gonna fly back 
                         with Minnie and Henry. My back's 
                         botherin' me again. This plane ridin' 
                         is the best thing ever happened. I 
                         should buy me one of those things.

                                     ROCHESTER
                         You boys drive back to Nashville 
                         tonight?

                                     JERRY
                         Yeah, Rochester. Hank's gotta go to 
                         the Saturday Night Opry.

                                     HILLOUS
                         Get off this here merry-go-round for 
                         a day.

               The Hadacol Announcer's voice grows louder:

                                     HADACOL ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
                         And here's a boy you all been waiting 
                         for. The number one hillbilly artist 
                         in America today...

               Hank and the boys get ready.

                                     HADACOL ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
                         ...The Lovesick Blues Boy, Hank 
                         Williams!

               Don and Sammy crowd around as they prepare to go out. Hank 
               turns to them:

                                     HANK
                         Let's hit 'em real hard tonight.

               Hank gives a final wink to the chorus girl and walks ON STAGE.

               Hank steps up to the mike and limbers his shoulders.

                                     HANK
                         Thank you, cousins. Couzan Dude been 
                         taking me 'round your part of the 
                         country here, and I've got mightly 
                         partial to it. Went out t'other day -- 
                         after we'd had our Haddycol --
                              (laughter)
                         to a picnic and a goat killin'. And 
                         I wrote a song about it. Little tune 
                         I call "Jambalaya On the Bayou":

               The crowd starts cheering and doesn't seem to stop.

                                     HANK
                         "Goodbye, Joe, me gotta go, me oh my 
                         oh, Me gotta go pole the piroque 
                         down the bayou, My Yvonne, the 
                         sweetest girl, me oh my oh, Son of a 
                         gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou."

               A LITTLE LATER, Hank and the Cowboys walk backstage to a 
               thunderous applause.

               They immediately start packing their gear. DICK HAYMES waits 
               for the cheering to die down.

               The Announcer tries to quiet them. Chants of "Hank, Hank."

               Hank, guitar case in hand, steps over to Haymes:

                                     HANK
                         Hey, Haymes, think you can beat that?

               Hank turns and walks away before Haymes can respond. "It 
               just tickled Hank pink when a 'popular' star couldn't follow 
               him on stage," Jerry Rivers remembers about the Hadacol tour. 
               "He'd get that crowd all excited, then just sit back and 
               grin."

               EXT. FRANKLIN ROAD HOUSE - NIGHT

               A sedan drops Hank off in the driveway. He waves goodbye and 
               walks toward the front door with his guitar case. He wears a 
               long white western trench coat with black piping.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HANK'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Hank, a grin spread from ear-to-ear, whirls his two-year-old 
               son in his arms. Miss Raglin watches on disapprovingly. Audrey 
               has dyed her hair platinum blond.

                                     AUDREY
                         Maybe you ought to let him get back 
                         to sleep.

               Hank looks at Bocephus -- he is already sleeping.

                                     HANK
                         Awh, I want my son to know his old 
                         man. I'm gonna buy him a baseball 
                         bat and mitt.

                                     AUDREY
                         He's only two.

                                     MISS RAGLIN
                         I think he's already asleep.

               Hank gives Bocephus to Miss Raglin and she carries him toward 
               the bedroom.

               Hank plops on the sofa and stretches out. He removes his hat 
               and tie and throws them on a nearby chair. His hairline 
               continues to recede.

                                     HANK
                         Had a big week, hey baby?

                                     AUDREY
                         Not 'specially.

                                     HANK
                         Been doin' some travelin'?

               Audrey tries to appear innocent -- although she isn't even 
               sure of what Hank is going to accuse her of.

                                     HANK
                         Couldn't get you on the phone Tuesday 
                         or Wednesday.

                                     AUDREY
                         I was just out. I tried to get you 
                         at the Hotel Fredrick in New Iberia 
                         but you were never in.

                                     HANK
                         I just took a look at the car, Audie. 
                         You put three hundred and fifty miles 
                         on the speedometer. Where'd you go?

                                     AUDREY
                         I went nowhere, Hank. Don't talk to 
                         me that way.

                                     HANK
                         Where you gonna go fifty miles a 
                         day?

                                     AUDREY
                         It's ten miles just downtown.

                                     HANK
                         I wouldn't try that righteous stuff 
                         on Old Hank. Ev'rybody in Nashville 
                         knows about you but me.

                                     AUDREY
                         Shut your filthy mind.

               Hank fumbles in his pocket and pulls out a handful of 
               cigarette butts. He lines them up on the coffee table.

                                     HANK
                         Lookee-here, Audrey. I found these 
                         in the ashtray. There ain't but two 
                         of 'em that's got any kind of lipstick 
                         on 'em at'all.

                                     AUDREY
                         I'm supposed to ride in the car alone 
                         all the time?
                              (calling out)
                         Lycretia, come in here. Miss Raglin, 
                         get Lycretia.

                                     HANK
                              (standing)
                         Don't you get Lycretia up. Just so 
                         you don't have to account for 
                         yourself.

                                     AUDREY
                         I won't listen to any more of this, 
                         Hank Williams.

               Lycretia, rubbing her sleepy eyes, appears at the door.

                                     HANK
                              (kind)
                         Go back to bed, Lycretia.

                                     AUDREY
                              (holds out arms)
                         Come over to Momma.

               Hank points at Audrey:

                                     HANK
                         You either put Lycretia back to bed 
                         or I'm gonna take you out in the 
                         garage.

               Audrey, angry, goes to the closet and grabs her coat.

                                     AUDREY
                         Don't bother, Hank. I'm going out.

                                     HANK
                         Go ahead and leave. Leave.
                              (as she does)
                         If you don't leave me, I'll find 
                         somebody that will!

               Audrey slams the door behind her. Miss Raglin walks in to 
               take Lucretia back to bed.

                                     MISS RAGLIN
                         Miss Audrey leave?

               Hank pulls a thick wad of dollar bills out of his pocket and 
               throws them on the kitchen table.

                                     HANK
                         Don't worry. She'll be back. She 
                         forgot to take my money.

               Hank opens the cabinet and looks around for a whiskey bottle.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CASTLE STUDIOS - DAY

               The Duckhead Overalls Show was one of WSM's Saturday Night 
               Opry "warm-up" shows. Each Saturday one of that night's Opry 
               stars would host a 5:00 - 5:15 segment, do a few songs, plug 
               Duckhead, plug the Opry and plug himself.

               Hank hunches over the mike finishing "Men With Broken Hearts," 
               one of the pathetic recitations he did under the name of 
               Luke the Drifter. When asked about the "true" Hank Williams, 
               his closest friends often refer the inquirer to the 
               recitations and hymns. "Listen to that morbid, sentimental 
               stuff," said Vic McAlpin. "That was the real Hank Williams."

                                     HANK
                              (recitation)
                         Life sometimes can be so cruel that 
                         a heart will pray for death, God, 
                         why must these living dead know pain 
                         with every breath, One careless step, 
                         a thoughtless deed, and then the 
                         misery starts, And to those who weep, 
                         death comes cheap, These men with 
                         broken hearts.

               Tears form in Hank's eyes as he finishes the song. He looks 
               out over the audience. Several women are dabbing their moist 
               eyes with handkerchiefs.

               Hank steps back as Don wrings the last tearful chord out of 
               the steel guitar:

                                     HANK
                         Take it on the turnaround, Shag.

               Helms starts "Broken Hearts" up again as Hank walks back to 
               the mike and resumes the recitation. Jerry and Hillous look 
               quizzically at Don.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MOM'S - NIGHT

               Mom's was the favorite hang-out of the Opry entertainers; it 
               had a back room where a performer could drink undisturbed, 
               and its rear door was only a five-second sprint from the 
               Ryman stage exit. In 1960, Tootsie Bess bought Mom's and 
               renamed it "Tootsie's Orchid Lounge." For many years, 
               Tootsie's was a Country and Western institution, then it 
               became a shrine, soon it will be a relic.

               Hank, Red and Don sit around a table. Red and Don are drinking 
               beers, Hank a Coca-Cola. Hank lights a cigarette as Lefty 
               Frizzell sings "Always Late" on the "coin machine."

                                     DON
                         Why'd you go through "Broken Hearts" 
                         again, Harm? We 'bout ran outta time.

                                     HANK
                         Well, damn it, Shag, did you look 
                         out at the audience? Wasn't enough 
                         cryin'. Jus' a couple ladies dabbing 
                         at their faces. That recitation got 
                         to bring out the crying.

               HUGH CHERRY, 29, a local DJ, walks past with a beer.

                                     HANK
                         Hey, Cherry, come here, boy.

               Cherry steps over.

                                     CHERRY
                         Yeah, Mr. Williams.

                                     HANK
                         Cherry, I hear you got a kid born 
                         whut's got a hair lip, a cleft mouth?
                              (gestures)

                                     CHERRY
                         Yeah.

                                     HANK
                         How much it cost to fix up your kid?

                                     CHERRY
                         Two-three thousand dollars.

                                     HANK
                         You got that kind of money?

                                     CHERRY
                         No.

                                     HANK
                         I'll tell you what to do. You go to 
                         a doctor and get that kid all fixed 
                         up. Don't spare no expense. And send 
                         Old Hank the bill.

               Cherry is flabbergasted. He starts to protest:

                                     HANK
                         I don't want to hear no refusin'. 
                         You jus' take care of that boy. That's 
                         all. If you don't take my money I 
                         won't talk to you again.

                                     CHERRY
                              (effusive)
                         Thank you, Hank. It's...

                                     HANK
                         And come by later backstage and see 
                         me. You know?

               Hank's demeanor indicates he wants Hugh to bring him a drink 
               backstage -- something Red Foley doesn't miss.

                                     RED FOLEY
                         That was white of you, Hank.

               Red Foley's "Peace in the Valley," then a hit, comes on the 
               jukebox. Hank listens to the opening chords:

                                     HANK
                         I sure like the way you sing that 
                         song, "Peace in the Valley." I don't 
                         think I've ever heard singing as 
                         beautiful.
                              (pause)
                         I wanna ask you a favor, Foley.

                                     RED FOLEY
                         Anything, Hank.

                                     HANK
                         You know, if a feller does some 
                         drinkin', like you and me, it don't 
                         mean he don't believe in God.

                                     RED FOLEY
                         I know that.

                                     HANK
                         Will you sing that song "Peace in 
                         the Valley" at my funeral?

               Foley just looks at Hank:

                                     RED FOLEY
                              (flabbergasted)
                         What are you talking about, Hank?

                                     HANK
                         If I go before you, I wondered if 
                         you'd sing "Peace in the Valley" at 
                         my funeral.

                                     RED FOLEY
                         Why, Hank, I'll be gone long before 
                         you. How old are you, 29?

                                     HANK
                         27. 

                                     RED FOLEY
                         I got a lot of years on you. I'll be 
                         singing for God by the time you die.

                                     HANK
                         Yeah, maybe.
                              (a beat)
                         Just the same, Foley, I'd... 'preciate 
                         it.

               Hank's mood casts a morbid glow over the table.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. RYMAN AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

               Hugh Cherry, wearing a top coat, walks over to the rear door. 
               Charlie Sanders stands guard.

                                     CHARLIE SANDERS
                         Hey, Cherry. Put up yer arms a minute.

               Cherry raises his arms as Sanders frisks him.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. RYMAN AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

               Cherry and Hank crowd into the small MEN'S ROOM. A single 
               bulb illuminates the narrow wedge-shaped closet. A long trough 
               of soldered tin serves as a urinal.

               Hank turns Cherry around, lifts up his coat and pulls a pint 
               of Jack Daniels from Hugh's waistband.

                                     HUGH CHERRY
                         Jim Denny'd kill me if he found out.

                                     HANK
                              (taking a drink)
                         Don't worry about him boy.

               LATER, Hank stands alone as Pee Wee King and his Light Crust 
               Doughboys sing "Slow Poke" on stage.

               Hank walks over to STEVE SHOALS, 40, ERNEST TUBB, 37, EDDIE 
               ARNOLD, 33, and RED FOLEY, 42. Shoals was a record executive 
               for RCA.

                                     HANK
                              (ornery)
                         Hey, Shoals.

               They all turn.

                                     STEVE SHOALS
                         Yeah, Hank.

                                     HANK
                         Hank Snow said that you wouldn't let 
                         him record my song for RCA. You said 
                         it was low class.

               Hank is het up to fight -- the last thing anybody wants.

                                     STEVE SHOALS
                              (defensive)
                         We didn't think it was right for 
                         Hank.

                                     HANK
                         Since when is a Hank Williams' song 
                         too low class for you?

                                     RED FOLEY
                         Now, Hank.

               Hank lifts his guitar over his head like a club.

                                     HANK
                         I oughta break your fuckin' head 
                         open right now, you goddamn Jew 
                         bastard.

               Red lunges over and grabs Hank's guitar. Tubb and Arnold 
               restrain him.

                                     HANK
                         Shoals, you take these boys here, 
                         Red Foley, Eddie Arnold, Ernest Tubb, 
                         you go out on the street and stack 
                         up their new records, then you stack 
                         up a stack of new Hank Williams 
                         records, and see which one people 
                         will buy first. You just see.

               Hank turns to the others for confirmation:

                                     HANK
                         Which one would they buy?

               Foley, Tubb and Arnold -- the three most prestigious names 
               in country music -- all murmur assent ("They'd buy yours, 
               Hank") and look at each other. Nobody wants to tangle with 
               Hank, although the implications of his statement are somewhat 
               staggering: it would be as if Norman Mailer, at the age of 
               27, had insisted that Hemingway, Fitzgerald and Faulkner all 
               jointly agree that he was the best American novelist.

               Shoal's eyes catch Jim Denny's as Denny walks over.

                                     JIM DENNY
                         What's the problem, Hank?

               Denny walks off with Hank, leaving Foley, Arnold, Tubb and 
               Shoals to shrug and shake their heads.

                                     HANK
                         It's nothing.

                                     JIM DENNY
                         You're drunk again, Hank.

                                     HANK
                         Yeah, but I got reason to be.

                                     JIM DENNY
                         What's that?

                                     HANK
                         She's standing right over there.

               Denny turns and sees Audrey dressed in a white, sequined 
               gown. Her hair whirls in a bouffant style above her head.

                                     JIM DENNY
                         Oh, no. Audrey ain't going on the 
                         Opry tonight. You gave me your word, 
                         Hank. You said she'd never be on the 
                         Opry again.
                              (Hank just shrugs)
                         She can be on the Duckhead Show, but 
                         not the Opry.

                                     HANK
                         Well, hoss, you gotta look at it 
                         this way. Either she goes on the 
                         Opry tonight or I can't go home.

                                     JIM DENNY
                         This is the last time.

                                     HANK
                         I swear it, Mr. Denny. As God is my 
                         witness, I swear it.

               LATER, Hank and Audrey stand next to Red Foley in front of 
               the Prince Albert backdrop.

                                     RED FOLEY
                         ...later Grant Turner will tell us a 
                         little about Hank and Audrey's Corral. 
                         You opened up a store, huh Hank?

                                     HANK
                         Yeah, see if you can sell somethin', 
                         Red.

                                     RED FOLEY
                         But right now, I want you to do that 
                         song that you got up there on the 
                         charts. It always seems like you've 
                         got one song or another up there.

                                     HANK
                         Yeah, this one's called, "Hey, Good 
                         Lookin', what you got cookin', how's 
                         about cookin' somethin' up with me."

                                     RED FOLEY
                         And you've got somebody pretty good 
                         lookin' to sing it with.

                                     HANK
                         That's right. Miss Audrey's gonna 
                         hep me out on this song. As pretty 
                         and fine a wife as any feller could 
                         want -- and got a mighty pretty voice, 
                         too. So, c'mon, hon, let's sing 'em 
                         that song.

               Hank and Audrey step over to the mike. As the Cowboys start 
               to play, Hank twists the microphone to favor his voice:

                                     HANK AND AUDREY
                         "Hey, Good Lookin', whatcha got 
                         cookin', How's about cookin' somethin' 
                         up with me."

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. FRED ROSE'S ATTIC - DAY

               Hank, pen in hand, sits at Fred's desk. Rose paces across 
               the room.

                                     HANK
                         I got to get on the road, Pappy. The 
                         Caravan's in Augusta tonight.

                                     FRED
                         First you'll write this apology to 
                         Steve Shoals. Why did you call him a 
                         "Jew bastard?"

                                     HANK
                         I'm sorry, Pappy. I was drunk.

                                     FRED
                         He ain't even Jewish.

                                     HANK
                         I didn't know.

                                     FRED
                         What's wrong with you, Hank? Can't 
                         you moderate yourself at all?

                                     HANK
                         That's my business.

                                     FRED
                         Mine, too.

                                     HANK
                         I'm gettin' better. I'm takin' these 
                         pills now.

                                     FRED
                         I was the worst drunk in the whole 
                         music business until I found Christian

                         I may be just a drunk, but you should 
                         of seen my Daddy. Now there was a 
                         drunk.

                         You've got to control yourself. You're 
                         in trouble, Hank.

                                     HANK
                         I can't help it, Pappy. It's that 
                         goddamn Audrey and Momma. They're 
                         pullin' me apart from separate sides. 
                         I can't sleep. They're at me. They 
                         both need the money. If I quit for 
                         two weeks I'd be broke.

                                     FRED
                         That's not true.

                                     HANK
                         It's like they're pulling right at 
                         my body, Pappy. I'm in pain.

                                     FRED
                         You've got to have that back 
                         operation.

                                     HANK
                         I'm in that kinda pain, too.

                                     FRED
                         I'll warn you. The Opry is very upset. 
                         Henry Stone himself called me. You're 
                         giving WSM a bad reputation.

                                     HANK
                         They're just jealous.

                                     FRED
                         Who?

                                     HANK
                         Everybody. And those business 
                         executives, they're the worst of 
                         all. You've been to New York, Pappy, 
                         you know what I'm talking about.

                                     FRED
                              (confused)
                         They treat you great in New York. 
                         You've got Mitch Miller, Columbia, 
                         MGM all pushing your songs...

                                     HANK
                         That's not what I'm talking about. 
                         You know what I mean. You go to New 
                         York and they look down on you like 
                         some hillbilly. Don't matter how 
                         many records you sell. On the Caravan, 
                         I can shut down any act: Hope, Berle, 
                         you name it. But they still look 
                         down on you.

                                     FRED
                         Who?

                                     HANK
                         Everybody.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. MONTGOMERY - DAY

               The Hadacol motorcade heads up Perry Street past the red 
               brick Municipal Auditorium.

               Hank and Lilly ride in the back of an open white convertible. 
               A poster on the side of the car reads: "Montgomery's Hank 
               Williams" and "Mrs. Williams."

               Hank, wearing his white fringe and rhinestone jacket, waves 
               to the crowd.

               W.A. Gayle, the "Mayor of Montgomery," rides in a dark Packard 
               followed by the majorettes and the marching band of Sydney 
               Lanier High School.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MUNICIPAL AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

               The orange-and-white Hadacol banner stretches across the 
               stage, flanked by the now-battered Hadacol bottle displays.

               The Hadacol Announcer stands at the mike with Hank, Lilly 
               and JAMES WORTHINGTON, an officious man in a brown double-
               breasted suit and bow tie. Lilly wears her black dress, lace 
               collar and short "bubble" hair-do.

               Hank slings his guitar to the side as Worthington reads an 
               official proclamation:

                                     WORTHINGTON
                         "...therefore I, James E. Folsom, 
                         Governor of the sovereign state of 
                         Alabama, do hereby designate Hank 
                         Williams an official Good Will 
                         Ambassador from the state of Alabama."

               The Announcer leads the applause. Hank smiles and shifts his 
               shoulders.

                                     HANK
                         Thank you very much, Mr. Worthington.

               Lillian looks at Hank adoringly. He leans over and kisses 
               her. No mother was ever closer to Heaven than Lilly Stone at 
               that moment.

                                     HADACOL ANNOUNCER
                         Say something to the folks, Hank.

                                     HANK
                         Well, hoss, hain't got too much to 
                         say. Jus' to thank the Guv'ner and 
                         the folks here in Montgom'ry.

                                     HADACOL ANNOUNCER
                         Then maybe you'll sing a song for 
                         us.
                              (many cheers)

                                     HANK
                         Be glad to, boy. I'd like to do a 
                         new song I jus' wrote, a sad little 
                         thing called, "What Can I Do, You 
                         Win Again."
                              (to band)
                         Let's hit it, boys.

               Hank chooses this moment to sing one of his most personal 
               and melancholy songs. His voice leaves no doubt that the "I" 
               of the song is none other than the Good Will Ambassador 
               himself, Hank Williams:

                                     HANK
                         "The news is out all over town, That 
                         you've been seen a-runnin' 'round, I 
                         know that I should leave, but then, 
                         I just can't go, you win again.

               This heart of mine could never see what ev'rybody knew but 
               me, Just trusting you was my great sin, What can I do, you 
               win again."

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. FRANKLIN ROAD HOUSE - DAY

               Christmas decorations and lights are strung along the bushes 
               and railings. A cardboard Santa Claus, his sack bulging with 
               gifts, has one foot already in the chimney. His faithful 
               reindeer wait on the roof.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. FRANKLIN ROAD HOUSE - DAY

               The Williams' BEDROOM is decorated in Audrey's progressively 
               tasteless style. Her white "antiqued" Louis Seize bedroom 
               set has no relation to Hank's life or tastes.

               Hank, wearing a back brace, sits up in bed reading a "Vault 
               of Horror" comic. Hank Jr., wearing a western-styled jumper, 
               plays on the floor with large blocks. A radio, a glass of 
               water, several vials of medicine (one labeled "morphine") 
               and a surgical syringe sit on the night table. Little Jimmy 
               Dickens sings "They Locked God Outside the Iron Curtain" on 
               the radio.

               Hank looks over his comic book at his son. He sets his comic 
               aside, placing it atop a dozen or so other comics -- all of 
               the grotesque E.C. horror series.

                                     HANK
                         Hey, Bocephus.

               Hank Jr. continues playing.

                                     HANK
                         Come here. Come over to Daddy, Bo.

               Hank Jr. doesn't seem to hear him. Like many men raised 
               without a parent or in poverty, Hank idolized his son. He 
               wanted Bocephus to have everything he didn't.

               Hank tries to reach over and touch his son, but is restrained 
               by his brace.

               In the LIVING ROOM, ROSE SHAPIRO shows Audrey her new diamond 
               bracelet. Rose Shapiro, a close friend of Audrey's is draped 
               with expensive jewelry. Mrs. Shapiro, of Shapiro's Jewelers, 
               encouraged and cultivated Audrey's taste for "fashion design" 
               jewelry and clothes.

               Brightly-wrapped presents have been placed around the 
               Christmas tree. A plastic guitar is placed atop the tree in 
               place of the traditional star.

               Hank calls out from the bedroom:

                                     HANK
                         Audie!

               Audrey calls to Miss Raglin.

                                     AUDREY
                         Miss Raglin, see what he wants.

               Miss Raglin walks into the BEDROOM to find Hank half-stretched 
               out on the floor.

                                     HANK
                         Help me up.

                                     MISS RAGLIN
                              (helping him up)
                         You shouldn't be trying to get out 
                         of bed yet, Mr. Williams.

                                     HANK
                         I just wanted to hold Bocephus. Bring 
                         him over.

               Miss Raglin picks Hank Jr. up and places him beside his 
               father.

                                     MISS RAGLIN
                         How you feeling?

                                     HANK
                              (playing with Bo)
                         I don't think I've ever been this 
                         happy. I'm feeling so good I haven't 
                         written a song in two weeks. Where's 
                         Audie?

                                     MISS RAGLIN
                         She's in the living room with Mrs. 
                         Shapiro. Should I get her?

                                     HANK
                         Nah. I don't like that Mrs. Shapiro. 
                         She puts the wrong ideas in Audrey's 
                         head -- and that ain't hard.
                              (gestures)
                         Open that drawer there.

               Miss Raglin turns to the dresser.

                                     MISS RAGLIN
                         Here?

                                     HANK
                         Yeah, the second drawer. I wanted to 
                         give Bo one of his toys.

                                     MISS RAGLIN
                         Before Christmas?

                                     HANK
                         I'll buy him another. I'll get him a 
                         train.

               Miss Raglin pulls out the drawer. This is clearly "Hank's 
               drawer": an unsorted collection of clothes, souvenirs, guns, 
               and money -- two or three thousand dollars in loose bills 
               are scattered among the other objects.

                                     MISS RAGLIN
                         You know that Hank Jr. isn't old 
                         enough for a train yet.

               Hank looks disappointed. "I always regret I never let him 
               buy that train," Miss Raglin said twenty-five years later. 
               "Because I knew he didn't want it for Hank Jr., he wanted it 
               for himself."

                                     HANK
                         There's a toy gun set I got in 
                         Charleston in there.

               Miss Raglin picks up a hand-tooled chrome-plated Colt .44.

                                     HANK
                         No, that's a real one.

               She finds the toy holster set. She gives it to Hank who puts 
               it on Hank Jr. A smile breaks across his face.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. JERRY RIVERS' HOUSE - NIGHT

               JUNE RIVERS, Jerry's wife, answers the phone. Open Christmas 
               presents are spread under their tree.

                              (a beat)
                         Look, I'll come over and make some 
                         soup.
                              (a beat)
                         No, no, Hank. We'll be right over.

               She hangs up and turns to Jerry.

                                     JUNE RIVERS
                         There's something wrong with Hank. 
                         Let's go over.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. FRANKLIN ROAD HOUSE - NIGHT

               Jerry and June pull into the drive. Hank, barefoot, is 
               drunkenly wandering around the front yard in his pajama 
               bottoms and back brace.

               Gifts and food have been thrown all over the yard. A large 
               Christmas ham, several pistols, and a pair of women's shoes 
               lie on the grass. Hank bends over and picks up a mink coat.

               Jerry and June rush over to him.

                                     JERRY RIVERS
                              (supporting him)
                         What's wrong, Harm?

                                     HANK
                         Just leave all this other shit. I 
                         was gonna just leave the coat, but I 
                         figur'd I paid for it, so I better 
                         get it.

                                     JERRY RIVERS
                         Where's Audrey?

                                     HANK
                         I don't know. She left. Miss Raglin's 
                         on vacation. What kind of woman would 
                         throw a mink coat out on the lawn 
                         like this?

                                     JUNE RIVERS
                         You've got to get back in bed.

               Jerry motions to June to open the front door as he helps 
               Hank back inside.

                                     JERRY RIVERS
                              (to June)
                         Make some strong coffee.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. FRANKLIN ROAD HOUSE - DAY

               Hank pulls his new baby blue Cadillac convertible in front 
               of the house. "Auld Lang Syne" plays on the car radio.

               Hank gets out stiffly and notices Audrey's yellow Cadillac 
               in the garage. He walks over and examines it.

               He straightens his Stetson and walks inside.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. FRANKLIN ROAD HOUSE - DAY

               Hank walks in and sees Audrey sitting with Rose Shapiro and 
               DORIS DAVIS. All three are overdressed for the holidays.

               Anger flashes across Hank's face.

                                     HANK
                         There you are.
                              (points to Rose)
                         And you too. Get out of my house, 
                         Rose.

                                     AUDREY
                         Shut up, Hank.

                                     HANK
                              (to Rose)
                         Jus' 'cause you screw around on your 
                         husband don't mean you can go around 
                         telling everybody else to. I don't 
                         want you in my house.

                                     AUDREY
                         Hank Williams, you bastard! Apologize.

               Hank walks into the bedroom, leaving three angry women in 
               his wake. Audrey looks at Rose Shapiro as if to say, "He 
               won't get away with this."

               A moment later, Hank walks back in with his cannon-sized 
               Colt revolver.

                                     HANK
                         Get out of my house! You bitch!

               Hank fires a shot into the ceiling. The women scream and 
               scramble for the front door.

               He fires two more shots over their heads as they leave.

                                       Summer, 1952

               EXT. MADISON HOSPITAL - DAY

               Hank walks out of the sanitarium with Don Helms and RAY PRICE, 
               25. He is wearing a single-breasted navy sport jacket and 
               grey fedora.

               Price walks alongside Hank with fawning admiration. Williams 
               first heard Price on the Big D Jamboree in Dallas, took him 
               on tour, helped him get a recording contract and a spot on 
               the Opry.

               Williams and Price get into Hank's blue Cadillac, wave goodbye 
               to Don and drive off.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. FRANKLIN ROAD HOUSE - DAY

               Price drives slowly past Hank's old house. Hank, slouching 
               in the seat, looks to see if there are any strange cars in 
               the driveway. There are.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. NATCHEZ TRACE HOUSE - DAY

               Price parks in front of the two-story red brick house Hank 
               has rented on the outskirts of Nashville.

               They get out and walk inside.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. NATCHEZ TRACE HOUSE - DAY

               Hank's house looks as if two hillbilly singers live there. 
               Clothes, guitars, guns, sheet music, awards, photos and 
               clippings are generously spread around the room. A crooked 
               painting of the Grand Tetons hangs over the sofa. Hank finally 
               has a house he can decorate any way he chooses. And he's 
               made a mess of it.

               Hank plops down and dials the phone:

                                     HANK
                              (on phone)
                         Hello, is this...?

               There's a long pause as Hank cups the receiver and looks 
               away with disgust. Audrey -- on the other end of the line -- 
               won't speak to him.

                                     HANK
                              (on phone)
                         Miss Raglin?
                              (a beat)
                         Is Momma there? Put her on.

                         Yeah, Momma. It's alright. You 
                         bringing Bo over?
                              (a beat)
                         I'll send Ray to pick you up.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. NATCHEZ TRACE HOUSE - DAY

               Hank waits as Price drives up with Lilly and Hank Jr. He 
               greets his mother with a kiss as he takes Bocephus into his 
               arms.

               They walk toward the house; Price drives off.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. NATCHEZ TRACE HOUSE - DAY

               Lilly opens a box wrapped in pink paper as Hank plays on the 
               sofa with his son.

               Lilly removes a mink fur piece. Hank watches her a moment, 
               then says drolly:

                                     HANK
                         Happy Mother's Day, Lilly.

               Lilly, in her own Marjorie Mainish way, is overcome with 
               emotion:

                                     LILLIAN
                         Oh, Hiram. This is so beautiful. Too 
                         beautiful for me.

                                     HANK
                         Trade it in. At least Audie didn't 
                         get it. She got ev'rything else. I 
                         thought if I gave her half, she'd 
                         come back.

               Lilly sits down beside Hank and Bo. The years of performing, 
               hustling and drinking have taken their toll on Hank's body. 
               Each year his eyes seem to sink further into his head. His 
               clothes hang loosely on him, his hairline has receded another 
               inch. His smile is less contagious than before; each grin 
               seems to take more effort. He's been on the road fourteen 
               years, more than half his life.

                                     LILLIAN
                         Don't let it trouble you. You're 
                         better off now, Hiram. She ain't 
                         worth it. Some women are good for 
                         their husbands, other women don't 
                         seem to care at all.

                                     HANK
                         I came by the house and she wouldn't 
                         let me see Bo.

               Lilly looks at an autographed photo of Hank and Perry Como 
               taken on the set of Como's CBS TV show.

                                     LILLIAN
                         Look on the bright side. There ain't 
                         ever been an Alabama boy did well 
                         like you.

               Lilly telling Hank to "look on the bright side" has the 
               persuasive force of Niobe advising Jeremiah to "cheer up." 
               Hank just nods.

                                     LILLIAN
                              (continuing)
                         You'll always have your Momma. They'll 
                         never take your love from me.
                              (a beat)
                         What is Perry Como really like?

               Hank's mood brightens as he massages Hank Jr.'s head.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. RYMAN AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

               Hank stands at the WSM mike wearing his white Stetson, navy 
               blue western suit with yellow arrow epaulets and red-and-
               silver hand-painted tie. He waits for this cue from the steel 
               guitar, slips a tear into his voice and finishes the final 
               chorus of his new hit, "Half as Much":

                                     HANK
                         "If you missed me half as much as I 
                         miss you, You wouldn't stay away 
                         half as much as you do, I know that 
                         I would never be this blue, If you 
                         only loved me half as much as I love 
                         you."

               Hank tips his hat, takes his guitar by the neck and ambles 
               off stage.

               As he steps BACKSTAGE, he passes Ray Price, who waits 
               nervously in the wings.

                                     HANK
                              (to Price)
                         Got 'em real prime for you, boy.

                                     RED FOLEY (O.S.)
                         I want to bring out a Texas boy that 
                         you've come to like. That young fella 
                         from Dallas, Ray Price. Come out 
                         here, boy...

               As Ray walks out, Hank spots a pretty red-headed girl sitting 
               in the pew at the rear of the stage. She gives Hank the eye. 
               He runs his eyes over her, then walks over to the radio booth 
               where Minnie Pearl is sitting.

               ON STAGE, Ray sings his first hit, "Talk to Your Heart."

               IN THE BOOTH, Hank steps over to Minnie:

                                     HANK
                         Say, Minnie, you see that gal over 
                         there?
                              (gestures)
                         Ain't she the prettiest thing? Who's 
                         she here with?

                                     MINNIE PEARL
                         I don't know, Hank.

               Hank nods and walks over to the girl, BILLIE JEAN JONES 
               ESHLIMAR, 19. Billie Jean, the daughter of a Bossier City, 
               La., policeman had quit high school the year before to marry 
               Harrison Eshlimar, a soldier. The marriage hadn't worked out 
               and she was now working as a switchboard operator in 
               Nashville. She was, by the accounts of her contemporaries, a 
               sight to behold: "so pretty you could hardly look at her." 
               Billie Jean offers a more blunt description: "I had the 
               biggest tits in Bossier City when I was 12. I was what they 
               call an early bloomer."

               Price is at the mike as Hank strolls over to Billie Jean. 
               The ON STAGE Opry atmosphere is informal: Hank talks to Billie 
               Jean in full view of the audience.

                                     HANK
                              (cock-of-the-walk)

                                     BILLIE JEAN
                         Me?

                                     HANK
                         What's your name?

                                     BILLIE JEAN
                         Billie Jean Jones.

                         You married?

                                     BILLIE JEAN
                         No, sir.

                                     HANK
                         Who you here with?

                                     BILLIE JEAN
                         Faron Young.

               Billie points to where FARON YOUNG is standing.

                                     HANK
                         You gonna marry him?

                                     BILLIE JEAN
                         No, sir.

                                     HANK
                         Well then, Old Hank jus' might marry 
                         you. You're about the purtiest thing 
                         I ever seen.

               Hank smiles and ambles across the stage. Billie Jean watches 
               with great interest.

               Hank steps over to Faron BACKSTAGE.

                                     HANK
                         You that Faron Young boy?

                                     FARON YOUNG
                              (awed)
                         Yessir, Mr. Williams.

               Faron Young, then 20, was a Shreveport native who had come 
               up from the Hayride for a guest spot on the Opry. "Hank was 
               my idol," Faron remembers, "I would have laid on the floor 
               just to have him walk over me."

                                     HANK
                              (gestures)
                         That your gal?

                                     FARON YOUNG
                         Yessir, Mr. Williams.

                                     HANK
                         Me an' Don and a big ol' gal I met 
                         from Philadelphia gonna go out after 
                         the Opry. Why don't you join us?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. NOCTURNE CLUB - NIGHT

               A blue neon cocktail glass lights up the entrance. Hank's 
               Cadillac is parked out front.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. NOCTURNE CLUB - NIGHT

               Don and HAZEL HELMS, Faron, Billie Jean, Hank and a wellbuilt 
               GIRL IN A RED DRESS sit at a table inside the night club. A 
               small combo plays pop music as couples dance.

               Faron, seeking Hank's approval, speaks impulsively. Hank 
               only listens with his ears; his eyes are all over Billie 
               Jean.

                                     FARON YOUNG
                         You wouldn't remember, but one night 
                         me and a couple of friends from high 
                         school were hanging out by the back 
                         steps of the Hayride and you came 
                         out and I yelled, "Hank, someday I'm 
                         gonna be a singer like you."

                                     HANK
                         Yeah, I think I do remember that, 
                         boy.
                              (to Billie Jean)
                         Where you from, Billie Jean? You 
                         from Shreveport, too?

               Billie gazes back into Hank's eyes with all the innocence 
               she can muster. Billie Jean says she was "just a barefoot 
               girl who didn't know didley-squat about sophistication" when 
               she met Hank. Perhaps she didn't know much about 
               sophistication, but she knew plenty about men: she was well-
               known around the Officers' Clubs in Shreveport, had sported 
               with many of the Hayride stars, and was now being kept by 
               Faron in Nashville.

               But she doesn't need any wiles to win Hank. He couldn't see 
               through her if she was a pane glass window.

                                     BILLIE JEAN
                              (nods)
                         Bossier City. Me and my Momma and 
                         Daddy used to live right down the 
                         street from you and Audrey in Bossier. 
                         We lived at 912 Modica. Of course it 
                         wasn't as high-tone as your place. 
                         It was across Rat's Alley. I used to 
                         stand at the window and watch you 
                         drive down the gravel in your long 
                         blue Packard.

               Hank is hooked.

                                     HANK
                         You lived on Modica? By damn.

                                     BILLIE JEAN
                         I used to ride to school with 
                         Lycretia. The bus'd come right down 
                         the street. She didn't know me, of 
                         course, 'cause I was older, but I 
                         knew who she was.

               Hank, already a little tipsy, stands and announces:

                                     HANK
                         Why don't y'all come over to my place. 
                         Me an' Ray Price rentin' this little 
                         place on Natchez Trace. Ray's probably 
                         out roaring with the billies. Let's 
                         go on over.

               Faron and Billie Jean can hardly believe it. They've just 
               met the crown prince of country music, and he's inviting 
               them to his home.

                                     DON HELMS
                         Me and Hazel got to get home, Harm.

                                     FARON YOUNG
                         Sounds great.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. NATCHEZ TRACE HOUSE - NIGHT

               Hank has opened a large suitcase and spread it across the 
               coffee table. Inside are rows and rows of fancy pistols.

               Billie Jean picks up a Lugar by the barrel:

                                     HANK
                         That's a German Lu-gar. Bought that 
                         in Germ'ny when we were entertainin' 
                         the troops.

               Faron pours himself another drink and hands one to Hank. 
               Hank's date looks docilely on. The only thing Helms, Young 
               and Billie Jean remember about her was that she had big 
               breasts and a red dress.

               Billie puts the Lugar back and takes out a Colt .44.

                                     BILLIE JEAN
                         Is this a .38?

                                     HANK
                         No, hon, that's a Colt .44 like in 
                         the movies. That's the kind they 
                         used to shoot the Indians with.

               Faron walks over to Hank's new 45 rpm record player.

                                     FARON YOUNG
                         Hey, you got some of these 45's.
                              (looks at records)
                         What you got? Let's put something 
                         on.

               Hank looks across the room at Faron cross-eyed:

                                     HANK
                         Hey, Young, come over here.

               Hank walks into the bedroom. Faron puts one of his own songs 
               ("I Knew You When") on the player and follows Hank.

               Faron walks into the BEDROOM to find the large barrel of a 
               Colt pistol pointed squarely in his face.

               Hank, holding the pistol with both hands, weaves from side-
               to-side.

                                     FARON
                         Hank!

                                     HANK
                         Close the door.
                              (Faron does)
                         I'm in love with that girl out there, 
                         Faron. I'm gonna marry her.

                                     FARON YOUNG
                              (scared)
                         Put the gun down, Hank.

                                     HANK
                         How hooked on her are you, son?

                                     FARON YOUNG
                         It's alright, Hank. We ain't been 
                         getting along as it is.

                                     HANK
                         Let's go down to the Midnight 
                         Jamboree. You put Billie Jean in the 
                         back seat and I'll sit with her. 
                         Then you drive.

                                     FARON YOUNG
                         Okay. Put the gun down, Hank.

                                     HANK
                         You won't hit me if I put the gun 
                         down, will you, boy?

                                     FARON YOUNG
                         No.

                                     HANK
                         Promise?

                                     FARON YOUNG
                         I promise, Hank.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. ERNEST TUBB'S RECORD SHOP - NIGHT

               Faron drives down Broadway toward the famous yellow 
               guitarshaped sign. Post-Opry crowds stand outside the 
               brightlylit store.

               INSIDE THE CAR, Hank is kissing Billie Jean as Faron parks 
               the car. Ernest Tubb's familiar bullfrog voice, live from 
               the "Midnight Jamboree," comes over the car radio.

                                     FARON YOUNG
                         This car here squeaks, Hank.

                                     HANK
                         Yeah, I bet you'd like to have one 
                         that squeaked like this.

               They get out of the car and push their way toward the store.

               From 1941 to 1976, each Saturday night when the Opry signed 
               off at midnight, the faithful would move down the block to 
               the original Ernest Tubb Record Store for another hour of 
               live radio music. The store had no stage. The staff simply 
               pushed back the record racks to make room for the performers. 
               Tubb himself was the Master Of Ceremonies when he was in 
               town. When he wasn't, another Opry regular could be relied 
               on to take the stage. Like the Opry, the "Midnight Jamboree" 
               survives in a sanitized version at the new Ernest Tubb Record 
               Store #2 off Music Row.

               Faron spots Hank turning slowly in circles and pulls Hank's 
               arm over his shoulder to support him.

               Several people recognize Hank as they squeeze their way 
               inside.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ERNEST TUBB RECORD STORE - NIGHT

               Ernest Tubb wraps up a song and drawls into the WSM mike:

                                     TUBB
                         Mighty glad to do that for you. That's 
                         "Missing In Action" available here 
                         at the Ernest Tubb Record Shop, 417 
                         Broadway, Nashville, Tennessee on 
                         Decca 78 number 46389 and 45 rpm 
                         number 46389.

               A rumble of excitement goes through the elbow-to-elbow crowd.

                                     TUBB
                         Looks like we got an old friend comin' 
                         up to see us. It's Hank Williams and 
                         that young feller from Shreveport... 
                         ah... Far-on Young.

               Hank takes Faron's arm from around his shoulders:

                                     HANK
                              (to Faron)
                         Take your arm off me, boy. These 
                         folks'll thing Old Hank's drunk.

               Hank and Faron walk over to Tubb. Hank steps directly to the 
               mike:

                                     HANK
                         Howdy, friends, this is Old Hank 
                         comin' out of your radio. I got my 
                         old friend Faron Young with me and 
                         we're gonna do that number you've 
                         all been requestin'. Boys, git me 
                         started.

               There's an awkward pause. Tubb leans over:

                                     TUBB
                         What song is it, Hank?

                                     HANK
                              (confused)

               EXT. TENNESSEE COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

               Hank and Billie Jean ride through the green hills of middle 
               Tennessee. The top of Hank's baby blue Cadillac is down and 
               Billie's long, dark red hair flies in the breeze.

               Hank wears a white shirt and baseball cap. Billie, bare-
               footed, wears "shorts a size too small and a shirt a size 
               too small tied up in the middle."

               Billie slurps at a vanilla ice cream cone as the ice cream 
               blows on her face, in her hair and over her clothes.

               Billie puts her feet on the dash and wiggles her toes in the 
               wind. Hank keeps turning his head to look at her. He's as 
               happy as a kid in a candy store.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SMALL TOWN 5 & 10 - DAY

               Hank waits by the car outside a Five-and-Ten.

               Billie Jean walks out wearing new shorts and tying the tails 
               of her new size-too-small shirt across her smooth, brown 
               stomach.

               They get into the car and drive down the main street.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. TENNESSEE COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

               Hank's tapping the dash with his right hand as he looks over 
               to watch Billie Jean licking on a chocolate cone. The ice 
               cream spatters on her new shirt. Hank looks over, beaming.

                                     HANK
                         Tell you one thing, babe, Old Hank 
                         could never be ashamed of you.

               He gets an idea:

                                     HANK
                         You know what I'm gonna do? Old Hank's 
                         gonna write you a song. Get a piece 
                         o' paper an' pencil outa the glove 
                         compartment there and take this down 
                         for me. Ain't got time to do it 
                         myself.

               Hank starts beating out the tune of "Your Cheating Heart" on 
               the dash. Hank pretends to improvise the song as he goes. He 
               isn't much of an actor. Fortunately for him, Billie Jean is 
               easily and willingly fooled.

                                     HANK
                         You know I wuz telling you about 
                         that Audrey -- about her cheatin' 
                         heart. Well, that's what I'm gonna 
                         write about. You take this down for 
                         Old Hank. "Your cheatin' heart will 
                         make you pay" -- no, "weep, will 
                         make you weep. You'll cry and cry 
                         and try to sleep." You like that, 
                         hon?

               Billie Jean, very much impressed, writes as fast as she can. 
               Hank is quite impressed with himself.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. NATCHEZ TRACE HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

               Hank and Billie Jean get out of the Cadillac and walk toward 
               the house.

               The storm door is broken and ajar. Broken glass lies on the 
               steps.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. NATCHEZ TRACE HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

               A pair of high heels sit on the living room chair.

                                     HANK
                              (looking around)
                         That damn Reba's moved herself in. 
                         I'll git her out.

               Billie, confused, watches as Hank storms upstairs. A moment 
               later there are the sounds of fighting and screaming.

               Hank, his spindly arms and legs flying every which way, comes 
               tumbling down the steps. He pulls himself up and charges 
               back.

               Another moment later, REBA STEWART, wife of country singer 
               Red Stewart, comes crashing down the steps followed by Hank.

                                     HANK
                         Get your country ass outa here.

                                     REBA STEWART
                         I ain't leavin', you bastard! You 
                         promised.

               Hank takes a swing at her as she kicks him. Billie yells:

                                     BILLIE JEAN
                         Who is this, Hank? There ain't gonna 
                         be no fish fry tonight. I'm going 
                         home!

               Hank turns to Billie Jean and says angrily:

                                     HANK
                         I ain't done nuthin'.

                                     BILLIE JEAN
                         Don't lie to me, Hank. I can see.

                                     HANK
                         Oh, yeah? Who you gonna believe? You 
                         gonna believe Old Hank or are you 
                         gonna believe your own goddamn lying 
                         eyes?

               Reba takes another swing at Hank and he hauls her kicking 
               and screaming out the front door.

                                     BILLIE JEAN
                              (following them)
                         I ain't ever gonna be second! You 
                         get rid of her, Hank. I ain't comin' 
                         back 'til you get rid of her!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. NATCHEZ TRACE HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

               Hank turns to grab Billie as she walks away. As he does, 
               Reba makes a dash back inside. He grabs her by the arm and 
               throws her off the stoop.

               Reba gets up and yanks Hank off the stoop. Falling to the 
               ground, he takes a wild swing at her.

               Billie Jean disappears around the corner and keeps going.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SAN DIEGO AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

               Assorted cars, vintage 1952, park along a row of palm trees. 
               The San Diego Auditorium announces the "Grand Old Opry Show: 
               Minnie Pearl, Ernest Tubb, Hank Williams"

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SAN DIEGO AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

               Minnie Pearl says "Thank-ee kindly" and scoots off stage 
               holding her straw hat and pouch bag.

               BACKSTAGE, Minnie passes the Drifting Cowboys as they carry 
               their instruments on stage. Don Helms looks worried:

                                     DON HELMS
                         Minnie, you'd better go see Harm.

                                     MINNIE PEARL
                         What's wrong?

                                     DON HELMS
                              (futile gesture)
                         You know.

               Minnie heads toward the dressing rooms.

               Inside Hank's DRESSING ROOM, she finds this chilling sight: 
               Hank, curled in a fetal position, hides under a small lamp 
               table. The STAGE MANAGER and his ASSISTANT pull at his spindly 
               legs and arms.

               Yellow vomit has dried on the front of his white suit. His 
               whole body shakes. He looks at Minnie and cries:

                                     HANK
                              (pleading)
                         Tell them, Minnie. I'm sick. I can't 
                         work. Tell them I can't go out, 
                         Minnie. Please.

               Minnie screams and pounds her fists against the Assistant's 
               back.

                                     MINNIE PEARL
                         You can't make him go out like that! 
                         Leave him alone!

               The Stage Manager and Assistant pull Hank from under the 
               table and set him upright.

                                     MINNIE PEARL
                         He can't play!

               The Stage Manager puts Hank's hat on his head and straightens 
               his tie as they lead him out of the room toward the stage.

               A.V. BAMFORD, the tour promoter, walks in as they leave.

                                     MINNIE PEARL
                         Don't let them take Hank out there 
                         like that, A.V. Don't.

               Bamford tries to console her. Applause echoes through the 
               room as the announcer intros Hank.

                                     A.V. BAMFORD
                         What can they do? They got five 
                         thousand people out there who have 
                         paid three dollars each to see Hank 
                         Williams.

                                     MINNIE PEARL
                         I know, but...

                                     A.V. BAMFORD
                         Hank brings this on himself. He didn't 
                         play at all in Bakersfield. If he 
                         misses any more dates, I won't be 
                         able to book him at all.

               Minnie and Bamford walk BACKSTAGE. They watch Hank from the 
               wings.

               Hank hunches in front of the mike in a parody of his former 
               style. His is not simulated suffering, this is real. "During 
               the last six months," says Minnie, "he became a different 
               person. He was no longer the Hank Williams I once knew."

               A huge cheer goes up from the crowd as the Cowboys lead off 
               with the familiar chords of "Lovesick Blues." Hank instead 
               sings "Crazy Heart." The band quickly adapts.

                                     HANK
                         "You thought she cared for you so 
                         you acted smart, Go on and break you 
                         crazy heart."

               But after a line, Hank, confused, slips in "Lost Highway." 
               Don shakes his head as he again changes chords:

                                     HANK
                         "I was just a lad, nearly twenty-
                         two, Neither good or bad, just a kid 
                         like you, And now I'm lost too late 
                         to pray, I've paid the cost on the 
                         lost highway."

               Hank's come a long way from the Slocomb Schoolhouse. Bamford 
               turns to Minnie as Hank sings:

                                     A.V. BAMFORD
                         Minnie, why don't you stay with him 
                         between shows? Maybe you can sober 
                         him up -- at least keep him from 
                         getting any worse. He'll go with 
                         you. You and Maxine drive him around.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SAN DIEGO - NIGHT

               A CHAUFFEUR and MAXINE BAMFORD sit in the front of Hank's 
               dark green Cadillac limo. Hank and Minnie are in back.

               Hank scrunches into the corner of the seat, his legs folded 
               at eye level. Maxine and Pearl lead Hank in singing:

                                     MAXINE BAMFORD AND MINNIE PEARL
                         "I saw the light, I saw the light," 
                         c'mon, Hank.

               Hank joins in for a couple lines, his cheek pressed to the 
               window pane, "and then," says Minnie, "he turned around and 
               his face just broke up. His voice was like the cry of a child 
               or a wounded animal:

                                     HANK
                         That's the problem, Minnie. I don't 
                         see no light.
                              (looks out window)
                         There just ain't no light. There 
                         ain't no light.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. MADISON HOSPITAL - DAY

               Helms walks out of the sanitarium with Williams. Hank's drying-
               out sessions always gave him a false appearance of health. 
               He wears a black single-breasted sport coat and striped tie.

               They get into Hank's blue Cadillac and drive off.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               FRANKLIN ROAD HOUSE - DAY

               Don pulls into the drive and waits as Hank goes to the door.

               Hank rings the bell. A moment later, Miss Raglin comes to 
               the door.

               Hank speaks with her a moment, then turns and walks back to 
               the car. He punches his fist against his thigh as he steps 
               over to Don's window:

                                     HANK
                              (repressed anger)
                         Damn her. Take me home, Shag.

               Ray Price loads a cardboard box of his personal things into 
               his car and walks back inside.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Price picks up another box as Hank walks into the LIVING 
               ROOM. Hank, wearing a torn shirt and baseball cap, looks 
               tired.

                                     HANK
                         You don't have to go, boy.

                         I called Jimmy from your Western 
                         store. He came over and checked out 
                         all your outfits and boots -- to 
                         make sure I didn't take anything.

                                     HANK
                         Since when do I care about that crap? 
                         Take it all if you want it.

                         You don't know how you get when you're 
                         drunk.

                                     HANK
                         It ain't that bad.

                                     RAY PRICE
                         I can't take it anymore.

                                     HANK
                         Don't leave me. I'm gonna be alright.

                                     RAY PRICE
                         I got to.

               Ray turns and carries the box outside.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A number of cars are parked along the road. Party noises 
               come from inside.

               Jim Denny gets out of his car and walks in.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A motley assortment of hillbilly hangers-on party in the 
               dimly-lit living room. Margaret Whiting's cover of "I Can't 
               Help It" plays on the record player.

               Denny walks past the partiers looking for Hank.

               He finds him in the KITCHEN, drunk, hanging over the table. 
               His grey Stetson is crooked.

                                     JIM DENNY
                         Hank, they told me you were putting 
                         on a bender.

               Hank is barely coherent. He holds his stomach as if sick.

                                     HANK
                         Them bones done riz again, Mr. Denny. 
                         I got this back problem.

                         The Opry won't put up with you 
                         anymore, Hank. The Opry audience are 
                         like guests in the singer's home.

               Hank doesn't answer.

                         Do whatever you want to yourself 
                         this week, but I expect to see you 
                         sober for the Friday Night Opry. If 
                         you ain't there, you're fired from 
                         the Opry.

                         Don't worry. I'm jus' feelin' a little 
                         sick jus' now. I'll be there.

               Hank dials the phone. The LIVING ROOM is a mess. Hank, 
               brutally hung-over, runs his hand through his thinning hair.

                                     HANK
                         Hello, Mr. Denny. This is Hank.
                              (a beat)
                         I'm alright. I wanted to...

                         I know I didn't make it last night.

                              (a beat; apologetic)
                         I was sick and I wanted to come, but 
                         I looked at my watch and it was too 
                         late.
                              (a beat; contrite)
                         I woulda called, honest. I got 
                         confused, you know, Mr. Denny. I'll 
                         be there tonight.
                              (a beat: unbelieving, 
                              sad)
                         You can't do that to Old Hank. He's 
                         the star of the Opry. He don't need 
                         the Opry, the Opry needs him.

                         I'm sorry.

               Denny says something and Hank starts to cry. Large tears run 
               down his cheeks.

                                     HANK
                              (on phone)
                         I promise, Mr. Denny. I'll do 
                         anything. I'm getting better. I swear 
                         to God. Just my word between you, me 
                         and God. I swear on my own soul in 
                         Hell that I'll never miss another 
                         show.

                         Please, please, don't do this to me. 
                         This'll kill Old Hank. I'll never be 
                         late again.

                         I'm sorry, Hank. There's nothing I 
                         can do about it. Come down to the 
                         station and talk to Mr. Stapp.

                         I'm sorry.

               Denny hangs up and slowly wipes the tears from his face.

               over. Hank looks up. He is emotionally rung dry. No longer 
               crying, he's cold, almost distant from his own life.

                                     HANK
                         Well, Pappy, they fired Old Hank.

                         I know. I met with Denny and Stapp 
                         this morning. I couldn't do anything.

                                     HANK
                         I don't blame you. It's my own fault. 
                         My own goddam drinking. I gotta

                         What are you gonna do now?

                         I'm going back to Shreveport. The 
                         Hayride will take me back. I'm

                         they can get good money, to work for 
                         somebody else.

                         Are you sure you should stay on the 
                         road? Maybe you should stop working 
                         for a while.

                         Don't worry, Pappy, don't worry about 
                         anything -- nothin's gonna be alright 
                         anyhow.

               They just stare a moment at each other.

               Lum York, three years older, turns the corner at the Jefferson 
               Davis Hotel and walks up the street.

               He stops at the barber shop window, looks inside and opens 
               the door.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Hank, having his hair trimmed, looks up as Lum enters. 
               Wildroot and Prince Albert signs hang on the white plank-

                         Hey, boy, what you got to say for 
                         yourself?

                         town.

               Lum takes a seat in the chair next to Hank. The colored 
               shoeshine boy walks over, but Lum waves him off.

                                     HANK
                         I'm goin' back to the Hayride. Who 
                         needs the Opry? I'm gettin' a new 
                         bunch of boys together. You can start 
                         this week.

                         always have a job with Old Hank?

               Lum thinks, but doesn't remember Hank's offer. On the 
               barbershop radio, a local news commentator lauds the "great 
               work" being done by Senator McCarthy and his Committee on 
               UnAmerican Activities.

                         myself straight. I've got a doctor 
                         takin' care of me now. He jus' works 
                         with alcoholics. I'm alcoholic, which 
                         means my blood needs to maintain a 
                         certain level of alcoholic fluid. 
                         When the alcohol dries out, you start 
                         to cravin' it. That's why I take

                         in Oklahoma. They maintain the 
                         alcoholic fluid. If you drink any 
                         more, you jus' puke it up.

               Lum listens to this baloney, then nods.

                         I'm glad to hear you're finally 
                         gettin' some good treatment, Harm.

               Hank, alone in his blue convertible, drives down a Texas 
               street and parks in front of the Commercial Bank Building. 
               It was just four years earlier that he had arrived here with 
               Audrey, Lycrecia, Lum and a mattress tied atop his old 
               Chrysler.

               The billboards for Truman and Dewey have been replaced by

               EXT. MUNICIPAL AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

               Crowds line up outside the Auditorium for the Saturday night 
               Hayride.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LOUISIANA HAYRIDE NIGHT

               A tremendous ovation goes up as Horace Logan introduces "Hank 
               Williams and the Drifting Cowboys." Hank crosses in front of 
               the familiar Hayride barnyard backdrop, barely looking at 
               the audience.

               The "Drifting Cowboys" -- an assortment of unemployed 
               musicians from the Shreveport area -- take the stage. Billie 
               Jean's brother, SONNY, 21, plays guitar. Gone are the matching 
               uniforms and the camaraderie. Their ages vary greatly. The 
               new Drifting Cowboys are more like the day-to-day bands Hank 
               assembled when he played the schoolhouses and honky-tonks.

               Hank steps up to the KWKH microphone. Gone also is the 
               Montgomery fireball who tore down the Hayride roof four years 
               before. He moves and stands like an old man. His face is 
               drawn and without expression. His eys are empty black holes.

               He marshalls his strength and smiles. He looks backstage:

                                     HANK
                         C'mon out here, honey. C'mon, and 
                         let the folks have a look at you.

               He waves at Billie Jean, who bashfully clings to the curtain 
               backstage.

                                     HANK
                         C'mon, baby.

               Billie Jean, wearing a day dress and white shoes, walks on 
               stage. Hank puts his arm around her.

                                     HANK
                              (to crowd)
                         Ain't she something'? You know I've 
                         been singing about that "Yvonne" 
                         what lives on the bayous? Well this 
                         here is my Yvonne. Old Hank's been 
                         robbin' the cradle.
                              (applause)
                         Me an' Billie Jean's gonna get married 
                         in New Or'lons and y'all are invited 
                         to come.

               There's more cheering. Billie Jean smiles "thank you" and 
               hurries off stage. The steel player intros "I Can't Help 
               It."

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. MODICA STREET - DAY

               The steel guitar version of "I Can't Help It" continues as 
               Hank and Billie Jean play catch on the dirt road outside her 
               mother's house.

               Hank is wearing dirty western pants, cowboy boots, an old 
               white shirt and a baseball cap. Billie Jean is barefoot in 
               shorts and a size-small man's shirt.

               An old stand-up Zenith radio has been pulled on the porch at 
               912 Modica. The N. Y. Giants and Brooklyn Dodgers are playing 
               the World Series. DiMaggio is at bat.

               Hank uses an old mitt while Billie catches barehanded. All 
               things considered, their skills are about equal.

               Billie Jean tosses the ball awkwardly. It bounces off Hank's 
               mitt, hits his head and knocks off his cap.

                                     HANK
                              (childish)
                         You're trying to hit Old Hank.

               Hank steps over with an impish smile, then playfully throws 
               the ball at her. Billie Jean laughs and ducks.

               Billie, barefooted, could easily outrun Hank if she wanted 
               to -- but she doesn't want to. Instead, she pretends to run 
               and trips Hank as he passes. Laughing, Hank grabs her foot.

               They fall onto the grass together, wrestling like a couple 
               of grade school kids. Hank is all bones; Billie provides the 
               padding. They roll over and over.

               A couple of neighbor kids watch from across the street.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. OKLAHOMA CITY AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

               The sign advertises Hank Williams and the "stars of the 
               Louisiana Hayride."

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. OKLAHOMA CITY AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

               Hank, on stage, wears his Nudie-tailored suit with quarter 
               notes running down the sides.

                                     HANK
                              (to audience)
                         Now I've got a little surprise for 
                         you folks. Miss Audrey flew all the 
                         way here from Nashville so I could 
                         see my son, Bocephus.
                              (beaming)
                         Boys, bring little Bocephus out here.

               A couple members of the band head Hank Jr., wearing a suit, 
               on stage.

                                     HANK
                         I started calling him Bocephus right 
                         after he was born and it got to be 
                         so he won't answer to anything else.

               Hank lifts his son up and shows him off. Bo, frightened by 
               the noise and lights, starts crying. Hank unsuccessfully 
               tries to soothe him.

               Hank, surprised, turns to see Audrey coming on stage.

                                     HANK
                              (recovering)
                         Here's Miss Audrey now.

               Audrey waves hello to the crowd and takes Bo from Hank. 
               Although Audrey (never a good actress) tries to appear 
               friendly and casual -- "show business" -- her ill-temper 
               seethes just below the surface.

               She walks off with Hank Jr. without speaking directly to 
               Hank. He watches her a second, then motions to the band to 
               continue.

                                     HANK
                         Alright, boys, let's set those woods 
                         on fire:
                              (sings)
                         "Comb your hair and paint and powder, 
                         You act proud and I'll act prouder, 
                         You sing loud and I'll sing louder, 
                         Tonight we're settin' the woods on 
                         fire."

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. OKLAHOMA AUDITORIUM BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

               Hank plays with Bo between shows. Audrey, sullen, just watches 
               them.

               Audrey has flown to Oklahoma City for a purpose -- and it 
               wasn't to make Hank happy.

                                     AUDREY
                              (after a moment)
                         I've got to fly back to Nashville in 
                         a couple hours.

                                     HANK
                              (surprised)
                         Why?

                                     AUDREY
                         Got to work on my singing.

                                     HANK
                         You ain't got no singing. I ain't 
                         seen Bo in three months. Why'd you 
                         come here if you were jus' gonna 
                         rush him away? I gotta go back on 
                         stage in a hour.

                                     AUDREY
                         Maybe if you were more of a father, 
                         you'd see your son more.

                                     HANK
                         What's that supposed to mean?

                                     AUDREY
                         You know what I mean.

                                     HANK
                         See that feller with the black bag 
                         backstage? That's Dr. Marshall. He's 
                         got my drinkin' under control.

                                     AUDREY
                         If you came to Nashville more often, 
                         a son might even know he had a father.
                              (a beat)
                         Instead of blowing all your money on 
                         little whores saying you gonna marry 
                         'em.

               Hank catches on.

                                     HANK
                         You flew all the way here to keep me 
                         from marrying Billie Jean, didn't 
                         you, Audrey?

                                     AUDREY
                         I don't know what her name is.

                                     HANK
                              (angry)
                         Well, I love that little girl.

                                     AUDREY
                              (incensed)
                         That ain't love, Hank -- and it sure 
                         ain't that other thing 'cause you 
                         ain't no good at the other thing. 
                         You just want someone to treat you 
                         like a baby and let you drink.
                              (stands)
                         You marry that little bitch, Hank 
                         Williams, I'll go to New Orleans 
                         with Bocephus. See what you think of 
                         that.

               Audrey grabs Hank Jr. by the arm and storms out.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. OKLAHOMA CITY BAR - NIGHT

               Hank steps up to the bar. Sonny dutifully follows. Hank pulls 
               out a ten-dollar bill and slaps it on the counter.

               The BARTENDER brings a Jax.

                                     SONNY
                              (reaches in pocket)
                         Here. I'll pay for it.

                                     BARTENDER
                              (holds $10)
                         I'll take it out of this.

                                     SONNY
                         No.

                                     BARTENDER
                         What's this for then?

               Hank tries to get the beer into his stomach as quick as 
               possible. As soon as he does, it comes flying up again. Hank 
               pukes all over the bar. Sonny now gives the Bartender the 
               ten-dollar bill.

                                     SONNY
                         It's to clean up after him.

               TOBY MARSHALL, 43, walks into the bar. Dressed in a black 
               suit, he carries his ever-present "little black bag."

               Horace R. Marshall first became acquainted with alcoholics 
               when he was arrested for forging checks while representing 
               himself as working for Florida A.A. He bought a diploma from 
               a magazine salesman and devoted himself full-time to 
               "alcoholic therapy." His treatment included, by his own 
               admission, Dextro-amthetamine sulphate, Seconal and Chloral 
               Hydrate, a "knockout" sedative. It also included, by the 
               testimony of others, heroin. Marshall was investigated by 
               the State of Oklahoma when, shortly after Hank's death, 
               Marshall's own wife died of a mysterious overdose. At the 
               time he was treating Hank, Marshall had already served a 
               term in San Quentin for armed robbery, and was on parole 
               from the Oklahoma State Penitentiary, McAlester on a forgery 
               charge. Later in life, he went on to serve prison terms in 
               El Reno, Oklahoma, and La Tuna, Texas.

                                     SONNY
                              (to Marshall)
                         You're too late.
                              (looks at Hank)
                         We've got to be on stage in a half-
                         hour.

               Marshall sets his bag on the bar and looks into Hank's eyes.

                                     MARSHALL
                         He'll make it.

               Again Saturday night. Again the Hayride.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LOUISIANA HAYRIDE - NIGHT

               Hank exchanges a few words with Horace Logan as Logan walks 
               on stage.

                                     HORACE LOGAN
                              (at mike)
                         And here he is again, that boy you've 
                         been waitin' for, Hank Williams!

               The audience applauds, Logan throws out his arm, but Hank 
               just stands still. Logan tries again:

                                     HORACE LOGAN
                         That Grand Ole Opry Star with that 
                         big hit "Jambalaya" on the charts 
                         right now, Hank Williams!

               Still, not a move from Hank.

                                     HORACE LOGAN
                              (thinks)
                         Yes, that Montgomery boy that 
                         everybody's proud of, Hank Williams, 
                         also know to his friends as Herman 
                         P. Willis!

               Hank nods and saunters out. As he passes Logan, he says:

                                     HANK
                         At least you got it right this time.

               He steps over to the mike:

                                     HANK
                         I wanna do a little tune here I wrote 
                         t'other night, a song about a man 
                         with a woman with a "Cheatin' Heart":
                              (sings)
                         "Your cheatin' heart will make you 
                         weep, You'll cry and cry and try to 
                         sleep, But sleep won't come the whole 
                         night through, Your cheatin' heart 
                         will tell on you."

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. MILAN CAFE - NIGHT

               The Milan Cafe, across the street from the Auditorium's rear 
               exit, doubled as a hang-out for Hayride performers between 
               performances.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MILAN CAFE - NIGHT

               PAUL HOWARD, a western dance band leader, sits across a small 
               table from Hank sipping coffee. He notices something on the 
               right side of Hank's head.

                                     PAUL HOWARD
                         What's this, Hank?

                                     HANK
                              (shrugs)
                         Awh, just some scratches.

                                     PAUL HOWARD
                         How'd you get that?

                                     HANK
                         It's that goddamn Audrey. Audrey and 
                         Lilly. They were here a couple nights 
                         ago.

                                     PAUL HOWARD
                         Audrey was here with your Momma? I 
                         thought they hated each other.

                                     HANK
                         It's this marriage thing. It's brought 
                         them together.

                                     PAUL HOWARD
                         What do you mean?

                                     HANK
                         They don't want me to marry Billie 
                         Jean. Audrey clawed the Hell outta 
                         me. They'll go to any lengths to 
                         stop this thing. She's gonna be in 
                         New Orleans tomorrow. She'll stop 
                         the wedding.

                                     PAUL HOWARD
                         How can they stop a wedding?

                                     HANK
                         You don't know Aud'ry and Momma.

                                     PAUL HOWARD
                         You want to marry Billie, don't you?

                                     HANK
                              (nods)
                         I love Billie. She's the only one 
                         who showed me any consideration. 
                         She's the only one who took care of 
                         me.

                                     PAUL HOWARD
                         Then you can go off and get married 
                         right now. Just go out and get a 
                         J.P. Then if Audrey comes down to 
                         New Orleans tomorrow and tries to 
                         stop the wedding, you'll already be 
                         legally married.

                                     HANK
                         That's a good idea. You're my best 
                         man, Howard. We'll go after the 
                         Hayride.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Young boys huckster "Jambalaya Wedding" programs as the crowds 
               file into the Auditorium.

                                     YOUNG BOY
                         Get your programs while they last. 
                         Only one dollar. It's the souvenir 
                         of a lifetime. Hank Williams' wedding!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. NEW ORLEANS MUNICIPAL AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

               The dressing room is crowded with friends and hangers-on. 
               Hank and Sonny sit on a small sofa. The lamp table is littered 
               with empty champagne bottles and glasses.

               An announcer's voice echoes from the stage:

                                     DISC JOCKEY (O.S.)
                         Here's that "Wild Man from Texas," 
                         Billy Walker!

               Hank's face is strangely puffy. His cheeks seem bloated and -- 
               extraordinary for him -- his stomach is slightly potbellied. 
               Instead of giving Hank an air of health, this extra weight 
               makes him look sicker.

               All the members of the wedding party wear tuxedos except 
               Hank. He wears his black-and-green fringed western suit.

                                     SONNY
                         You'd better change into your tux, 
                         Hank.

                                     HANK
                         Nah, Herman. I don't...

                                     SONNY
                         Cut that out. Don't call me Herman. 
                         I'm Sonny. Your brother-in-law.

                                     HANK
                              (kidding)
                         I know you're Sonny. Where's Dr. 
                         Marshall?

                                     SONNY
                         He ain't here.

                                     HANK
                         I pay him $300 a week, and he ain't 
                         around when I need him. Did that 
                         Audrey come in?

                                     SONNY
                         She ain't comin'.

                                     HANK
                         Why not?

                                     SONNY
                         You said you'd kill her if she came. 
                         Besides, you're already legally 
                         married.

                                     HANK
                         You wanna hear a song? It's gonna be 
                         a hit.

               OSCAR DAVIS, a promoter, interrupts:

                                     OSCAR
                         They're getting ready for the weddin', 
                         Hank.

               Hank, buoyed, stands and smiles:

                                     HANK
                         Well, boy, let's get married.
                              (to Davis)
                         How much am I making on this weddin'?

                                     OSCAR DAVIS
                         About $13,000.

                                     HANK
                         That sounds purty good. I may just 
                         get married again next month.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. NEW ORLEANS MUNICIPAL AUDITORIUM STAGE - NIGHT

               Sonny, singer BILLY WALKER, 20, REV. SHELDON and others stand 
               around the WBOK microphone. Potted palms decorate the stage.

               The band strikes up the "Wedding March" as Billie and her 
               FATHER walk down the aisle.

               Hank sees Billie coming down the aisle and steps off the 
               stage. Her father looks worried.

               Hank steps up to them, lifts Billie's veil and kisses her. 
               The faithful ooh and awh.

               Then Hank turns, smiles and waves to the crowd.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BROWNSVILLE - DAY

               Hank's entourage pulls up in front of the main hotel in 
               Brownsville, Texas.

               Billy Walker, Sonny and several other musicians drag-ass out 
               of an Oldsmobile and trudge into the hotel.

               Toby Marshall tucks his black bag under his arm and helps 
               Hank out of the Cadillac. Hank's white suit is filthy and 
               wrinkled. Toby takes his upper arm and walks him to the hotel 
               door.

               Hank is becoming increasingly schizophrenic. Sometimes, he 
               is his old arrogant self; at other times, like now, he is 
               dependent and pre-senile. He likes Marshall to lead him from 
               place-to-place. He wants someone else to take responsibility 
               for his life: he's given up.

               "He didn't care how he lived at that point," Oscar Davis 
               told a journalist. "He couldn't cut out the drugs and booze. 
               I'd tell him, 'You ought to think of the boy,' and he'd cry 
               and ask for another drink."

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BROWNSVILLE HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

               Sonny, Walker and the others wait at the front desk to check 
               in.

               Marshall escorts Hank through the lobby and into the elevator. 
               Hank doesn't bother to look up.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BROWNSVILLE HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

               Hank, now full of pep and braggadocio, entertains a couple 
               sidemen in the corridor outside his room.

                                     HANK
                         If you boys plan to drink any beer 
                         tonight, you'd better get it in 
                         bottles. I've played this club before. 
                         I know these ol' boys. They like to 
                         fight.

               Hank gestures as he walks off.

                                     HANK
                         There was a boy name a' Arby Williams -- 
                         no kin to me -- from South Alabama 
                         who always carried a knife and loved 
                         to cut folks up...

               Toby Marshall steps into the doorway as Hank walks off. Billy 
               Walker steps over to him.

               Walker was then just a green and unknown singer (his first 
               hit, "Charlie's Shoes" came ten years later), but he was 
               smart enough to be suspicious. "I didn't know anything about 
               drugs back then, but I knew this doctor wasn't helping Hank 
               none. Looking back, I realize Hank was a junkie."

                                     BILLY WALKER
                              (tentative)
                         Dr. Marshall?

                         Yeah, Billy?

                                     BILLY WALKER
                              (curious)
                         What do you give Hank that peps him 
                         up so?

                                     TOBY MARSHALL
                         Why? You feelin' tired?

                                     BILLY WALKER
                         No. I was just curious.

                                     TOBY MARSHALL
                         I give him vitamins. Vitamins and 
                         injections.

                                     BILLY WALKER
                         What kind of injections? 'Cause they 
                         really get him goin'. I swear most 
                         nights he won't make it, then all a' 
                         sudden he'll be all afired.

                                     TOBY MARSHALL
                         I give him straight adrenaline.

                                     BILLY WALKER
                         Is that those red pills?

                                     TOBY MARSHALL
                         No, that's Chloral Hydrate. It's for 
                         alcoholism.

                                     BILLY WALKER
                         Billie's upset. She took four of 
                         them things like Hank did and puked 
                         out her guts.

                                     TOBY MARSHALL
                              (shakes his head)
                         She doesn't understand anything about 
                         medicine or alcoholics. She's just a 
                         child.
                              (tries to explain)
                         Alcoholics need special treatment. 
                         Most people won't take the time to 
                         care about an alcoholic. Most people 
                         won't put up with 'em. That's why 
                         I've devoted my life to the treatment 
                         of alcoholics. They're not like other 
                         people. They need someone to take 
                         care of them.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. MODICA STREET - DAY

               Hank and Billie have moved into 915 Modica, a small one-story 
               white house across from Billie's parents.

               The front window is open. Two large boots stick out the 
               window.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. 915 MODICA - DAY

               Hank sits in a hard-backed chair, his feet on the window-
               sill. He wears a sleeveless T-shirt, pajama bottoms and his 
               embroidered eagle boots.

               Hank's atypical puffiness has vanished. In fact, he's 
               dramatically lost weight. He's wasting away.

               But, for the moment, Hank feels no pain. He sits in a stupor, 
               an idiot's grin spread from ear-to-ear.

               In the background, a radio plays Hank's current hit, "I'll 
               Never Get Out of This World Alive."

               A car pulls in front of the house and Sonny and his brother 
               AL get out. Hank checks the pistol in his waistband as he 
               watches them walk toward the house.

                                     HANK
                              (calling)
                         Billie Jean.

               Billie Jean walks into the room as Sonny and Al near the 
               door. Hank looks over and smiles:

                                     HANK
                         Billie, would you get Old Hank his 
                         hat? It looks like he's a-goin' to 
                         the horse-pital again.

               Hank looks with resignation out the window.

               Sonny and Al walk in as Billie places Hank's hat on his head. 
               Sonny reaches over, removes Hank's gun and gives it to Al 
               who sets it aside.

               Sonny, bending over to pick up Hank, feels something unusual. 
               He walks toward the bathroom.

                                     SONNY
                         Billie, you got some towels?

                                     BILLIE JEAN
                              (following him)
                         Why?

                                     SONNY
                         He's pissed on hisself again.

                                     BILLIE JEAN
                         He ain't crapped, has he?

                                     SONNY
                         No.

               Billie hands Sonny a stack of towels.

                                     BILLIE JEAN
                         Sonny, you got some money?

                                     SONNY
                         A little.

                                     BILLIE JEAN
                         For the hospital.

                                     SONNY
                         Don't you have any?

                                     BILLIE JEAN
                         Not a cent. Hank's broke. They don't 
                         give him any money.

                                     SONNY
                         Not even the wedding money?

                                     BILLIE JEAN
                         He ain't seen any of it yet. They 
                         jus' give him enough to keep him in 
                         booze.

                                     SONNY
                              (walking back)
                         Jesus.

               Sonny dries Hank. He and Al bend down and pick Hank up in 
               their arms.

               They carry him out the front door. Gone also is the Hank 
               Williams who had to be dragged kicking and screaming into 
               Madison Hospital. He now goes to Hyland Hospital as 
               compliantly as any lobotomized out-patient.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. 915 MODICA - DAY

               Sonny and Al carry Hank to the car as Billie watches from 
               the door. Hank sings as he goes:

                                     HANK
                         "Goodbye Joe, me gotta go, me oh my 
                         oh, Me gotta go pole the piroque 
                         down the bayou..."

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. MUNICIPAL AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

               Hayride night.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LOUISIANA HAYRIDE - NIGHT

               Hank, seriously drunk, stumbles around the stage. His white 
               hat falls off his head. Stooping down to pick it up, he almost 
               trips.

               The band just plays segue riffs, waiting for Hank to start a 
               song -- any song.

               The audience snickers and laughs. There are several hoots 
               from the rear -- then a few boos.

               Hank doesn't realize that they are not laughing with him, 
               but at him:

                                     HANK
                         You like that, huh? Pretty good, 
                         huh? Well, Old Hank's gonna sing you 
                         another one jus' like it.

               The crowd breaks up in derision and ridicule. Horace Logan 
               standing at the side of the stage, has had about as much of 
               this as he can take.

               Horace rushes on stage and puts his arm around Hank to support 
               him. Holding Hank in this manner, Logan says into the mike:

                                     HORACE LOGAN
                              (angry)
                         You folks been entertained by this 
                         man for hours and weeks and years. 
                         You have seen and felt this man's 
                         genius and ability. When he's 
                         straight, you all know how great he 
                         is. But when he's having problems, I 
                         will not stand for you laughing at 
                         this man.

               Horace leads Hank off stage to where Toby Marshall and Lillian 
               are waiting.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MILAN CAFE - NIGHT

               Lilly sits with Horace Logan.

                         They've taken him to dry out again. 
                         My boy's real sick.

                                     HORACE LOGAN
                         He's losing weight. For a while he 
                         seemed to be getting better.

                                     LILLIAN
                         That little whore claims she was 
                         feeding him up.

                         It was just bloat.

                                     LILLIAN
                         He don't keep food down. He needs 
                         full-time medical care. I'm a lay 
                         nurse.

                         I'm paying Dr. Marshall now. Hank 
                         can't take care of his expenses 
                         anymore.

                                     HORACE LOGAN
                         We'll put him on temporary release 
                         from the Hayride right now. As soon 
                         as he finishes the South Louisiana 
                         tour, he's got to straighten up.

                                     LILLIAN
                         I'll take care of him.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BAYOU ROAD - DAY

               Hank, Billy Walker and another musician are squeezed into 
               the back of Hank's blue Cadillac. Hank, wearing blue pants, 
               an old shirt and baseball cap, looks like a mess. "Nobody 
               took care of him at that time," Walker remembers. "His clothes 
               were always a mess and he stank."

               Hank pulls a pill bottle out of his pocket, shakes a "yellow 
               jacket" out and pops it into his mouth. Walker watches 
               disapprovingly.

                                     HANK
                         It's my chest, Herman. I can't hardly 
                         breathe. It's all squeezed.

                                     BILLY WALKER
                         You know that Doctor ain't no good 
                         for you.

                                     HANK
                              (confidential)
                         I'm goin' back on the Opry, son. I 
                         talked to Jim Denny on the phone 
                         last night. It's all a secret. It's 
                         going to be a surprise comeback. 
                         I've got to play out this tour -- to 
                         show 'em I'm in shape -- then get 
                         some rest. I'm goin' to the Bahamas. 
                         You ever been there, Herman? The sun 
                         shines there all year. You jus' lay 
                         around. When I get there, I'll be 
                         alright. I got a whole head full of 
                         songs. Gotta get 'em down. I'm gonna 
                         write one jus' for you, boy. Gonna 
                         get rid of all these squirrels hangin' 
                         around me: that quack, Billie Jean...

                                     BILLY WALKER
                         But Billie loves you, Hank.

                                     HANK
                         She's jus' like Audrey and Lilly. 
                         All they want is my money. They'll 
                         do anything to keep me working. It's 
                         like I'm some goddamn nigger slave.

                                     BILLY WALKER
                         That's great news about the Opry.

                                     HANK
                         Yeah, me an' Miss Audrey gonna get 
                         back together. I called her yesterday. 
                         I'm gonna be a father to my son again. 
                         Stop playing these honky-tonks. I 
                         hate these clubs. I'll never play 
                         them again.

                                     BILLY WALKER
                         You seen 'em all.

                                     HANK
                              (nods)
                         When I was jus' a boy, twelve years 
                         old, Momma would book me in the tonks 
                         'round Greenville so I'd send the 
                         soldier boys over to her boarding 
                         house afterwards.

               This conversation, recounted by Walker, was very unusual for 
               Hank. Not only was he open and frank, he was also critical 
               of his mother in the presence of an "outsider." Although 
               most of Hank's friends have heard about Lilly's "boarding 
               houses," Walker is the only one who heard Hank admit that 
               his mother was a lay Madam as well as a lay nurse.

                                     BILLY WALKER
                         You'll be alright.

                                     HANK
                         Yeah. I'm gonna go to them Bahamas.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LAKE CHARLES CLUB - NIGHT

               Hank, drugged and drunk, stands before the large Cajun dance 
               crowd.

                                     HANK
                         We're gonna slow it down a little 
                         bit now, hope you don't mind. Jus' 
                         get close and close your eyes. A sad 
                         little thing... I wrote, oh, some 
                         time ago called "Take These Chains 
                         From My Heart and Set Me Free."

               Hank, sinking fast, starts through a halting, pathetic 
               rendition of "Take These Chains From My Heart."

               "Take these chains from my heart and set me free, You've 
               grown cold and no longer care for me, All my faith in you is 
               gone but the heartaches linger on, Take these chains from my 
               heart and set me free."

               Once or twice, Hank sinks his head back, gets woozy and 
               struggles to stay on his feet. After the final chorus, Hank 
               turns and walks off stage.

               The band is startled. The Cajuns yell for him to come back.

               The CLUB OWNER leads Hank back by the arm. "Lovesick Blues, 
               Lovesick Blues," the cry goes up.

               The Club Owner has made a mistake. Hank is in no condition 
               to continue. He looks at the hostile crowd and says to the 
               Owner:

                                     HANK
                         Screw 'em.

               And walks off.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. LAKE CHARLES CLUB - NIGHT

               A dozen or so drunk local "coon-asses" attack Hank's blue 
               Cadillac. They rock the car, thump the hood and yell Cajun 
               curses.

               Inside, Hank cringes on the floor in the back seat. Billie 
               huddles against the seat, screaming:

                                     BILLIE JEAN
                         Get going, Sonny. These coon-asses 
                         gonna kill us!

                                     HANK
                         I ain't gonna sing "Lovesick Blues," 
                         Billie. I ain't gonna sing "Lovesick 
                         Blues."

               Sonny, behind the wheel, gets the car in gear and drives 
               away from the crowd.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. DOWNTOWN MONTGOMERY - DAY

               The Jefferson Davis Hotel looking down Katoma.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. LILLY'S MCDOUGH BOARDING HOUSE - EVENING

               Lilly now lives in the boarding house Hank bought her at 318 
               N. McDough. A Christmas wreath hangs on the door.

               Hank's blue Cadillac stands at the curb.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MCDOUGH KITCHEN - EVENING

               It's a familiar scene around the table in Lilly's kitchen: 
               some old faces, some new -- the same unpleasant ambience. 
               Mr. Stone sits Sphinx-like alongside Lilly's new boarders. 
               Billie passes a bowl of potatoes to Hank's Waterhead Cousin. 
               Lilly stands watch by the stove.

               Christmas carols play on Lilly's old radio.

               Hank, wearing his grey Stetson, pokes lethargically at a 
               tough piece of meat.

                                     LILLIAN
                         Eat up, Hiram.

               Billie spoons a dab of her mashed potatoes onto his plate.

                                     BILLIE JEAN
                         Here, Hank.

               Lilly flashes her cold eyes at Billie -- Billie flashes back.

               Hank reluctantly places a forkful of potatoes in his mouth. 
               The reaction is just as he feared: his face pales as the 
               food passes down his esophagus.

               He grabs his stomach, hurries into the water closet and closes 
               the door behind him.

               The boarders try to eat despite the sounds of retching which 
               come from the bathroom. Billie wants to run to Hank's side, 
               but is afraid to confront Lillian.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MCDOUGH HALLWAY/BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Hank, still wearing his hat, sits on the edge of the bed as 
               his mother rolls up his sleeve. She prepares a syringe, rubs 
               alcohol on Hank's emaciated arm and gives him an injection.

               Billie, standing in the corridor, watches through the ajar 
               door.

               She waits for Lilly to step outside, then closes the door 
               behind her.

               Down the hallway, behind Billie Jean, a decorated Christmas 
               tree is lit up in the living room.

                                     BILLIE JEAN
                         What are you giving him?

                                     LILLIAN
                              (hostile)
                         Large vitamin doses. They're 
                         prescribed by Dr. Marshall.

               INSIDE THE BEDROOM, Hank's face relaxes as pain-killing relief 
               fills his tortured body. He curls up on the bed, pulls his 
               hat tight over his eyes and tries to block out the 
               conversation outside the door:

                                     BILLIE JEAN (O.S.)
                         Did he promise to buy the boarding 
                         house across the street?

                                     LILLY (O.S.)
                         That's none of your business. He's 
                         my son.

                                     BILLIE JEAN (O.S.)
                         When?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. ST. JUDE'S CHURCH - DAY

               St. Jude's is a large Catholic Church on Fairview Ave.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ST. JUDE'S CHURCH - DAY

               Hank and Billie sit together in the back of the nearly empty 
               church. A parishoner kneels in front, crosses himself, and 
               walks out.

               During the last week of his life, Billie Jean says, she and 
               Hank sat in St. Jude's most everyday. Although nominally a 
               Baptist, he spent his final days in a Catholic church. Perhaps 
               it was because St. Jude's was open every day, perhaps it was 
               because they didn't make Hank take off his hat.

               In either case, it was revealed after Hank's death that he 
               had given five thousand dollars to St. Jude's the last year 
               of his life.

               Hank shakes hands with the priest as they leave.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. MCWILLIAMS, ALABAMA - DAY

               Billie watches as Hank, Christmas present in hand, knocks on 
               the door of a small backwoods house.

               After several unanswered knocks, Hank gives up.

                                     BILLIE JEAN
                         He's not home?

                                     HANK
                         He's probably on a drunk somewhere.

                                     BILLIE JEAN
                         I wanted to meet your father.

                                     HANK
                         Yeah, I shoulda known he wouldn't be 
                         home.
                              (a beat)
                         We'll leave the present at my cousin's 
                         house.

               They walk back to Hank's waiting Cadillac.

                                     HANK
                         Old Hank's goin' back to the Opry. 
                         We're gonna build a big house in 
                         Nashville -- jus' for you and me.

                                     BILLIE JEAN
                              (excited)
                         That would be wonderful.

                                     HANK
                         First I'm goin' to the Bahamas and 
                         rest up. I got some new songs.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SKIPPERS' HOME - DAY

               Hank stands by the Christmas tree in the Georgiana home of 
               Taft Skipper, his first cousin.

               Neighbors and relatives have gathered 'round to see Hank and 
               hear him sing. Hank's present for his father sits on the 
               table.

               Hank, unaccompanied and completely sober, plays an old hymn, 
               "How Can You Refuse Him Now?" His voice is straight, simple 
               and sincere -- for a moment the old energy returns.

               He is one with the words of the song. His voice aches as he 
               sings:

                                     HANK
                         "As they nailed His hands, He cried 
                         they don't understand, As the blood 
                         flowed from His side.
                         How can you refuse Him now?
                         How can you refuse Him now?
                         How can you turn away from His side?
                         With tears in His eyes on the cross 
                         there He died, How can you refuse 
                         Him now?"

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HANK'S MCDOUGH BEDROOM - NIGHT

               The words of "How Can You Refuse Him Now?" bleed into the 
               bedroom where Billie lies awake. The bedstand clock reads 
               2:00 a.m.

               Hank, wearing his pajamas, bounces on the balls of his feet, 
               shadow boxing.

                                     BILLIE JEAN
                         Come to bed, Hank. You've got to 
                         catch a plane in the morning.

                                     HANK
                         I can't sleep, Billie.

                                     BILLIE JEAN
                         Try again.

               Hank sits on the edge of the bed, starts to lie down, then 
               sits up again.

                                     HANK
                         I can't sleep, Billie. I'm afraid.

               Hank stands and paces around the small room.

                                     BILLIE JEAN
                         Afraid? Afraid of what?

                                     HANK
                         I don't want to sleep. I can't sleep, 
                         Billie.
                              (walks over to her)
                         Ev'ry time I lie down and close my 
                         eyes, I see the Lord comin' down the 
                         road. Comin' after me.

               Billie reaches out and takes his hand.

                                     BILLIE JEAN
                         You're just lonely, Hank. Take some 
                         pills. You need to sleep.

               Billie gestures to the bottle on the dresser.

                                     HANK
                              (walking over)
                         I already took a couple.

               Hank shakes four red capsules of Chloral Hydrate out of the 
               bottle and swallows them.

               He crawls in bed and lies alongside Billie Jean, nestling 
               his head in her breast like a baby.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HANK'S MCDOUGH BEDROOM - MORNING

               Hank, already dressed in his white double-breasted suit, 
               wakes Billie Jean up.

                                     HANK
                         Billie?

                                     BILLIE JEAN
                         Huh?

                                     HANK
                         The planes are fogged in. I've hired 
                         a driver. Maybe I'll be able to pick 
                         up a plane to Charleston if it clears. 
                         Toby'll meet me there.

                                     BILLIE JEAN
                              (waking up)
                         Driver?

                                     HANK
                         Momma got one for me.

               Billie Jean looks at her negligee, then sniffs. She touches 
               her negligee and sniffs her fingers. She runs her fingers 
               across her matted hair:

                                     BILLIE JEAN
                              (panic)
                         I got piss all over me! Hank, why'd 
                         you do this?

               Hank, embarrassed, cringes.

                                     BILLIE JEAN
                         You pissed all in my hair.

                                     HANK
                              (defenseless)
                         I can't help it, Billie.

               Billie Jean gets out of bed, opens the dresser drawer and 
               throws some of her clothes on the floor dramatically.

                                     BILLIE JEAN
                         Hank Williams, you have pissed on me 
                         for the last time. Go off to 
                         Charleston and Canton, but don't 
                         expect me to be waiting when you 
                         come back. I'm goin' back to my Momma 
                         and I don't know if I'm gonna come 
                         back.

                                     HANK
                         Oh, Billie, don't treat me like this.

                                     BILLIE JEAN
                         Go on. Don't miss your ride.

               Hank turns sadly and walks out the door.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. MCDOUGH BOARDING HOUSE - MORNING

               CHARLES CARR, an 18 year-old Montgomery taxi driver, stands 
               alongside Hank's blue Cadillac convertible.

               Hank kisses his mother goodbye, then, thinking, goes back 
               into the house.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HANK'S MCDOUGH BEDROOM - MORNING

               Billie Jean stands looking in the mirror, her back to Hank, 
               as he walks in.

               Hank sits on the edge of the bed and looks at her. Billie, 
               without turning around, says:

                                     BILLIE JEAN
                         What do you want, Hank?

                                     HANK
                         Old Hank jus' wanted to look at you 
                         one more time.

               Billie Jean refuses to turn around.

               After a moment, Hank gets up, steps behind her and kisses 
               her on the side of the cheek. She doesn't look at him.

               Hank turns and walks out the door.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. MCDOUGH BOARDING HOUSE - MORNING

               Hank gets in the back seat of the Cadillac as Charles Carr 
               starts the engine. Lilly kisses her son goodbye.

               The blue Cadillac drives away.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. KNOXVILLE - NIGHT

               Hank's car is parked outside the foggy Knoxville airport.

               Carr shrugs and gets back into the driver's seat.

                                     CHARLES CARR
                         We ain't gonna get a plane tonight, 
                         Mr. Williams.

               Hank jots lyrics down on a scrap of paper.

                                     HANK
                         Alright, let's drive on to Canton. 
                         We'll never make Charleston anyway.

               Carr puts the Cadillac in gear and drives off.

                                     HANK
                         There's a doctor on t'other side of 
                         Knoxville. I want you to stop there 
                         and wait. I need a shot. My back's 
                         killin' me. My bones are risin' again.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. KNOXVILLE DOCTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Hank, rubbing his hand, walks out of the doctor's office (to 
               this day, Carr claims to have forgotten the doctor's name or 
               address) and gets back into the car. His legs are wobbly.

               The Cadillac pulls away. Light snow is falling.

               Hank slumps into the back seat. He takes out his bottle of 
               Chloral Hydrate and swallows several pills.

               His hand is bandaged where he has received the injection.

               Guy Lombardo's band plays "Auld Lang Syne" on the car radio 
               as the New Year's ball falls in Times Square.

               Hank pulls his hat over his eyes and tries to sleep.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               U.S. 11 - NEW YEAR'S EVE, 1952 - NIGHT

               Light snow falls in the Smokeys as the Cadillac speeds north 
               on old U.S. 11.

               Near Rudledge, a Tennessee Highway Patrol car pulls Carr to 
               the side of the road.

               About 2:00 a.m. State Highway Patrol Cpl. SWANN KITTS gets 
               out of his flashing squad car and walks over to the Cadillac.

               He pulls out his ticket book and writes a speeding fine.

                                     CPL. SWANN KITTS
                         That'll be twenty-five dollars.

               Cpl. Kitts hands Carr the ticket and Carr gives him twenty-
               five dollars.

               Kitts, curious, looks at Hank sleeping in the back seat. 
               Hank's hat is pulled over his pale face.

                                     CPL. SWANN KITTS
                              (to Carr)
                         That guy looks dead.

                                     CHARLES CARR
                         He's just sleeping.
                              (a beat)
                         He ain't dead. He's Hank Williams.

               Cpl. Kitts, satisfied, walks away.

               Charles Carr puts the Cadillac in gear and drives into the 
               snowy night.

               The camera closes in on Hank's half-obscured face. The red 
               veins bulge from his white cheeks: he is dead.

               His frozen face does not have the distant peace of an icon. 
               Instead it is locked in grotesque passion, like the face of 
               one suspended on a gothic crucifix.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               BEGIN FINAL CREDITS

               FADE IN:

               Hank, age 26, at the height of his success, stands on the 
               Grand Ole Opry stage at the Ryman Auditorium.

               Behind him, the Drifting Cowboys -- Don, Jerry, Sammy, 
               Hillous, Bob -- lead into "I Saw the Light."

               Hank, full of energy and passion, jumps into his best-known 
               hymn:

                                     HANK
                         "I wandered so aimless, life filled 
                         with sin, I wouldn't let my dear 
                         Saviour in.
                         Then Jesus came like a stranger in 
                         the night, Praise the Lord, I saw 
                         the light."

               FINAL CREDITS - CONT.

               As Hank and the Cowboys sing, they are joined by the actors 
               who portray those who have played an important role in the 
               film: Minnie Pearl, Roy Acuff, Ernest Tubb, Faron Young, 
               Billy Walker, Ray Price, Billie Jean, Wesley Rose, Lum York, 
               Grant Turner, A.V. Bamford, Oscar Davis, Little Jimmie 
               Dickens, Hugh Cherry, Nudie, Vic McAlpin, Hank Jr., Lycrecia 
               and Miss Raglin.

               "Just like a blind man I wandered alone, Worries and fears I 
               claimed for my own, Then like the blind man that God gave 
               back his sight, Praise the Lord, I saw the light."

               Then, behind each actor, steps his or her real life 
               counterpart. Minnie Pearl steps behind the actress who 
               portrays her. Don Helms behind his actor, Acuff behind his 
               and so on. They all join in the singing.

               Before long, the wide panavision screen is filled with musical 
               legends: fifty years of country music in a single frame.

               This is how his friends chose to remember him: Hank Williams 
               dressed in white, at the peak of his powers -- the living 
               legend.

               HANK'S APOTHEOSIS:

               "I saw the light, I saw the light, No more darkness, no more 
               night, Now I'm so happy no sorrow in sight, Praise the Lord, 
               I saw the light.
