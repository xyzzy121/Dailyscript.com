                           NEAR THE MIDDLE OF THE UNITED STATES

               o.s., quiet, but swiftly louder, the humming, then hammering 
               of rails; then over this, increasing SOUND, the SOUND of a 
               hoarse, old-fashioned train whistle coming swiftly nearer: 
               two long blasts, one short, one long, which trails down and 
               out.

               Over the fading train whistle and increasing train SOUND

               FADE IN:

               TITLE

               below center:

                        TOWARDS THE END OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY

               Start the rapid SOUND of a train bell. SWOOP SOUND of bell 
               and train up suddenly two seconds before

                                                                CUTTING TO:

               CLOSE SHOT -- A TRAIN (NITE)

               Instantly bring SOUNDS of train and bell up as loud as the 
               audience can stand. A transcontinental express-train crosses 
               through r.s. to l.s. at frightening velocity. CAMERA is 
               pulling back from a close shot at medium height of the train. 
               In the train's wake, a long, luminous ruche of snow is raised, 
               filling the screen, and slowly sinking, as SOUNDS dwindle 
               o.s.

               As the last snow settles to the ground, and the SOUNDS die 
               o.s., the CAMERA ends its pull-back about 12 feet off the 
               ground in a

               LONG SHOT -- EXT. A STATION, A SMALL HOTEL, A SMALL TOWN, 
               THE PRAIRIE -- IN DARKNESS AND SILENCE

               It is not snowing and the night sky is overcast but the snow 
               on the ground gives off enough light -- using infra-red if 
               need be -- to establish the station (extreme l.s.), the hotel 
               (dead center), the edge of the town (extreme r.s.). Even in 
               darkness the hotel gives off something odd and curdled. Beyond 
               and between these buildings, as our eyes become accustomed 
               to the darkness, we see an immense perspective of snowed 
               land, and a very distant low horizon against a black sky 
               which holds two thirds of the screen.

               HOLD THIS DARKNESS perhaps eight seconds Then, within a 
               maximum thirty seconds, the darkness alters through the lights 
               of pre-dawn, dawn, etc., to the light of late morning. At 
               the proper early juncture, one or two small lights appear in 
               windows, and go out again. At the edge of the town, in the 
               earliest real daylight, a man's tiny figure comes out of a 
               door and walks out of r.s. Little flags of smoke and steam 
               sprout, compact and crisp, in the bitter air. Shading and 
               detail become increasingly clear. The station is coal-black; 
               its sign FORT ROMPER, is just readable. The town is mostly 
               low, mean, frame construction -- the drab shades of tired 
               blotting-paper. The Hotel, of a disturbing shade even in 
               darkness, gives off under the changing light an always more 
               and more sinister and unearthly fish-belly glare. Its sign, 
               PALACE HOTEL, is newish, and easy to read. It is a crummy 
               rather frail-looking wooden building of two stories, crowned 
               by florid cornice work.

               Beyond these buildings we can see perhaps forty miles. The 
               sky is dull gray; the snow is like rice; there are farms, at 
               lonely distances apart.

               When high, shadowless morning light is established, the tiny 
               silhouette of a man -- SCULLY -- walks briskly out of the 
               Hotel front door and towards the station. o.s., begin and 
               bring up SOUNDS of an overworked locomotive and a train; he 
               walks faster; bring up the SOUNDS; he trots; a somewhat 
               archaic locomotive, crusted and bearded with ice and snow, 
               slowing, drags on from l.s. a baggage car, a daycoach, the 
               first of a string of boxcars; covering SCULLY as he trots; 
               stopping. As quickly as will not be be absurd, SCULLY 
               reappears, walking towards the Hotel, followed by the COWBOY, 
               the EASTERNER, the SWEDE, in single file. At the same moment, 
               the CAMERA, which is centered on the hotel door, starts 
               towards the door at their pace, holding them within left-
               screen. We get at first only character by silhouette and 
               near-silhouette, then in more detail.

               SCULLY is in the lead, half-turning as he walks, to talk; 
               short, chunky, late middle-aged. Next, the COWBOY, size and 
               structure of John Wayne, tight city trousers, a solid block 
               of mackinaw, his best hat; he walks like a horseman and with 
               the stooping, rather diffident stride of a man of his height; 
               he carries a scarred raw-hide suitcase or a splotched Holstein-
               hide roll-grip. Next, the EASTERNER. He is small, slender, 
               bears himself well and entirely without the bumptiousness of 
               so many small men. Without at all mincing, he is more neat-
               footed along the icy boards than the others are; he carries 
               a briefcase and a middle-sized, neutral valise, possibly 
               with faded labels on it. Last, the SWEDE: He is above average 
               height but stocky enough to seem shorter than he is, and 
               disturbed and scared enough, as a rule, to sag an inch or 
               two more. A shiny black leather coat to the middle of the 
               thighs, trousers which look as if he had on two suits of 
               long underwear beneath them, a cap of coarse hairy wool, two 
               sizes too small, high on his head, with earflaps which at 
               best cannot thoroughly cover his ears. There is something 
               shaky, equivocal and arythmic about his walking. An outsize 
               new suitcase which looks to be covered by black oilcloth 
               increases his clumsiness at the knees.

               As these men grow out of silhouette into detail and size, 
               and we begin to hear their SOUNDS, the CHOWF-CHOWFINGS of 
               the locomotive, o.s., drown out these SOUNDS and the 
               locomotive and the train, gathering speed, cut off the men 
               from view and then fill most of the screen, the Hotel still 
               jutting above. As locomotive makes r.s., the CAMERA is quite 
               close to train and place-names, emblems and names of lines, 
               swinging by, suggest the whole nation and continent in 
               geography and history.

               CUT OR LAP:

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               MEDIUM TWO SHOT -- FACADE OF HOTEL -- DOOR AT CENTER

               The CAMERA is still creeping, lowering quietly to eye height. 
               o.s. SOUNDS of walking on icy boards. The four men enter, 
               in single file and in the same order, at l.s. SCULLY steps a 
               pace past his door and wheels and stops abruptly, bowing 
               slightly and flinging out one hand in a slightly uneasy parody 
               of Mine Host and causing the others to stop or tread water 
               in uneasy courtesy, indulging his spiel. The CAMERA stops 
               creeping at the same moment; they are medium close. The 
               EASTERNER looks quietly and curiously at the strange color.

                                     EASTERNER
                              (politely concealing 
                              his faint nausea)
                         I've never seen the shade before, 
                         but once.

                                     SCULLY
                              (a little jealous, 
                              but very polite)
                         And where might that be, may I ask?

                                     EASTERNER
                         On the legs of a kind of heron; one 
                         of the wading birds. It's a very 
                         strange color; there's nothing else 
                         quite like it in Nature. It declares 
                         the bird's position against any 
                         background.

                                     SCULLY
                         Declares his -- does it now! Well 
                         now, surely that's a mischievous hue 
                         for the Almighty to paint a poor 
                         craytcher in this murderin' world. 
                         Declare me position indeed. Aginst 
                         inny background. That's nicely put. 
                         That's it in a nutshell. You kin see 
                         the Palace Hotel for miles up the 
                         line, all weathers, and she's starin' 
                         like the morning star. Now didn't 
                         ye? And do ye truly admire it?

                                     EASTERNER
                         It's a very remarkable shade.

                                     SCULLY
                         Ahh, count on a traveled man for 
                         connisewership! But gintlemen, may 
                         heaven forgive me an' me guests 
                         rattlin' their teeth on me own 
                         doorstep.
                              (he hurries to open 
                              the door and wave 
                              them past him)
                         Come in! Come in!
                              (to Johnnie)

                         'em up along the south corridor and 
                         don't let the grass grow under yer 
                         feet. Hang yer coats in here, 
                         gintlemen, unless ye prefer to go

                         No. -- No, thanks.

                                     SCULLY
                              (continuing)
                         Let's thaw ourselves out a bit; ye 
                         can sign up at yer layzhure. Not 
                         that ev'ry room in me establishment 
                         ain't as warm as toast, gintlemen, 
                         but in weather the likes o' this, ye 
                         should have the binifit o' the lee

                         Sure. -- Of course, thanks.

                                     SCULLY
                         Now here's something, friends, ye 
                         couldn't hope to find in the Waldorf. 
                         Ye see?
                              (he pours a slashing 
                              tinkle of ice-
                              splintery water into 
                              the first basin)
                         What would ye git there?
                              (contemptuously)
                         Shteem! Where fer the chills there's 
                         nuthin' on earth to set the blood 
                         hummin' agin like a bit o' nice brisk 
                         water.
                              (Meantime, he is 
                              filling two more 
                              basins)
                         Ye don't believe me?
                              (to the Easterner)
                         Don't be shy! try it! You'll see.
                              (The Easterner plunges; 
                              the instant the water 
                              hits his face he 
                              utters four sharp 
                              coughs, but he stays 
                              at it and emerges 
                              gasping and groping; 
                              Scully produces a 
                              towel he grabbed 
                              from a shelf under 
                              the tub and now says 
                              with an air of great 
                              graciousness)
                         Yer towel, sir.

                                     SCULLY
                         Yer towel, sir.
                              (same old towel)

               DOLLY along to the Swede, eyes downcast and shifting a little; 
               he plants his heavy fingers in the water up to their second 
               knuckles, and quickly withdraws them, quailing profoundly.

                                     SCULLY
                              (handing out the towel, 
                              now quite draggled, 
                              politely but with 
                              less enthusiasm)
                         Yer towel, sir.

               The Swede sinks one finger at a time into the towel and 
               twists.

               CLOSE UP -- THE EASTERNER

               He is looking into a mirror. His skin shines as if he had 
               used some kind of metal polish on it; he is quietly surprised 
               and pleased. He glances down casually to see if his nails 
               are clean.

               CLOSE UP -- THE COWBOY

               Also gazing into the mirror. He has the same burnished look 
               of metal polished. Impersonal light eyes, a little bit bovine, 
               very virile and empty, fixed through most of the shot on his 
               hair, which he is tidying with a public comb. His eyes rake 
               down, casually and impersonally across his face at the finish 
               of the shot.

               CLOSE UP -- THE SWEDE

               He is twisting his fingers, one by one, heavily in the towel; 
               by the angle of his eyes and their surreptition, it is clear 
               that he is very carefully watching the other three men in 
               the mirror. At the end of the shot, Scully walks into it as 
               the Swede drops the towel beside the basin. The Swede turns 
               for the door, Scully picks up the towel, tosses it into a 
               cardboard box, CAMERA SWINGING as they make for the door.

                              (in re the towel)
                         Thank you.
                              (calling after them)
                         Now just make yerselves comfortable 
                         by the stove, gintlemen. It won't be 
                         no time till dinner.

               They start through the door.

               back his chair to make room.

                         That a fact.

                         Big wind acomin' too, shouldn't 
                         wonder.

                                     COWBOY
                         Shouldn't wonder.

                                     FARMER
                         No sir, shouldn't wonder if we git 
                         us a real ole fashion' blizzard. If

                         I was down to Omahaw; a little 
                         business.

                                     FARMER
                         An' where might ye be headin'?

                         Got me a little ranch, up near the 
                         Dakota line.

                                     FARMER
                         That a fact? Stoppin' over fer the 
                         Spur train, 's 'at right?

                                     COWBOY
                         That's right.

                                     FARMER
                         Myself, I'm a farmer.

                         That right?

                                     FARMER
                         Yup. That's right. Started as a 
                         homesteader, back in seventy-six, 
                         but now I own muh land.

                         Uh huh.

                                     FARMER
                         Yup. Quarter section. When I come 
                         here it warn't nuthin' but a untamed 
                         wilderness like you might say. But 
                         now I own me a quarter section.

               A silence. Farmer spits again, then addresses the Easterner.

                                     FARMER
                         An' what might yer own business be, 
                         stranger, if ye don't mind my askin'?

                                     EASTERNER
                         Not at all, sir. I'm a journalist. 
                         Newspaper man.

                                     FARMER
                         Now is that a fact?
                              (carefully)
                         Not meaning no offense, you're from 
                         the east, ain't you?

                                     EASTERNER
                              (smiling)
                         Yes.
                              (against his natural 
                              reticence)
                         A Philadelphia paper.

                                     FARMER
                         Is that right now. Well, not meanin' 
                         no offense, I'm mighty glad to hear 
                         that.

                                     EASTERNER
                              (smiling)
                         Why's that, sir?

                                     FARMER
                         I was skeered ye might be from Noo 
                         York City. Not that I've ever laid 
                         eyes on one, an' o' course, it could 
                         be I heared wrong. But what ye hear 
                         tell...
                              (a half silent 
                              whistling whew with 
                              a shake of the head)
                         ...them Noo Yorkers!
                              (Uneasy glance at the 
                              Swede; tactful change 
                              of subject)
                         But they ain't never nuthin' happens 
                         out here, Mister, not that's fer the 
                         nooze papers. -- Is they?

                                     EASTERNER
                         Well, you see, I'm not after news 
                         stories just now.
                              (politely)
                         Back east we're all so ignorant of 
                         the rest of the country, that's all. 
                         I am too, and I don't like to be 
                         ignorant. I just want to learn what 
                         things are really like, If I can, 
                         and tell others who don't know, you 
                         see.

                                     FARMER
                              (chews it over, 
                              interested but puzzled)
                         An' they'll pay ye a livin' fer that?

                                     EASTERNER
                              (smiling)
                         That's right.

                                     FARMER
                         But if ye don't mind me askin', why 
                         how come ye coms to Rawmpr? Ain't 
                         nuthin' ever happens here.

                                     EASTERNER
                              (careful and very 
                              polite but candid)
                         Frankly I didn't know I was getting 
                         off till I got here. Seeing it from 
                         the train, I just felt I couldn't go 
                         on by without seeing more of the 
                         Blue Hotel.

                                     FARMER
                         Blue Hotel! Oh! You mean right where 
                         we're sett'n'?

               The Easterner nods, smiling.

                                     FARMER
                         Well, I ain't no proper jedge, but 
                         the woman, she thinks it's mighty 
                         purty.

                                     EASTERNER
                         I never saw a color like it. Not on 
                         a hotel.

                                     FARMER
                         Is that a fact now? Well I'll be 
                         dogged.
                              (pause. To the Swede)
                         An' how 'bout you, Mister, if ye 
                         don't mind me askin'? Where might 
                         you be from?

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               MOVING CLOSE SHOT -- ALCOVE OF THE DINING ROOM

               CAMERA VERTICAL over the dining table, starting at the head, 
               pulling down along the aisle of places moderately slow. 
               Perhaps one or two heads ad lib into the shot, ducking over 
               the plate for a bite, but except for this, heads are not 
               visible -- only what is on the table, and the busily eating 
               and reaching hands. Subdued SOUNDS of shy, speechless, hungry 
               eating. The food is all on the table and by evidence of damage 
               done, we are well on into the meal. Voices are very sporadic 
               and ad lib, possibly recognizable; close to monosyllabic and 
               wholly utilitarian except for the Easterner.

                                     AD LIBS
                         Meat please... Pass the potatoes... 
                         Turnips.

               They are passed, used and returned without comment. A hand 
               and fork reach to spear a biscuit.

                                     EASTERNER
                         Could I have the butter, please.

               An almost inaudible "Sure," in reply and

                                     EASTERNER
                              (quietly)
                         Thanks.

               The voices are o.s., such hands as reach deeper into the 
               terrain than the eating plates, appear at unpredictable angles 
               and rhythms; perhaps two might also collide and spring apart 
               with the almost electric-shock celerity of shy courtesy. Not 
               more than ten seconds to this VERTICAL PULL before we begin 
               to hit barren space, the tundra-like lower reaches of the 
               table, all much-mended, not perfectly clean, white tablecloth, 
               no places set. After just a little of this, CAMERA begins to 
               tilt and settle so that as it reaches the end of the long 
               table, (room for a crowded 14) it is at eye level of a seated 
               man looking up the center of the table at Scully at the head. 
               Along l.s., the Swede (next Scully), and Johnnie; r.s., the 
               Cowboy, (next to Scully) then the Easterner and the Farmer. 
               We pause just long enough to get a glimpse of Scully's 
               character through his eating: a business-like but rather 
               frugal and finicky eater, even a touch of old-maidishness; 
               an old fashioned and rather cute old guy; absorbed in eating, 
               he loses entirely his Mine Host mannerisms, he's just an 
               aging pappy at home, reloading. Rather frail eyelids and 
               stretched neck when he drinks water; an evidently self-taught 
               but deeply habitual care to take small bites and to keep his 
               lips closed over his chewing; dabby with his fork; delicate 
               at harpooning a biscuit; a suggestion of dental plates which 
               don't quite fit.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- THE SWEDE

               A big napkin is tied under his ears, its knot-ends make spare 
               ears below his own. He is sweating a little. He uses his 
               fork left-handed and upside down, European style. He eats 
               steadily with heavy square gestures, and we see in his eating 
               and chewing a conflict between the hunger of a fairly heavy 
               eater and his uneasiness. He is intensely silent and his 
               eyes are darting all over the joint with a dog's eating-
               vigilance plus his own special kind of uneasiness. Elbows 
               wide and clumsy, he usually grazes Johnnie and as CAMERA 
               pulls to the left losing the Swede and picking up Johnnie, 
               the elbows collide rather hard and the first we see of 
               Johnnie's face involves a spasm of annoyance.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- THE COWBOY FROM JOHNNIE'S ANGLE

               The Cowboy is winking at Johnnie, amused.

               CLOSE SHOT -- JOHNNIE

               He watches the Swede. A small, sour smile, friendly eyes, in 
               reaction to the Cowboy. His eating is the normal fast heavy 
               eating of a not very well mannered, far from meek, kid, 
               exactly on the watershed between being a boy and a very young 
               man.

               CLOSE UP -- THE COWBOY

               A napkin tucked fairly high into his dark shirt, his large 
               elbows held in with unaccustomed tightness. His eating system 
               is to mash whatever can be mashed into malleable material, 
               mix it, load his fork by help of his knife as heavy as 
               possible, sculpture and trim it with his knife; changes fork 
               to right hand, brings it up to a mouth which opens for it 
               and closes over it as efficiently as a steamshovel, then 
               working his full jaws with a fair amount of SOUND which he 
               keeps reasonably subdued, meanwhile lowering his fork, 
               changing hands, and starting all over again. He swallows 
               exactly as soon as the new load is ready and takes a swallow 
               of water just before shifting the fork to the right hand: 
               solid machine-like reciprocation between knife, fork, left 
               hand, right hand, mouth and water glass. Otherwise, as a 
               rule, his eyes are either attentive to his plate, or out of 
               focus.

               PULL CAMERA TO THE RIGHT, losing the Cowboy and picking up 
               the Easterner: his are the ordinary eating manners of a well-
               brought-up middle-class Easterner, shaded by his own 
               considerable natural elegance. The modestly hearty appetite 
               of a small healthy man. Small, strong, fine hands. As with 
               his way of speaking, he neither obtrudes nor tries to conceal 
               or modify what is natural to him or to his background. He is 
               a clear master at seeing everything there is to be seen 
               without appearing to stare, or to sneak glances, or even to 
               look, or even to be careful not to look. As the CAMERA leaves 
               him, PULLING RIGHT, he touches his mouth with his napkin, 
               which has been in his lap.

               TAIL OFF briefly on the Farmer, napkin tucked broad over bib 
               of overalls, hard, heavy-knuckled red-looking hands: looking 
               at nobody; hoeing it in; an aging, hard working countryman, 
               at home at this table, and unself-conscious of strangers.

               MEDIUM SHOT -- THE WHOLE TABLE FROM THE EMPTY END

               They are all eating slower, the tail-end of the meal. AD LIB 
               and unobtrusively behind this, is Scully's daughter moving, 
               waiting on table, silently. She is a pale, melancholic, pious, 
               once-pretty spinster of about 30. By-play and reaction between 
               her and the diners should be present but minimal, and played 
               ad lib in passing, never pointed up.

               Scully rearranges himself to lean back in his chair and puts 
               his hands on the table. A heavy silence as they dab at their 
               food.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- THE SWEDE

               His eyes angle sharply to the Cowboy and then to the 
               Easterner.

               TWO SHOT -- THE EASTERNER AND THE COWBOY FROM SWEDE'S ANGLE

               The Easterner catches the Swede's eye, looks quickly down. 
               The Cowboy's eyes up; down. The Easterner looks up again 
               with an inevitable tinge of surreptition.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- THE SWEDE

               The Swede is disturbed by the Easterner's look; glances 
               sharply to the Cowboy.

               TWO SHOT -- THE EASTERNER AND THE COWBOY FROM SWEDE'S ANGLE

               The Cowboy looks up with inevitable surreptition.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- THE SWEDE

               The Swede is still more worried. Gives Scully a sharp glance.

               CLOSE SHOT -- SCULLY FROM THE SWEDE'S ANGLE

               He looks up at the worried look, quickly down again; up again, 
               slyly.

               CLOSE SHOT -- THE SWEDE

               Eyes sidelong to Johnnie, very sly and worried, then to the 
               Easterner and the Cowboy, intensely suspicious and deeply 
               worried.

               TWO SHOT -- THE EASTERNER AND THE COWBOY FROM THE SWEDE'S 
               ANGLE

               The Cowboy looks up in flat perplexity; the Easterner looks 
               up in curiosity so veiled it looks almost criminal; then he 
               looks down; then the Easterner and the Cowboy glance toward 
               each other, each rather secretly, checking if the other had 
               noticed anything odd; it looks very much like complicity.

               CLOSE SHOT -- THE SWEDE

               Very deeply bothered, he rakes his glance at each man in 
               turn, then sharply up at the wall above Scully.

               INSERT: WALL ABOVE SCULLY FROM SWEDE'S ANGLE A SOMBER STEEL 
               ENGRAVING OF "THE STAG AT BAY."

               CLOSE SHOT -- THE SWEDE

               The Swede's eyes leave the engraving, quick glances all around 
               again; he is sweating. He looks into his plate and at his 
               heavy hands on either side of it. He is working hard to brace 
               himself, he begins to get brave and to resolve himself; at 
               last he determines to speak.

                                     SWEDE
                              (to Scully)
                         Me, I come from New York City.

               The Swede casts quick somber eyes at the Farmer.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- THE FARMER FROM THE SWEDE'S ANGLE

               His fork hesitates a fraction near his mouth and goes in 
               fast. The Farmer looks oven more absorbedly into his plate.

                                     SCULLY
                              (juicily polite)
                         Do ye now! Now isn't that intristin'! 
                         Isn't that fascinatin'! A great city. 
                         Ah a great city. Well I remember me 
                         own arrival.

                                     SWEDE
                         You come from New York too?

                                     SCULLY
                         No, I only seen it fer a matter of 
                         days.

               The daughter passes behind them; bread pudding to each.

                                     SCULLY
                         My home was Bahstin Mass.

               Every one quietly starting to eat dessert.

                                     SWEDE
                         I lived there ten years.

                                     SCULLY
                         Tin yearrs. Ye don't say. Tin years. 
                         A great city.

                                     SWEDE
                         Before that I come from Sweden.

                                     SCULLY
                         Ye don't say. Fine people, the Swedes.

                                     SWEDE
                         In New York I was a tailor.

                                     SCULLY
                         A tayylor! Ye don't say! A tailor ye 
                         say. Now isn't that simply 
                         fascinatin'.
                              (to the table at large)
                         The gintleman here tells me he was a 
                         tailor. Isn't that intristin'!

                                     SWEDE
                         Yah: tailor.

                                     SCULLY
                         Well sir, tailorin' I never learned. 
                         Ye might call me a jack of all trades 
                         and master o' none, exceptin' 
                         hotelkeeping...
                              (laughs modestly, 
                              glancing hopefully 
                              around the table)
                         ...but tailorin', no, that's a mystery 
                         to me... It must be a fascinatin' 
                         trade.

                                     SWEDE
                              (dead silence)

                                     SCULLY
                         Hard on the eyes, maybe.

                                     SWEDE
                              (More silence; his 
                              eyes go again to 
                              Scully; a kind of 
                              suspicion is in them, 
                              and in his voice)
                         How long you been here?

                                     SCULLY
                         Fourteen years this last August I 
                         came here and I never had cause to 
                         regret it. A good town, sir. Good 
                         neighbors.

               Scully beams a little nervously, glancing around.

                                     SWEDE
                         What are the crops?

                                     SCULLY
                         Wheat, sir. That's the main crop, ye 
                         might say the only crop. Wheat.
                              (Eyes and polite 
                              gesture to angle of 
                              Farmer)
                         Here's a man kin tell ye all there 
                         is to know about wheat, can't ye 
                         Henry? Henry's a wheat farmer.

               The Cowboy and the Easterner are eating very quietly.

               The Farmer nods, saying nothing.

                                     SCULLY
                         Splindid soil. Rich as cheese. Some 
                         farms here, the yield is up to thirty-
                         five bushels to the acre.
                              (to the Farmer)
                         Isn't that correct?

               The Farmer nods.

                                     SCULLY
                         Last summer at the best it brought 
                         20 cents a bushel. So ye can readily 
                         see it's a prosperous community.
                              (A rather wretched 
                              smile)
                         Plain but prosperous.
                              (More silence)
                         There are farmers hereabouts who are 
                         to be accounted as wealthy men.
                              (Silence)
                         Farmers, mind ye.
                              (To table at large, 
                              almost pleadingly)
                         Wealthy!

               MEDIUM SHOT -- SCULLY FROM THE SWEDE'S ANGLE

               Appalled, his glasses wobble on his nose. SOUND of Swede's 
               laughter o.s.

               MEDIUM SHOT -- COWBOY, EASTERNER AND FARMER -- FROM SWEDE'S 
               ANGLE

               The Cowboy's jaw hangs open as if he were dead; in the 
               Easterner, a far more sophisticated astonishment and 
               wondering; the Farmer scowls more with puzzlement than anger; 
               all dead silent, hands of all three arrested; continue Swede's 
               laughter o.s.

               CLOSE SHOT -- SWEDE'S HEAD

               Laughing and gleaming and glinting at them in great amusement 
               and a glitter of fear.

               GROUP SHOT -- FULL LENGTH OF TABLE

               Towards Scully. Everyone motionless and silent except the 
               Swede, all heads gawping at him: he is rocking with laughter 
               and quietly raising his heavy hands an inch from the table 
               and slapping them down again, over and over.

                                                                 SLOW FADE:

               FADE IN:

               CLOSE SHOT -- THROUGH THE FRONT WINDOW OF THE MAIN ROOM

               Extreme violence of snow and wind, the only visual anchorage 
               is a blanched gate post leaning rigid into it. SOUNDS of 
               strong wind, shut away, and of snow against the window pane. 
               PULL BACK as Scully's aging hand releases a harsh ornate 
               lace curtain he has pulled back, and BACK PAST SCULLY turning 
               his face in CLOSE UP from the window, smiling, and announcing 
               to the room at large:

                                     SCULLY
                         A real old-fashioned blizzard, 
                         gintlemen.
                              (Almost proprietary 
                              about it)

               FULL SHOT -- DOWN THE ROOM FROM SCULLY'S ANGLE

               They are all filing in from the dining room past the stove 
               in the profoundly relaxed few moments of shapeless drifting 
               after a satisfying meal. In their whole demeanor and tone of 
               voice there is absolute security; total lack of personal 
               connection with the blizzard except the pleasure of being 
               indoors.

                                     EASTERNER
                              (forward along l.s. 
                              and drifting toward 
                              the center)
                         I should say it is.
                              (he continues leisurely 
                              across the room 
                              fishing in his pocket 
                              for a cigarette)

               The Cowboy is a little behind the Easterner.

                                     COWBOY
                         Sure looks like it.

               A little right of center he slowly turns his back, getting 
               out tobacco sack and papers. The Easterner by now is lighting 
               up. The Swede walks much more slowly, beveling almost straight 
               toward the CAMERA, deeper towards us than any of the others, 
               eyes on angle of window; slowly prodding tobacco into his 
               pipe. His comment is a scarcely audible breathing; in his 
               face is already the beginning of a strange excitement as he 
               watches through the window and approaches it.

                                     SWEDE
                              (with a strange, 
                              private excitement, 
                              almost a whisper)
                         Yaahh!

               The Farmer, meanwhile, swings in just behind the chairs at 
               the stove. He utters the quiet gasp of total belly-
               satisfaction, an "ahhh" not unlike Titus Moody's to Fred 
               Allen, but earthier. He is loosening his belt and contentedly 
               fingering through a gap in his shirt to scratch his belly. 
               Johnnie is in, silent, between the chair and the stove. The 
               Easterner starts glancing at the news headlines; the Cowboy 
               starts slowly toward the stove; the Swede continues very 
               ponderously and slowly toward the CAMERA and the window.

               MEDIUM SHOT -- PAST EASTERNER TOWARD SCULLY; SWEDE IN B.G.; 
               COWBOY LEAVING R.S.

                                     SCULLY
                              (sharply)
                         Johnnie! Lay on more coal.

               MEDIUM SHOT -- PAST EASTERNER TOWARD JOHNNIE BACK OF COWBOY 
               AND FARMER

                                     JOHNNIE
                         Want to burn the place down?

               The Easterner turns to face the room. CUT IN MID-TURN.

               MEDIUM SHOT -- SCULLY PAST EASTERNER

               Advancing from the window and leaning to peer toward the 
               stove.

                                     SCULLY
                         Sure, it's rid hot now.

               He comes down to the middle of the room, the CAMERA with 
               him, losing the Swede, still talking.

                                     SCULLY
                              (continuing)
                         I tell ye, friends, there's nuthin' 
                         like a chair beside a stove...

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- THE EASTERNER

               His eyes and head following Scully who is already out of 
               shot toward the stove. The Easterner is lazily and happily 
               observant.

                                     SCULLY'S VOICE
                              (o.s.)
                         ...to make ye shpit 'n the eye...

               MEDIUM SHOT -- FROM EASTERNER'S ANGLE TOWARD SCULLY and the 
               group coalescing toward the stove.

                                     SCULLY
                              (back to CAMERA)
                         ...o' the worst weather Heaven kin 
                         send.

                                     COWBOY
                              (absently; contentedly)
                         That's right.

               The startling SOUND, o.s., of hollowed palms being clapped 
               together.

               MEDIUM SHOT -- SWEDE FROM EASTERNER'S ANGLE

               Pipe clenched, a queer grin on his face, just finishing his 
               handclap of solitary excitement and pleasure.

               CLOSE UP -- EASTERNER

               Much interested, his eyes flick from the Swede's angle to 
               the angle of the stove and the group; the newspaper droops 
               in his hand.

               MEDIUM SHOT -- GROUP AT STOVE FROM EASTERNER'S ANGLE

               They have noticed nothing.

                                     SCULLY
                         Well, I'll be off about me dooties 
                         if you'll excuse me gintlemen.

                                     COWBOY
                         Sure. So long.

                                     EASTERNER'S VOICE
                              (o.s.)
                         Certainly.

               Scully crosses up the room toward l.s. CAMERA FOLLOWING, 
               losing the group.

                                     JOHNNIE'S VOICE
                              (o.s.)
                         How 'bout it? Ready to get skinned 
                         alive again?

               GROUP SHOT -- FROM EASTERNER'S ANGLE -- FARMER AT CENTER

                                     FARMER
                         Son, day I see you skin a gopher 
                         I'll deed ye my farm, an' my old 
                         woman throwed in.

               SOUND of a squeaky hinge across this.

               MEDIUM SHOT -- SCULLY FROM EASTERNER'S ANGLE

               Going through the little swinging gate by the registration 
               desk.

               GROUP SHOT -- JOHNNIE CENTERED

                                     JOHNNIE
                         Be good thing for your land and a 
                         mercy for your wife.

                                     COWBOY
                         Ouch!

                                     FARMER
                              (approaching the table)
                         Jest get busy with that skinnin', 
                         son, loud talk never proved nuthin'.

                                     COWBOY
                              (swinging chair into 
                              place)
                         I want to see this.

               The Easterner walks into the shot as they severally arrange 
               chairs, cards and chips and start to settle down.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- FARMER -- PAST JOHNNIE

               Farmer sits in original position; Johnnie nearest the coatroom 
               and with his back to it. They are cutting for deal and the 
               Cowboy and the Easterner, who are doing the last necessary 
               hiking of chairs, look on.

               LONG SHOT -- SWEDE FROM SAME ANGLE

               His rigid, leaning stance has been four feet or so from the 
               window. He is now very close to the window and is just pulling 
               under himself a small stool. o.s. THE SOUND of the oily whirr 
               of expert shuffling.

               CLOSE SHOT -- SWEDE FROM THE SAME ANGLE

               The window is beyond him, his eyes are fixed deep into the 
               snow. o.s. SOUNDS of dealing and ad lib bidding. CAMERA PULLS 
               SLOWLY around so that the Swede is in still larger close up, 
               filling most of the screen. He is looking out intensely past 
               the CAMERA, giving tiny, rapid pulls on his pipe; his face 
               showing signs of an inexplicable excitement; eyes becoming 
               almost dreamy. CAMERA SLOWLY TURNS square on the window to 
               focus on what his eyes are fixed on, -- the post. Storm SOUNDS 
               UP and card SOUNDS FADING to inaudibility. DISSOLVE to snow 
               higher on post and, almost immediately, A LOUD SLAPPING DOWN 
               OF CARDS and the Farmer's angry voice and the scrape of a 
               chair.

               EXTREME CLOSE UP -- SWEDE

               Deep fright and guile in the face and a strange and malignant 
               smile.

               MEDIUM SHOT -- FARMER FROM JOHNNIE'S ANGLE

               He is just finishing standing up, a look of heated scorn on 
               his face.

                                     JOHNNIE
                         Too bad. Poor feller just ought to 
                         leave cards alone.
                              (They nod; they are 
                              wholly on his side)
                         Or his temper, one or the other.

                                     COWBOY
                         That's right. Ye can't afford a 
                         temper, not if ye play much cards.

                                     EASTERNER
                         Or cards, if you have a temper.

                                     COWBOY
                              (chuckles)
                         Mister, ya got sumpn' there.

                                     JOHNNIE
                         How 'bout a whirl at four-handed; or 
                         do you reckon we can keep from bitin' 
                         each other's heads off?

                                     COWBOY
                              (heavy jocosity)
                         Buster, my gun's right on the table 
                         so don't try nuthin' fancy.

                                     EASTERNER
                              (smiling with Cowboy)
                         We might draw up a treaty of non-
                         aggression.

                                     COWBOY
                         Reckon I'll throw in with you, 
                         Johnnie, you look like a mean man to 
                         have agin ye.

                                     EASTERNER
                              (in a low voice)
                         Better make sure the Swede'll play.

                                     COWBOY
                         Hey buddy.

                                     JOHNNIE
                         Hey Mister.

                                     EASTERNER
                         I beg your pardon.

                                     SWEDE
                         Hehnh?

                                     EASTERNER
                         I wondered if you'd be my par --

                                     JOHNNIE
                         How 'bout a little game?

               Uneasy but determined to show everyone that he is not afraid.

                                     SWEDE
                         Yeh? What kind of a game?

                                     JOHNNIE
                         High Five.

                                     SWEDE
                         Never heard of it.

                                     COWBOY'S VOICE
                         Some call it Cinch.

                                     JOHNNIE'S VOICE
                         Ain't no cinch the way that poor 
                         Farmer plays it.

                                     EASTERNER'S VOICE
                         Some call it Double Pedro.

                                     COWBOY
                         Never knowed that.

                                     SWEDE
                         Ohh. Yaah. Double Pedro. Is that it.

                                     JOHNNIE
                         Five o' trumps yer Pedro, five o' 
                         same color's yer left,...

                                     SWEDE'S VOICE
                              (across him)
                         Yah.

                                     JOHNNIE
                         ...ranks jest below yer five o' 
                         trumps, each count ya ten points.

                                     SWEDE
                         Yaahh. Suure I played it.
                              (sharp pause)
                         For money you mean?

                                     JOHNNIE
                         Either way suits me.

                                     COWBOY'S VOICE
                         Let's just play for fun.

                                     EASTERNER'S VOICE
                         Suits me.

                                     COWBOY
                              (voice up)
                         Just for fun, if that suits you.

                                     SWEDE
                         Fun. Yah. Yah. I play.

                                     EASTERNER'S VOICE
                              (o.s.)
                         Fine.

               They all pull up their chairs. The Swede laughs shrilly and 
               strangely.

               CLOSE SHOT -- EASTERNER FROM THE SWEDE'S ANGLE

               He looks up quickly at the Swede (lens)

               CLOSE SHOT -- COWBOY FROM JOHNNIE'S ANGLE

               His jaw drops open, his head and eyes toward the Swede.

               CLOSE SHOT -- JOHNNIE FROM THE COWBOY'S ANGLE

               Not really looking except very quietly, 'as if from under 
               his eyes', holding the cards with still fingers.

               CLOSE SHOT -- JOHNNIE PAST COWBOY AND EASTERNER

               His hands still suspended motionless.

                                     JOHNNIE
                         Well, let's get at it. Come on now!

               Faint nods of agreement and shiftings forward as they begin 
               to cut for deal.

               CLOSE SHOT -- JOHNNIE'S HANDS SHUFFLING THE CARDS

               He is a very fast shuffler. We watch him finishing one whirr, 
               and through another, then he puts the cards toward the Swede 
               for the cut, the CAMERA FOLLOWING AND PULLING BACK. The Swede 
               slowly and seriously cuts the deck three ways as the CAMERA 
               RECEDES AND RISES to take in his face and Johnnie's. He is 
               smiling at Johnnie who seems about to speak -- not quarrel-
               somely exactly -- but lets it go and starts gathering in the 
               deck.

               CLOSE VERTICAL SHOT -- OVER TABLE

               Johnnie deals very rapidly, three cards to a man at a time, 
               the CAMERA following the cards around and the eyes of the 
               four men following too. The Swede picks up his first three 
               cards as quick as they fall, the others leave theirs on the 
               table. He instantly takes them in so close to his chest that, 
               in looking, he is like a woman looking down the front of her 
               dress.

               "CIRCULAR" SHOT

               They all pick up their cards and look and arrange them.

               CAMERA ON SWEDE -- EASTERNER'S VOICE BIDDING

               CAMERA ON EASTERNER -- SWEDE'S VOICE BIDDING

               CAMERA ON COWBOY -- JOHNNIE'S VOICE PASSING

               The Swede's VOICE names the trump suit.

               VERTICAL SHOT OF TABLE

               The players discard, face up. (They have been dealt nine 
               cards each). They lay them down almost simultaneously: The 
               Easterner 7, the Cowboy 7, the Swede 5 and Johnnie 8. The 
               Cowboy WHISTLES softly.

               THREE SHOT -- SWEDE CENTERED

               Johnnie fills for them. 4 to the Easterner, 4 to the Cowboy 
               and 1 to the Swede.

               THREE SHOT -- JOHNNIE CENTERED

               He robs the deck for 5 cards.

               "CIRCULAR" SHOT

               The Swede leads, Johnnie lays a card out, then the Easterner, 
               then the Cowboy. The Cowboy lays his first card down quietly 
               but already his face, especially the eyes, have strangely 
               altered. He seems essentially quite a gentle guy but the 
               usually rather slow eyes are bright and ruthless. THE SHOT 
               CONTINUES to the Swede as he rakes in a trick and leads his 
               next card; past Johnnie for his and the Easterner for his to 
               the Cowboy who, with a face like the Archangel Michael goosing 
               Satan, WHAMS down his card.

               THREE SHOT -- SWEDE, JOHNNIE, EASTERNER

               The instant the card hits the table with its startling noise, 
               the Swede jumps with fright, is mad at being scared and flicks 
               a smoldering, mean eye at the Cowboy.

               Johnnie is mildly startled and quietly amused, much aware of 
               the reactions of the other two.

               The Easterner flinches with startlement; mildly annoyed; a 
               little annoyed with himself for being annoyed; an automatic 
               and almost successful effort to show nothing.

               CAMERA ON EASTERNER AND COWBOY -- EASTERNER PLAYING

               THREE SHOT -- FROM COWBOY'S ANGLE

               As the hand and card WHAM down again, Johnnie's eyes go to 
               the Cowboy, more amused. The two others take care not to 
               look up.

               CLOSE UP -- COWBOY FROM JOHNNIE'S ANGLE

               He is on top of the world.

               CLOSE UP -- THE SWEDE

               SOUND of shuffling. His face has begun to darken, swell and 
               crease; he is looking dull daggers toward the Cowboy from 
               under his brows; sore as a boil. It is clear the Cowboy has 
               busted hell out of his bid.

               CLOSE UP -- EASTERNER

               SOUND OF cowboy's VOICE bidding. The Easterner is sizing him 
               up with care; he is a little annoyed and shaken, but a 
               disciplined man.

               CLOSE UP -- JOHNNIE

               He is playing a card, eyes very watchful of his two opponents 
               and still more amused. He knows how sore they are getting 
               and how off-their-game it is putting them.

               CLOSE UP -- COWBOY

               Still more tickled with himself and more ruthless than before. 
               WHAM.

                                     COWBOY
                         Bullet by golly.

               NEW CLOSE UP -- COWBOY

               Still more so than before. WHAM.

                                     COWBOY
                         Reckon that'll learn ye.

               NEW CLOSE UP -- COWBOY

               A card lifted high to wham, then laid out quite gently.

                                     COWBOY
                         Reckon we'll leave um take this-un 
                         Johnnie-boy, sure looks like they 
                         could use it.

               WHAM on CLOSE UP OF SWEDE By now boiling internally, he 
               sullenly plays his card.

               WHAM on CLOSE UP OF EASTERNER Managing almost perfectly to 
               control his wincing and hide his anger.

               WHAM on CLOSE UP OF JOHNNIE Eyes quick at Swede and the 
               Easterner, just managing to hold in his laughter.

               WHAM on CLOSE UP OF COWBOY Sweat bright on his forehead, his 
               tie and collar loosened, impervious to their anger; happy as 
               a clam.

               WHAM on CLOSE UP OF JOHNNIE He can no longer contain his 
               laughter.

               WHAM on CLOSE UP OF EASTERNER Looking pinched around the 
               nostrils and pretty sick.

               CLOSE UP -- SWEDE

               Ready for the wham; a light card falls.

                                     COWBOY'S VOICE
                              (o.s.)
                         Reckon we can afford it.

               The Swede does a quiet collapse equivalent to that of leaning 
               against a strong wind which suddenly stops; Johnnie's laughter 
               LOUDENS o.s. The Swede, still wearing coat and vest, is in a 
               great state of dishevelment, sweating hard, miserable; by 
               now he is as mad at quiet cards as at whams and as mad at 
               Johnnie as at the Cowboy.

               WHAM on CLOSE UP OF THE EASTERNER His vest unbuttoned, unable 
               to sit up straight any more; he is smiling bitterly; SOUND 
               of Johnnie's laughter intensifies o.s.

               CLOSE UP -- JOHNNIE

               Weak with laughter, but still at it; by now his shirt is 
               unbuttoned down to the waist and he is sweating with laughter, 
               laughing as much at the Cowboy as at the others.

               CLOSE UP -- COWBOY

               His large, thick, long red neck sprouting enormously from a 
               tie and collar still more awry than before; aware he too is 
               being laughed at but stolidly and hugely pleased with himself: 
               eyes to all three players: WHAM.

               The CAMERA lifts and loses his head and shoots over it and 
               the slickening SOUND of the cards, up the length of the room, 
               centering on the window and the wild snowing outside: ordinary 
               full daylight: HOLD, fading the card SOUNDS and the laughter 
               and the beat of wham almost to inaudibility and whiffling up 
               the blizzard SOUNDS:

                                                                    CUT TO:

               SAME SHOT

               Well into the beginning of dusk; a melancholy and slightly 
               sinister light through the window, touching everything 
               visible; fade card SOUNDS in and up, and Johnnie's laughter, 
               much more tired and habituated; LOWER CAMERA to take Cowboy's 
               head, the kind of guy who never knows when a joke stops being 
               a joke; another full-sized WHAM;

                                         CUT OVER JOHNNIE'S FIRST WORDS TO:

               MEDIUM SHOT -- SWEDE, JOHNNIE, EASTERNER from COWBOY'S ANGLE 
               Johnnie is practically sick with laughter; the other two are 
               beat-out and sick to death of it. They are almost sorer at 
               Johnnie than at Cowboy and show it in their hangdog glances 
               at him.

                                     JOHNNIE
                         Haahh, Lordy, I could die laughin'!

               The Swede, and even the Easterner, flick him bitter glances. 
               Johnnie relaxes still more limp in his chair, tears on his 
               cheeks, catching their hard looks and totally unmoved; just 
               another whicker of laughter at them.

                                     COWBOY'S VOICE
                              (o.s.)
                         Your deal Johnnie, and you'd better 
                         give the other boys some cards for a 
                         change. They sure look like they 
                         could use a few.

                                     JOHNNIE
                         Gett'n' chilly in here.
                              (looking up and around)
                         Hey, it's gett'n' dark.

               MEDIUM SHOT -- FROM MIDDLE OF ROOM

               They all look up and around towards the window and realize 
               it for the first time. Johnnie gets up; behind the following 
               lines he puts on coal:

                                     EASTERNER
                         Hmm!
                              (he acts bemused coming 
                              out of deep 
                              concentration on the 
                              cards)

               A pause. From mid-room, in the fading light, we watch them 
               watching the darkening, the strange light on their faces, 
               the faces calming, even saddening a little.

                                     COWBOY
                              (quietly)
                         Snow sure does look blue, this time 
                         a day.

               The Easterner nods; a little surprised that Cowboy notices 
               it.

                                     COWBOY
                         Funny, cause snow ain't blue, it's 
                         white. Snow white, like they say.

               The Easterner smiles very quietly.

                                     COWBOY
                         Reckon it's the light.

                                     EASTERNER
                              (nods; then all but 
                              whispers)
                         Yes.

               The Swede, throughout this, is deeply still and withdrawn; 
               his face is preparing, inconspicuously, the strange line on 
               which he will re-enter the conversation.

               Johnnie, finished with the stove, crosses between CAMERA and 
               the table to side table o.s., their eyes follow him quietly, 
               light changes on their faces as, o.s., he lights and turns 
               up a lamp.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- FROM SAME POSITION -- JOHNNIE

               As he finishes with the lamp and leaves the shot, HOLD a 
               moment on the lamp, its light tender and magical in the fading 
               day, and disclosing their faces, still bemused in the 
               ambiguous lightings of the last daylight and of lamplight on 
               in daylight. There is a soft, strange point of light in each 
               eye.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- ON JOHNNIE -- PAST EASTERNER AND COWBOY

               Johnnie reseats himself, pulls up, and gets the deck ready 
               for shuffling; and their heads turn back from the lamp toward 
               the game. Johnnie, realizing the shift and slowing of mood 
               and influenced by it, dawdles a little, more or less idling 
               and toying with the cards. A deeply pleasant and comfortable 
               silence, tinged with the melancholy of dusk.

               SLOW "CIRCULAR" SHOT --

               Beginning on the Easterner's quiet face; then the Cowboy's 
               (past him we see the whole room and the darkening window); 
               then the Swede whose strange eyes still catch the lamplight; 
               then Johnnie, ready to resume playing but waiting for them. 
               This shot is to crown and epitomize the mysterious yet 
               peaceful mood -- which is now broken by

                                     SWEDE'S VOICE
                              (o.s., quiet and musing)
                         I suppose there have been a good 
                         many men killed in this room.

               A short, electrified pause.

                                     JOHNNIE
                              (quietly)
                         How's that?

               MEDIUM SHOT -- COWBOY, JOHNNIE, EASTERNER -- FROM THE SWEDE'S 
               ANGLE All looking at the Swede sharply.

               CLOSE UP -- SWEDE

               His eyes move to the Cowboy and the Easterner, then to 
               Johnnie.

                                     SWEDE
                         I said, I suppose there have been a 
                         good many men killed in this room.

               CLOSE UP -- JOHNNIE -- FULL FACE

               A short pause.

                                     JOHNNIE
                         What the divil're you talkin' about?

               QUICK, CLOSE FULL FACES OF THE COWBOY AND THE EASTERNER 
               astounded and intensely curious.

               CLOSE UP -- SWEDE

                                     SWEDE
                              (a blatant laugh, 
                              full of false courage 
                              and defiance)
                         Oh, you know what I mean, all right!

               CLOSE UP -- JOHNNIE

                                     JOHNNIE
                         I'm a liar if I do!

               FAST FLICKED CLOSE SHOTS OF EASTERNER, COWBOY AND JOHNNIE 
               FROM THE SWEDE'S ANGLE

                                     JOHNNIE
                              (very much the son of 
                              the proprietor)
                         Now, what might you be drivin' at, 
                         Mister?

               CLOSE SHOT -- SWEDE FROM EASTERNER'S ANGLE

                                     SWEDE
                              (winks at Johnnie, a 
                              wink full of cunning)
                         Oh, maybe you think I have been to 
                         nowheres. Maybe you think I'm a 
                         tenderfoot?

                                     JOHNNIE
                         I don't know nuthin' about you and I 
                         don't give a whoop where you've been. 
                         All I got to say is I don't know 
                         what you're drivin' at. There hain't 
                         never been nobody killed in this 
                         room.

                                     COWBOY
                              (a sudden swing of 
                              his whole head toward 
                              the Swede)
                         What's wrong with you, Mister?

               ALL FROM SWEDE'S ANGLE, AT SPEED OF FLICKING EYES: Cowboy 
               with the Easterner in the b.g. and slightly blurred focus; 
               Johnnie with the Easterner in the b.g. and slightly blurred 
               focus; the Easterner alone, in sharp focus; all are tightly 
               looking into the Swede's eyes but the Easterner is the only 
               one who looks at all "concerned" or in the least sympathetic.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- SWEDE -- PAST EASTERNER, COWBOY AND 
               JOHNNIE

               He seems to feel he is "formidably menaced". He sends an 
               appealing glance to the Easterner. Start very quietly, bring 
               up ever louder, o.s. SOUND of "some loose thing beating 
               regularly against the clapboards" -- "like a spirit tapping".

                                     SWEDE
                              (mockingly, to 
                              Easterner)
                         They say they don't know what I mean!

                                     EASTERNER
                              (impassively)
                         I don't understand you.

               Johnnie and the Cowboy exchange glances and look to the Swede.

               MEDIUM SHOT -- SWEDE -- PAST EASTERNER: COWBOY AND JOHNNIE 
               FLANKING

                                     SWEDE
                              (shrugging)
                         Oh, I see you are all against me. I 
                         see --

               During the shrug, the CAMERA creeps a little to the r. past 
               the Easterner and bores in on the Swede and the Cowboy, the 
               latter in deep stupefaction and rising impatience. By the 
               time of the second "I see", the CAMERA loses the Swede 
               entirely and the Cowboy, in solitary CLOSE UP, slams down 
               his hands on the board:

                                     COWBOY
                         Say, what're you gett'n' at, hey?

               WHIP CAMERA TO SWEDE AND TILT UP as he springs up with the 
               celerity of a man escaping from a snake on the floor.

                                     SWEDE
                              (standing in tilted 
                              close up from the 
                              angle of the center 
                              of the table)
                         I don't want to fight! I don't want 
                         to fight!

               CLOSE SHOT -- SWEDE (STANDING) -- LEVEL A LITTLE ABOVE THEIR 
               HEADS

               They have saved the table from his sudden getting up; their 
               hands clench it. The Cowboy stretches his long legs insolently 
               and deliberately. He jams his hands deep in his pockets. He 
               spits, twisting past his shoulder, into the cuspidor almost 
               at the Swede's feet.

                                     COWBOY
                              (quiet and contemptuous)
                         Well, who in tarnation thought you 
                         did?

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- SWEDE AND COWBOY

               The Cowboy's turned head and jaw in floor of shot at the 
               beginning; slowly CREEP ON THE SWEDE, gaining a little, losing 
               the Cowboy, as the Swede backs rapidly toward the wall near 
               the coat room, in his eyes, "the dying swan look". The TAPPING 
               outdoors is VERY LOUD by now.

                                     SWEDE
                              (voice quavering)
                         Gentlemen, I suppose I am going to 
                         be killed before I can leave this 
                         house! I suppose I am going to be 
                         killed before I can leave this house!

               SOUND of door opening o.s.

               MEDIUM SHOT -- SCULLY, FROM SAME POSITION, NEW ANGLE

               He enters from his office near the front door. He pauses in 
               surprise.

               MEDIUM SHOT -- SWEDE -- GROUP IN B.G. -- FROM SCULLY'S ANGLE

                                     SWEDE
                              (eagerly and swiftly; 
                              head turning to answer 
                              Scully)
                         These men are going to kill me.

                                     SCULLY
                         Kill you! Kill you? What are you 
                         talkin'?

               The Swede makes the "gesture of a martyr".

                                     SCULLY
                         What is this, Johnnie?

                                     JOHNNIE
                              (sullen, but looking 
                              at Scully)
                         I dunno. I can't make no sense to 
                         it.
                              (eyes drifting, he 
                              begins to shuffle 
                              the cards with an 
                              angry snap)
                         He says a good many men have been 
                         killed in this room, or something 
                         like like that. And he says he's 
                         goin' to be killed here too. I dunno 
                         what ails him. He's crazy, I shouldn't 
                         wonder.

                                     SCULLY
                         Kill you? Kill you? Man, you're off 
                         your nut.

                                     SWEDE
                         Oh, I know. I know what will happen. 
                         Yes, I'm crazy -- yes. But I know 
                         one thing...

               GROUP -- FROM THE SWEDE'S ANGLE

               An almost lightning quick shot of all of them from the Swede's 
               angle.

               CLOSE SHOT -- SWEDE

                                     SWEDE
                         ...I know I won't get out of here 
                         alive.

               HOLD on him, sweating and full of dread, at least three 
               seconds of silence.

               CLOSE UP -- COWBOY

               He "draws a deep breath, as if his mind was passing into the 
               last stages of dissolution".

                                     COWBOY
                              (whispering almost to 
                              himself)
                         Well, I'm doggoned.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- SCULLY

               Wheeling suddenly on Johnnie.

                                     SCULLY
                         You've been troublin' this man!

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- JOHNNIE -- PAST COWBOY, SCULLY IN L.S.

                                     JOHNNIE
                              (loudly; with grievance)
                         Why good night, I ain't done nothin 
                         to 'im!

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- SWEDE -- PAST EASTERNER AND COWBOY, AND 
               PAST SCULLY, STANDING, JUST BEYOND COWBOY

                                     SWEDE
                              (one step forward; 
                              stops)
                         Gentlemen, do not disturb yourselves. 
                         I will leave this house. I will go 
                         away, because --

               He accuses them dramatically with his glance.

               CLOSER SHOT -- SAME ANGLE

                                     SWEDE
                         -- Because I do not want to be killed.

                                     SCULLY
                              (wheeling, furious, 
                              to Johnnie)
                         Will ye tell me what's the matter ye 
                         young divil? What's the matter, 
                         annyhow? Speak out!

                                     JOHNNIE
                         Blame it! I tell you I don't know. 
                         He -- he says we want to kill him, 
                         and that's all I know. I can't tell 
                         what ails him.

                                     SWEDE
                         Never mind Mr. Scully; never mind. I 
                         will leave this house. I will go 
                         away because I do not want to be 
                         killed. Yes, of course, I am crazy -- 
                         yes. But I know one thing! I will go 
                         away. I will leave this house. Never 
                         mind, Mr. Scully; never mind. I will 
                         go away.

                                     SCULLY
                         You will not go away. You will not 
                         go away until I hear the reason of 
                         this business. If anybody has troubled 
                         you I will take care of him. This is 
                         my house. You're under my roof, and 
                         I will not allow any peaceable man 
                         to be troubled here.

                                     SWEDE
                         Never mind, Mr. Scully; never mind. 
                         I know you don't want trouble, but 
                         you can't stop them. Nobody can stop 
                         them, not God Himself.
                              (sad wag of head)
                         No Mr. Scully, I will go away. I do 
                         not wish to be killed. I'll get my 
                         baggage.

               The screen is empty for a moment, then Scully darts into the 
               shot, half across the screen.

                                     SCULLY
                              (peremptorily)
                         No, no!

               MEDIUM SHOT -- SAME POSITION

               Angle for the Swede's "beyond words" backward glance at 
               Scully, and his sad and deliberate exit.

               Scully still transfixed in c.s., looking after the Swede; 
               SOUND of a door closing and the Swede's slow feet on the 
               stairs. He holds, slowly turns, walks slowly and very 
               impressively back toward the table, CAMERA with him.

                                     SCULLY
                         Now. What does this mane?

               CLOSE SHOT -- THE THREE FROM SCULLY'S STOOPED, INVESTIGATORY 
               ANGLE

                                     JOHNNIE AND COWOY
                              (rather loudly and 
                              almost in unison)
                         Why, we didn't do nuthin' to him!

               CLOSE SHOT -- UP AT SCULLY -- FROM EASTERNER'S ANGLE

               So close that Johnnie and the Cowboy are not in the shot.

                                     SCULLY
                              (coldly)
                         No? You didn't?

               CLOSE SHOT -- JOHNNIE -- FROM EASTERNER'S ANGLE

                                     JOHNNIE
                         Why this is the wildest loon I ever 
                         see. We didn't do nuthin' at all. We 
                         were jest sett'n' here playin' cards, 
                         and he...

                                     SCULLY'S VOICE
                              (o.s., interrupting)
                         Mister --

               CLOSE SHOT -- SCULLY -- FROM EASTERNER'S ANGLE -- LOOKING 
               STRAIGHT INTO LENS

                                     SCULLY
                              (solemnly)
                         Mister: what has these boys been 
                         doin'?

               CLOSE SHOT -- EASTERNER -- FROM SCULLY'S ANGLE

                                     EASTERNER
                              (slowly, after a long, 
                              careful pause)
                         I didn't see anything wrong at all.

               PULL BACK to frame in Johnnie and the Cowboy; vindicated and 
               a little smug.

               CLOSE SHOT -- SCULLY

               Miserably and desperately chewing that one over: a sudden 
               outburst.

                                     SCULLY
                              (howling)
                         But what does it mane?
                              (to Johnnie)
                         I've a good mind to lather ye for 
                         this, me boy!

               CLOSE SHOT -- JOHNNIE -- FROM SCULLY'S ANGLE

                                     JOHNNIE
                              (frantic)
                         Well what've I done?

               CLOSE SHOT -- SCULLY -- FROM JOHNNIE'S ANGLE

               CLOSE SHOT -- COWBOY -- FROM SCULLY'S ANGLE

               CLOSE SHOT -- EASTERNER -- FROM SCULLY'S ANGLE

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- SCULLY -- PAST THE THREE

                                     SCULLY
                              (scornfully)
                         I think you are tongue-tied.

               He looks at them 1-2-3 again, turns on his heel; walks toward 
               the stairway door and out of shot, CAMERA LIFTING a trifle 
               to follow.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- THE THREE -- PAST SWEDE'S EMPTY CHAIR

               Over SOUND of closing door and Scully's climbing feet, each 
               looks from one to the other, speechless, dumbfounded.

                                                                QUICK FADE:

               FADE IN:

               CLOSE SHOT -- THE SWEDE'S ROOM (UPSTAIRS)

               The Swede's leaning left shoulder; he is strapping his valise. 
               A LITTLE NOISE; he straightens up wheeling with a loud cry, 
               CAMERA following into CLOSE UP; his terrified eyes are fixed 
               just to the right of the lens.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- SCULLY AT THE OPEN DOOR

               He is carrying a small kerosene lamp which scare-lights his 
               wrinkled face. He should "resemble a murderer" sufficiently 
               to startle even the audience.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- SWEDE -- PAST SCULLY

               Still sick with terror as Scully leaves the dark corridor 
               and enters the lighted room.

                                     SCULLY
                         Man! Man! Have you gone daffy?

               CLOSE TWO SHOT -- SCULLY WALKING INTO SHOT

               Carrying his lamp; ordinary lighting of room.

                                     SWEDE
                         Oh, no! Oh, no!
                              (short pause)
                         There are people in this world who 
                         know pretty nearly as much as you do -- 
                         understand?

               CLOSE SHOT -- SWEDE -- FROM SCULLY'S VIEWPOINT

               On his deathly pale cheeks are two spots, "as sharply edged 
               as if they had been carefully painted". His eyes brighten 
               almost as if with tears. For a moment his mouth trembles; 
               then he makes it firm.

                              profoundly sad)
                         Just one rule, Mr. Scully, and I 
                         learned it young. Don't never trust 
                         nobody. Be ready for anything.

               He looks at Scully, both daring him to contradict, and 
               desperately pleading for assurance that this is not so.

                                     SWEDE
                         My father beat that into me. That's 
                         why I'm alive today.
                              (his pleading, 
                              forbidding look 
                              intensifies)

               CLOSE SHOT -- SCULLY FROM SWEDE'S VIEWPOINT

               Scully means well but all this is far beyond him; besides, 
               he is wholly wrapped up in the immediate situation. He is 
               studying the Swede very carefully, in deep concern and 
               puzzlement. After a moment he puts his lamp on the table and 
               sits on the edge of the bed, CAMERA SWINGING to keep him 
               centered.

               MEDIUM SHOT -- SCULLY R.S. -- SWEDE STANDING L.S.

               AS SCULLY SITS

                              (ruminatively)
                         By cracky, I never heard of such a 
                         thing in my life. It's a complete 
                         muddle. I can't for the soul of me 
                         think how you ever got this idea 
                         into your head.
                              (a short silence)
                         And did you sure think they were 
                         going to kill you?

                                     SWEDE
                              (scans him as if he 
                              wants to see into 
                              his mind. At last, 
                              with a great effort)
                         I did.

               He turns again to the valise straps, back to Scully. His 
               whole arm shakes, his elbow wavering like a bit of paper.

                                     SCULLY
                              (banging impressively 
                              on the footboard of 
                              the bed)
                         Why, man, we're goin' to have a line 
                         of illictric street-cars in this 
                         town next spring.

                              (stupidly, vacantly)
                         A line of electric street-cars.
                              (he gets busy on the 
                              other strap)

                         And there's a new railroad goin' to 
                         be built down from Broken Arm to 
                         here. Not to mention the four churches 
                         and the smashin' big brick 
                         schoolhouse. Then there's the big 
                         factory, too. Why in two years 
                         Rrhahmpr'll be a metropolis.

                              and politely awaits 
                              the termination of 
                              the foregoing lines)

                              (sore; getting up)
                         You don't owe me one red cent.

                                     SWEDE
                         Yes I do.
                              (he takes coins from 
                              his pocket and offers 
                              them to Scully, who 
                              snaps his fingers in 
                              disdainful refusal; 
                              their eyes rest on 
                              the open palm between 
                              them, gazing in a 
                              strange fashion)

               INSERT:

               The open palm, very heavy and alive, tailors' marks and 
               callouses on it, trembling faintly; three quarters on it.

               Their eyes lift from the open palm and meet strangely in 
               silence.

                                     SCULLY
                              (quietly)
                         I'll not take your money. Not after 
                         what's been goin' on here.

               All of a sudden he begins to look very crafty. The Swede 
               watches the change in his face with deep uneasiness.

               CLOSE UP -- THE SWEDE

               His eyes to Scully, looking still more uneasy.

               CLOSE UP -- SCULLY -- FROM SWEDE'S ANGLE

               Looking still more crafty.

                                     SCULLY
                         Here, here!
                              (he turns and picks 
                              up the lamp, CAMERA 
                              following, and comes 
                              back close again, 
                              beckoning, guileful)

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- SWEDE -- PAST SCULLY

               Recoiling in overwhelming alarm.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- SCULLY -- FROM SWEDE'S ANGLE

               Pressing closer; wheedling, crafty.

                                     SCULLY
                         Yes! Come on! I want you to come and 
                         see a pitcher -- just across the 
                         hall -- in my room.

               Swede very close, his teeth shaking like a dead man's; PULL 
               BACK to bring in Scully very close in almost the posture of 
               a Judas about to plant the kiss, eyes slantwise up to the 
               taller man.

                                     SCULLY
                         Come on. There's nuthin' to be afraid 
                         of: Come on.
                              (he starts for the 
                              door)

               PULL CAMERA BACK and lead them out through the door, Scully 
               holding his lamp high, the Swede following with the step of 
               one hung in chains.

               CLOSE SHOT -- SCULLY'S BEDROOM

               The lamp is thrust through darkness high upward against the 
               wall of Scully's room, picking up first a sliding swatch of 
               ornate wallpaper, then a ridiculous photograph of a little 
               girl, the figure graceful as an upright sled-stake. She is 
               the hue of lead. She leans against a balustrade or gorgeous 
               decoration. The formidable bang to her hair is prominent.

                                     SCULLY
                         There, that's the pitcher of my little 
                         girl that died. Her name was Carrie. 
                         She had the purtiest hair you ever 
                         saw.

               PULL BACK to take Scully close, looking up.

                                     SCULLY
                              (continuing)
                         I was that fond of her, she --

               Scully's eyes to the Swede, SWING CAMERA onto the Swede, 
               Scully beyond him. He is not looking either at Scully or the 
               picture but is keeping keen watch on the gloom at the rear.

                                     SCULLY
                              (continuing)
                         Look, man! That's the pitcher of my 
                         little girl that died. Her name was 
                         Carrie.
                              (Swede is around, 
                              reluctant, scared, 
                              uninterested. As his 
                              eyes lift toward the 
                              picture, SWING CAMERA 
                              to lose him, and 
                              past Scully, and to 
                              new picture as Scully 
                              continues)
                         And then here's the pitcher of my

                              turns his head back 
                              to CAMERA to look.)

               MEDIUM SHOT -- SCULLY

               He drops to knees, plants his lamp on the carpet, and burrows 
               under the bed.

                                     SCULLY'S VOICE
                              (muffled)

                         Then there's the old woman -- Where 
                         is it now?

               CLOSE SHOT -- SCULLY'S HIGH RUMP AND THE LAMP

                                     SCULLY'S VOICE
                              (from under bed)
                         I never put it twice in the same 
                         place. Ah, now, come out with ye.

               Scrambling and grunting he backs from under the bed dragging 
               an old coat rolled into a bundle, flecked with lint.

                                     SCULLY
                         I've fetched him!

               He starts brushing off flecks of lint.

               MEDIUM CLOSE -- SWEDE -- FROM JUST OFF ANGLE OF LAMP

               The Swede, his eye sharpening.

               Scully brushes off a last little whisk of lint and carefully 
               unrolls the coat, and extracts from its heart a large yellow-
               brown whiskey bottle. He holds the bottle against the 
               lamplight. Reassured that nobody has been at it, he thrusts 
               it upward with a generous movement toward the Swede.

               MEDIUM SHOT -- SWEDE -- PAST SCULLY

               He is about to eagerly clutch this element of strength but 
               suddenly jerks his hand away and casts a look of horror upon 
               Scully.

               Scully gets to his feet, lamp in one hand, bottle in the 
               other, and takes a step toward the Swede.

                                     SCULLY
                              (affectionately)
                         Drink.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- SCULLY AND SWEDE

               Lighted only by the lamp. A silence. Scully clamps the bottle 
               under the lamp-bearing arm, twists out the cork, holds out 
               both bottle and cork.

                                     SCULLY
                         Drink!

               Suddenly the Swede laughs wildly. He grabs the bottle, screws 
               it into his mouth.

               CLOSE SHOT -- SCULLY -- PAST SWEDE

               Small, worried, the beginning even of a look of fright.

               CLOSE SHOT -- SWEDE

               In witch-like lamplight: bottle tilted high, lips curling 
               around the opening, throat working and SOUNDS of his 
               swallowing: his eyes, burning with hatred, fixed upon Scully.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               A long astounded silence. The Easterner lights a cigarette.

                              (almost reverently)
                         That's the dod-dangdest Swede I ever 
                         see!

                              (contemptuously)
                         He ain't no Swede.

                                     JOHNNIE
                         Well what is he then? What is he 
                         then?

                                     COWBOY
                              (astutely and 
                              deliberately)
                         It's my opinion he's some kind of a 
                         Dutchman.

               Johnnie is impressed; the Easterner, interested and amused 
               by both of them, covers his amusement.

                                     COWBOY
                              (continuing)
                         Yes, sir, it's my opinion this feller 
                         is some kind of a Dutchman.

                                     JOHNNIE
                              (sulkily)
                         Well he says he's a Swede anyhow.
                              (to Easterner)
                         What do you think?

                                     EASTERNER
                         Oh, I don't know.

                                     COWBOY
                         Well, what do you think makes him 
                         act like that?

                                     EASTERNER
                         Why, he's frightened.
                              (he flicks ash in 
                              spittoon)

               CAMERA slowly creeps them into close up.

                                     EASTERNER
                              (continuing)
                         He's clear frightened out of his 
                         boots.

                                     JOHNNIE AND COWBOY
                              (in unison)
                         What at?

               The Easterner reflects.

                                     JOHNNIE AND COWBOY
                              (again in unison)
                         What at?

                                     EASTERNER
                              (slowly turning the 
                              cigarette between 
                              his fingertips, 
                              scrutinising the 
                              coal)
                         Oh, I don't know, but it seems to me 
                         this man has been reading dime novels 
                         about the wild west, and he thinks 
                         he's right out in the middle of it -- 
                         the shootin' and stabbin' and all.
                              (he looks to the Cowboy 
                              and then to Johnnie)

               CLOSER SHOT -- COWBOY -- FROM ANGLE OF JOHNNIE'S RIGHT 
               SHOULDER, EASTERNER'S BACK, IN L.S.

                                     COWBOY
                              (deeply scandalized)
                         But this ain't Wyoming, ner none o' 
                         them places. This is Nebrasky.

               CLOSER SHOT -- JOHNNIE -- FROM ANGLE OF COWBOY'S LEFT 
               SHOULDER, EASTERNER'S BACK, IN R.S.

                                     JOHNNIE
                              (sore and eager)
                         Yeah, an' why don't he wait till he 
                         gits out West?

               CLOSE SHOT -- EASTERNER -- FROM ANGLE OF SWEDE'S CHAIR

                                     EASTERNER
                              (laughs quietly)
                         It isn't so wild out there even -- 
                         not in these days. But he thinks 
                         he's right in the middle of hell.

               He is quiet. Johnnie and the Cowboy muse long.

                                     JOHNNIE
                              (after a silence)
                         It's awful funny.

                                     COWBOY
                         Yeah, this is a queer game. I hope 
                         we don't git snowed in...
                              (Easterner glances 
                              toward front window)
                         ...'cause then we'd have to stand 
                         this here man around with us all the 
                         time. That wouldn't be no good.
                              (he wags his head)
                         No sir ree bob tail.

                                     JOHNNIE
                         I wish Pop ud throw him out.

                                     COWBOY
                         Couldn't do that. He ain't done 
                         nuthin'. Not edsackly.

                                     JOHNNIE
                         I don't care. I don't like him.

                                     COWBOY
                         You or me neither.

               They are alerted by SOUND of loud stomping on the stairs, 
               o.s. Scully's ringing voice ad lib, no words audible; the 
               Swede's laughter. They all look quickly to the stairway door, 
               then "vacantly" at each other.

                                     COWBOY
                         Gosh!

               SOUND of door opening o.s.; all look sharply toward it.

               LONG SHOT -- SAME POSITION -- UP ROOM TO DOOR

               Scully, flushed and anecdotal, swings into the room and down 
               toward the table like all three musketeers. The Swede follows, 
               laughing bravely.

                                     SCULLY
                              (more or less over 
                              his shoulder)
                         An' then he sez, sez, 'Oh', he sez, 
                         'I've got to bring thim along to 
                         hould the jackass,' he sez: 'He don't 
                         like it.'
                              (plenty of haw haw 
                              from Swede and Scully)
                         'He don't like it', he sez! Wouldn't 
                         that kill yez?

                                     SWEDE
                         He don't like it, huh? Haw, haw,! 
                         Durn good!

               Scully is almost up to the stove, Swede close behind; CAMERA 
               PULLS BACK to shoot past them at the seated men during 
               Scully's next line.

                                     SCULLY
                              (sharply)
                         Come now, move up and give us a chance 
                         at the stove.

               The Cowboy and the Easterner obediently sidle their chairs 
               to make room. Johnnie, keeping the board on his lap, simply 
               arranges himself in a more indolent attitude.

                                     SCULLY
                         Come, git over there.

                                     JOHNNIE
                         Plenty of room without me movin'.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- SCULLY -- FROM JOHNNIE'S ANGLE SWEDE IN 
               BACKGROUND

                                     SCULLY
                              (roaring)
                         An' you with the warmest spot in the 
                         house?

                                     SWEDE
                              (a patronising bully)
                         No, no. Let the boy sit where he 
                         likes.

                                     SCULLY
                              (deferentially)
                         All right! All right!

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- COWBOY AND EASTERNER

               They exchange glances of wonder.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- ACROSS GROUP BETWEEN EASTERNER AND 
               JOHNNIE

                                     SWEDE
                         Anyhow, I don't know as I want to 
                         sit with these people.

                                     SCULLY
                         Just suit yourself Mister. We'd be 
                         glad of yer company, but just suit 
                         yourself. Liberty Hall, ye know.
                              (he laughs nervously)

                                     SWEDE
                         I want a drink of water.

                                     SCULLY
                              (at once)
                         I'll git it for you.

                                     SWEDE
                              (contemptuously)
                         Nahh, I'll get it for myself.

               He walks off with the air of an owner toward and into Scully's 
               office. CAMERA LIFTING TO FOLLOW, shooting past tops of the 
               heads of the seated men. As soon as he is out of sight Scully 
               and CAMERA lean down quick and close into the group.

                                     SCULLY
                              (in an intense whisper)
                         Ye know what? Upstairs? I gave him a 
                         little snort o' what's good for yez, 
                         an' he thought I was tryin' to poison 
                         'im!

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- ON JOHNNIE AND SCULLY -- PAST THE 
               EASTERNER AND COWBOY

                                     JOHNNIE
                              (not lowering his 
                              voice)
                         Say, this makes me sick, why...

                                     SCULLY
                              (finger to lips)
                         Ssh!

                                     JOHNNIE
                              (voice scarcely lowered)
                         ...why don't you throw 'im out in 
                         the snow?

                                     SCULLY
                         Why, he's all right now. It was only 
                         that he was from the East, and he 
                         thought this was a tough place...

               CLOSE SHOT -- COWBOY

               Looking with admiration toward the Easterner

                                     SCULLY'S VOICE
                              (o.s.)
                         ...That's all. He's all right now.

               As the Cowboy speaks, the CAMERA SWINGS to include the 
               Easterner.

                                     COWBOY
                         You were straight. You were onto 
                         that there Dutchman, dead to rights.

               CLOSE SHOT -- JOHNNIE -- FROM COWBOY'S ANGLE

                                     JOHNNIE
                         Well, he may be all right now, but I 
                         don't see it. Other time he was 
                         scared, but now he's too fresh. Ain't 
                         that right?

                                     COWBOY'S VOICE
                              (o.s.)
                         Sure looks like it to me.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- COWBOY AND EASTERNER -- PAST JOHNNIE

                                     COWBOY
                         Looks like to me he's bound to fall 
                         off one side a th' hoss or t'other.

               The Easterner nods quietly.

                                     JOHNNIE'S VOICE
                              (o.s.)
                         Why don't you kick him out, Pop?

               A sharp INTAKE OF BREATH from Scully; all look up sharply.

               CLOSE SHOT -- SCULLY

               PULLING BACK with him as he leans down into group, hands on 
               knees, thundering at him with passionate solemnity.

                                     SCULLY
                         What do I keep? What do I keep? What 
                         do I keep?
                              (he slaps one knee 
                              impressively; shouts)
                         I keep a hotel! A hotel, do ye mind? 
                         A guest under my roof has sacred

                         by none. Not one word shall he hear 
                         that would prijiduce him in favor of

                         no place in this here town where

                         Yes, Mr. Scully, I think you're right.

                                     SCULLY
                              (to Easterner)

                         Yes, Mr. Scully, I think you're right.

               CAMERA tilts upward a little, shooting across the group, 
               still HOLDING them in the bottom of the shot; after a second 
               the Swede re-enters from the office and walks toward them, 
               his footsteps heavy, his eyes on them. None of them look up 
               or around at him.

               The SOUND of an opening door, o.s.; Scully's eyes toward it.

               MEDIUM SHOT -- SAME POSITION BUT NEW ANGLE -- DINING ROOM 
               DOOR

               Past the stove on the dining room door; Scully's daughter is 
               leaning through it.

                              breath)
                         Supper, gintlemen.
                              (he gestures them up)

               They are all up and filing toward the door; still no eye for 
               the Swede who is walking alone toward them.

                                                                QUICK FADE:

               FADE IN:

               CLOSE SHOT -- DINING ROOM -- THE SWEDE

               His head is against an almost halation-brassy highlight, 
               through glass, on a broad perforated mechanical-music disc 
               and, when we PULL BACK, a mechanical violin or mandolin: 
               stentorian NOISE of the nervous plucking of the perforations 
               and the exact driven rasping screech of the violin (playing 
               some potpourri of Waldteufel waltzes or of early honky-tonk 
               ragtime): also a NOISE of cranking and of tightening springs. 
               The Swede's stooped round shining malignantly grinning face 
               is on level of disc and much like it. His napkin on, his 
               hair wetted and combed slick but beginning to spike up awry; 
               he laughs low, finishes his cranking and listens a moment 
               with burlesque of connoisseur's or Old Maestro's relish, 
               imitates a would-be-lyrical phrase of the violin with the 
               skreeky humming of a bass humming falsetto and with mock-
               affected hands mocking those of a violinist and with a look 
               of mock ecstasy; then smacks his hands together loudly and 
               does a peasant dance step on his way back to his chair, which 
               is almost directly in front of the machine so that the turning 
               disc backs Swede's head throughout this scene like a phony 
               halo. He scrapes back his chair as loudly as he can; sits 
               down, and looks triumphantly and cruelly and with an air of 
               great benefaction from man to man, while he shovels down the 
               food in the manner of Henry VIII.

               QUICK FLICKING SHOTS, AS FROM THE SWEDE'S EYES: SEATING SAME 
               AS AT DINNER

               THE EASTERNER

               Looking even smaller than he is, eating rather little; encased 
               in reserve.

               THE COWBOY

               Staring across at the Swede in wide-mouthed amazement, 
               forgetting to eat.

               SCULLY

               His own version of the Easterner, shoulders huddled, eyes to 
               plate, trying to pretend to eat as if nothing were happening.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- SWEDE AND JOHNNIE -- PAST EASTERNER AND 
               COWBOY

               The Swede is leering happily sidelong at Johnnie, who is 
               eating quickly and savagely. PULL AROUND to lose Johnnie and 
               CREEP INTO FULL CLOSE UP on the Swede, losing the Cowboy and 
               the Easterner.

               The Swede munches and finishes a huge mouthful, drinks from 
               his tumbler with parodistic extension of thick pinkie, swabs 
               his mouth royally with the apron of the napkin which is tied 
               under his ears; flicks glances from eye to eye.

                                     SWEDE
                              (with brutally mock 
                              incredulity)
                         You gentlemen don't like a little 
                         dinner music?

               FLICK SHOT OF EASTERNER AND COWBOY FROM SWEDE'S ANGLE

               They are even more-so what they were, than before.

               FLICK ON SCULLY -- FROM SWEDE'S ANGLE

               He primly and delicately sips from his glass, looking a little 
               like a hurt old lady.

               CLOSE ON SWEDE

                                     SWEDE

                         making a foe pah, like the feller 
                         says?

                              (not looking up; 
                              mumbling)
                         O, yes, yes. It's a custom. Music or 
                         not, it's all the same.

                         they wouldn't call it a nice place 
                         to eat without they have a feller

                         palm trees on a little platform,

                         eat.

                         right, Mr. Scully?

               Scully half nods, not speaking or looking; trying to pretend 
               to eat.

                                     SWEDE
                              (continuing)

                              with his eating elbow;

                              hard; Swede roars 
                              with laughter.)

               INSERT

               Vertical over biscuit plate as the Easterner's small, reaching 
               hand is all but impaled by the Swede's fork, reaching for a 
               biscuit.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- EASTERNER -- QUICK SHOT FROM SWEDE'S 
               ANGLE Easterner's reaction, which is to cover up as quick as 
               possible.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- SWEDE

               He glints expectantly toward the Easterner, bursts into loud 
               laughter at his reaction, which he translates as cowardice.

               Up through the SOUND of his hard loud laughter and the hard 
               loud music, comes an enigmatic racket; the chuffing, growling 
               roar, the banshee wail of wind in the chimney. The Swede's 
               laugh bites off like a hatchet through a hen's neck: he is 
               transfixed by the profound fright which unexpected noises 
               cause in some men.

                                     SWEDE
                              (to Scully)
                         What's that?

               No answer. The ROAR continues. The Swede's fear increases.

               MEDIUM SHOT -- DOWN THE TABLE PAST SCULLY

               Three grateful, happy faces, nobody eating, eyes all lifted 
               to study Swede.

               CAMERA PULLS BACK a little, equalizing the Swede and Scully

                         the wind. Just the angle of the wind 
                         in the chimney.

               They all resume eating; little glances to the Swede and each 
               other; plenty pleased.

               CLOSE SHOT -- SWEDE

               He listens a moment; the SOUND begins slowly to diminish.

                                     SWEDE

                              (he looks around; 
                              silence)
                         Who says so?
                              (looks around again)

               CAMERA begins to PULL BACK on his bullying glance to their 
               silence.

                                     SWEDE
                              (continuing; low hard 
                              giggle begins)

                              (giggle)
                         Me?

               CAMERA arrests pull-out; Swede is centered, Scully and Johnnie 
               and the Cowboy's shoulder flanking. The giggle breaks into 
               full malicious laughter.

                                     SWEDE

                              to Johnnie)
                         Butter please.

               Johnnie acts as if he didn't even hear.

                              of butter, while 
                              Scully winces, and 
                              loads it onto a split 
                              biscuit. In a 
                              friendly, chatty 
                              manner, to Scully)
                         That's what I like about the hotel 
                         you keep Mister Scully.
                              (chomp, chomp)
                         It ain't got no class but they ain't 
                         nobody can say you're stingy with 
                         the vittles: hah?

               On "hah?", a mouthful of buttery biscuit wide open in mock-
               friendliness; some of it falls out almost on Scully's plate. 
               Swede, in mock embarassment, picks it up as prissily as if 
               it stank and puts it on the edge of his own plate.

               Scully's daughter enters to clear plates.

                         this pie is occypewed, allow me to 
                         sew you to another sheet, a-har-har-

                         How do you like that! This pie is 
                         occypewed. Huh? Oh marrdon me paddum.

                              honeyed)

                         that ain't a question a gentleman 
                         would ask, is it? Is it Mister Scully?
                              (silence)
                         But it's a fair bet she's older than 
                         Johnnieboy, huh Johnnie? Could pretty 
                         near be Johnnie's mother, huh?

               She is coming behind him with dessert and now tries to serve 
               him; again he forces her to lean, twisting and looking up at 
               her with broad mock-admiration; at the moment her face leans 
               lowest he winks into her face enormously and clicks his gums; 
               she shrivels, shoveling his saucer onto the table, and hurries 
               away. Scully is damn near ready to take action but the Swede 
               breaks through a comfortable giggle in a voice of deep and 
               kind concern, genuine-seeming enough to counter Scully.

                         Poor girl. I must of said something 
                         that hurt her feelings. You tell her 
                         how sorry I am Mister Scully if I 
                         don't get a chance to tell her myself, 
                         will you?
                              (no answer)
                         Please sir. They ain't nothing a 
                         gentleman feels so ashamed of as if 
                         he hurts a lady's feelings. Yes, I 
                         tell you, Mister Scully, you're a 
                         mighty lucky man, you got a fine 
                         girl will stay with you she likes 
                         her old Dad so much, when plenty 
                         would just get married and clear 
                         outa this town quick as they got the 
                         chance. Cuts down the overhead, you 
                         don't have to hire no help. Maybe 
                         she gives you her tips, hah? Besides, 
                         you run a hotel that ain't so much 
                         fer class, it makes up fer a lot if 
                         you see a pretty girl around the 
                         place. Hah? Little services she can 
                         do the guests, don't ya know, that 
                         need the woman's touch? Yes, sir, my 
                         opinion is, you're a mighty lucky 
                         man.
                              (but instead of quite 
                              getting out "man" 
                              clearly, he nurses 
                              and relishes along 
                              and delivers a slow 
                              tremendous growling 
                              belch)
                         Now where I come from, a feller that 
                         done that, they'd say it was somethin' 
                         so awful it ain't any use to make 
                         excuses. They'd just say, go on out 
                         an' eat with the pigs. That's in 
                         Europe. But heere: In Americah: Course 
                         in China they tell me, why if you 
                         don't give a nice big belch why your 
                         host his feelings get hurt cause you 
                         ain't got no manners. You give a 
                         belch to prove you like the eats. 
                         Like that. See? But then you ain't 
                         no Chinaman, are you Mister Scully.
                              (the low steady giggle 
                              and the look around)
                         No sir, it takes all kinds.

               He looks around for something else to say; picking his teeth 
               and talking through it.

                         Funny thing, you fellers don't eat 
                         enough. Look hearty, except a course 
                         our little friend from Philadelphia, 
                         but you don't eat enough. Except 
                         Johnnieboy here. He'll eat you outa 
                         house and home, hah Johnnie? But 
                         Johnnie needs it. Gonna make a man 
                         of him someday hah Johnnieboy?
                              (giggle)
                         If he can eat enough.
                              (giggle)
                         Now me: one thing I can say for 
                         myself, ain't nothing ever hurts my 
                         appetite. I betcha I could eat hearty 
                         off my dead mother's coffin.
                              (the look around)
                         Take tonight. Nobody talking hardly 
                         but me. Nobody but me trying to be 
                         sociable and keep the ball rolling. 
                         Lotsa people that'd put um off their 
                         feed like it done you fellers, but 
                         not me. Like you see it in the papers, 
                         the condemned man ate a hearty 
                         breakfast. Supper I mean.
                              (pleasant laugh)
                         All it takes now to make it perfect 
                         is another little glass of schnapps, 
                         uhh? Settle our chow? Put the stummick 
                         juices to work? Hehnh?

               CAMERA PULLS BACK to bring Scully into TWO SHOT

                              (almost inaudible 
                              muttering)
                         No... think not... moderation... 
                         save it for medicinal purposes...

                         Oohh, Miss-ter Scully!

               Scully pulls back his chair and gets up, CAMERA PULLING BACK 
               to include whole group and table as all pull back and rise 
               with relief. The Swede gets up too; as Scully passes he gives 
               him a hell of a whack across the shoulders and steps along 
               with him.

                                     SWEDE
                         Well, anyhow old boy, that was a 
                         good square meal.

               CLOSE SHOT -- SCULLY

               It looks for a moment as though he might flame out over the 
               matter.

               MEDIUM CLOSE -- THE GROUP -- PAST SCULLY

               On their hopeful, expectant eyes.

               Scully breaks down into a sickly smile and remains silent. 
               It is clear from his manner that he is admitting his 
               responsibility for the Swede's new viewpoint.

               The Swede towers past Scully and past CAMERA toward the door; 
               Scully follows, CAMERA SWINGING with him. As he passes 
               Johnnie, Johnnie plucks at his sleeve and whispers something 
               to him.

                                     SCULLY
                              (in undertone)
                         Why don't you license somebody to 
                         kick you downstairs?

               They go along toward and through the door, CAMERA following. 
               CAMERA PICKS UP the Easterner and the Cowboy as they come 
               along the end of the table toward the door.

                         When he thought Scully was trying to 
                         poison him.

                         Mister!

               They go through the door into the main room.

               MEDIUM SHOT -- MAIN ROOM

               CAMERA on dining room door, already swinging, catching them 
               as they file in, stiff and silent with antagonism; swing 
               with them as they pass on the far side of the stove to the 
               crescent of empty chairs; the Swede strides immediately to 
               the best chair, (nearest CAMERA) hand proprietorily on its 
               back; not yet sitting; he wheels on the others as they 
               straggle into the shot. They are all very tense and still 
               with lounging hostility, intensely silent except when 
               speaking. The Swede just keeps looking at them until they 
               are all there, all still standing; as if he were a Chairman, 
               waiting for members of a meeting to assemble.

                         Oh, I don't think that's such a very 
                         good idea perhaps...

                         decide...

                              (hard and taciturn)
                         Suits me Mister.

                                     SWEDE
                         Looks like you're out voted Mister 
                         Scully so where's them cards?

                                     SCULLY
                              (still trying to be 
                              pleasant)
                         Well now that's friendly of you but 
                         if you gentlemen don't mind I think 
                         I'll just look at me paper; here it 
                         is night already and all day I 
                         haven't...

                                     SWEDE
                              (interrupting; to 
                              Johnnie)
                         So?

               For a moment their glances cross like blades. Then Johnnie 
               smiles.

                                     JOHNNIE
                         Yes; I'll play.

               CAMERA PULLS BACK to include the whole group as he starts 
               for the table. The Swede nods curtly. The Easterner and the 
               Cowboy swap quiet glances. Scully looks uneasy enough almost 
               to intervene; then purses his lips, shrugs faintly, and drifts 
               out of the group and across shot nearer.

               CAMERA SWINGS AND HOLDS on him, back-to, turning up the lamp 
               on the side table for reading.

               CLOSE SHOT -- JOHNNIE'S HANDS

               The purring shuffle, swiftly, twice, PULLING OUT AND UP on 
               second shuffle to take Johnnie, back to stove as before, and 
               Swede at his left -- i.e. in r.s.

               CLOSE UP -- COWBOY -- SCULLY IN DEEP B.G. AT WINDOW

                                     SCULLY
                              (turning from window)
                         It's quit snowin' gintlemen.

                                     COWBOY
                         Yeah?

                                     SCULLY
                              (back toward reading 
                              table)
                         But a worse wind than ever. Bitter 
                         night.
                              (No comment from anyone)

               CLOSE UP -- EASTERNER

               Arranging his cards. He is absorbed in the tensions rather 
               than the game.

               CLOSE UP -- JOHNNIE

               He is the only one of them well inside the cards. We see 
               also his extreme hatred for the Swede, quietly and rather 
               gracefully borne.

                                     JOHNNIE
                              (to Swede, after a 
                              silence)
                         Well, it's your bid.

               CLOSE UP -- THE SWEDE

               His eyes, in a jagged flickering, down to the cards close to 
               his chest, then toward each face in turn.

                                     SWEDE
                         Don't hurry me, boy.
                              (a pause)

               He bids rather high: in this game trumps are named only after 
               bidding is finished.

               HOLD CAMERA on the Swede as the Cowboy raises, Easterner 
               passes and Johnnie passes.

                                     SWEDE
                              (to Easterner)
                         Couldn't help me out, Huh?

               No answer.

                                     SWEDE
                         I pass.

               He throws out his discards and picks up his new cards; looks 
               to the Cowboy, expecting, as we do, the usual WHAM.

               Move CAMERA into the CIRCULAR SHOT; on the Cowboy as he lays 
               down his card, quite gently for him; on the Easterner's mildly 
               surprised reaction as he plays; on Johnnie playing, his face 
               very quiet and hating; on the Swede as, vindictively, with 
               scarcely any amusement about it, he WHAMS harder than the 
               Cowboy did all afternoon. His hand moves to rake in the trick.

                                     COWBOY'S VOICE
                              (o.s.)
                         That's my trick.

                                     SWEDE
                              (a dead voice)
                         So? I played the ace.

                                     COWBOY'S VOICE
                              (o.s.)
                         That ain't the trump suit.

                                     SWEDE
                              (his hand still on 
                              the trick)
                         So?

                                     JOHNNIE'S VOICE
                              (o.s.)
                         Yeah, so.

                                     SWEDE
                         It's yours.
                              (he shrugs and tosses 
                              trick to center of 
                              table)

               CAMERA turns on them again, a little more quickly as each 
               plays, picking up their smoldering reactions to the Swede's 
               perversity; on the Swede's play he WHAMS again, even harder 
               than before. Again he starts to rake in the trick.

                                     EASTERNER'S VOICE
                              (o.s.)
                         That's Johnnie's trick.

                                     SWEDE
                         So? What's trumps?

                                     COWBOY'S VOICE
                              (o.s.)
                         Clubs, and besides you didn't only 
                         play a trey.

                                     SWEDE
                         My left Pedro.

                                     COWBOY
                         Five o' spades yer left Pedro.

                                     SWEDE
                         Oh, five; oh yaah. Five.
                              (shrugs)
                         Okay; it's yours.
                              (he tosses the trick 
                              toward Johnnie)
                         It's only in fun.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- THE THREE FROM SWEDE'S ANGLE

               Just looking at him.

                                     SWEDE'S VOICE
                              (o.s.)
                         Your play.

               Cowboy wonders for a moment whether to go on; then he plays 
               a card quietly.

               CLOSE SHOT -- THE SWEDE

               Watchful and somber. SOUND of Easterner's and Johnnie's 
               playing.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- SCULLY

               In his chair, flinching at the SOUND of the Swede's WHAM 
               o.s. Continue card sounds and low voices ad lib o.s. as Scully 
               loads his pipe; lights it; unfurls and arranges his newspaper 
               for reading as the CAMERA creeps very slowly toward him into 
               CLOSE UP; starts reading. Card SOUNDS fade and wind SOUND is 
               brought up a little. Easterner's voice comes as vague as if 
               through ether.

                                     EASTERNER'S VOICE
                              (o.s.)
                         If you'd held onto that Jack we could 
                         have busted them you know.

                                     SWEDE'S VOICE
                              (o.s.)
                         Just play your own hand Mister. I'll 
                         take care of mine.

               SOUND of shuffling o.s., then of dealing; the card SOUNDS 
               FADE OUT completely and the wind fades to a dreaming whine 
               as we slowly FADE on Scully, deeply absorbed in his reading, 
               his lips moving a little.

               FADE IN:

               Just a little soft in focus, faint card SOUNDS, the wind up 
               a little; Scully is dozing; a wind-whicker wakes him with a 
               jerk with which we jerk to pure focus. He glances up at the 
               clock on the wall to his left; it is eight-twenty-seven and 
               for those who noticed it before the fade, was then seven-
               fourteen: Scully registers an aging man's surprise and mild 
               embarrassment at old-age dozing. He clearly reproves himself 
               and determines to wake up thoroughly and stay awake till a 
               fit hour. He brushes spilled ash and tobacco crumbs from his 
               lapel, polishes his glasses, readjusts them on his nose, 
               resets himself to read; realizes the lamp is smoking a little; 
               gets up fussily and adjusts it properly; business with paper 
               again and really settles down to read, with that peering 
               look of an old priest; lips moving, half-whispering what he 
               is reading; a great rumpling turn of the paper, resettles 
               again, peacefully reading fillers and mumbling to himself.

               CAMERA CLOSE

                                     SCULLY
                              (a whispering mumble)
                         "Lake Titicaca in Peru is the highest 
                         body of fresh water in the world,

                         have never yet been plumbed." Niver 
                         yet been plumbed. Fascinatin'. Now 
                         isn't that fascinatin'!

                         B.C.)". Think o' that!
                              (he clucks his tongue)
                         Sturdy saplings were they! My!

                                     SWEDE
                              (o.s.; in a terrible 
                              voice)
                         You are cheatin'!

               Catch just the beginning of Scully's reaction then

                                                              QUICK CUT TO:

               LONG SHOT

               The CAMERA is well toward the front of the room, height of 
               the eyes of the seated men; Scully MEDIUM in r.s., players 
               LONG, down center-to-left.

               Scully is half out of his chair at the start of the shot; he 
               stands up fast, his paper floating, forgotten, to his feet, 
               making the only SOUND in the room. His spectacles fall from 
               his nose as he gets up but, by a clutch, he saves them in 
               mid-air; the hand grasping them is poised awkwardly near his 
               shoulder. From the moment he is on his feet, a solid two 
               seconds of frozen tableau: the Swede half crouching out of 
               his chair, a huge fist, (not shaking) in Johnnie's face; 
               Johnnie still seated, looking steadily into the blazing orbs 
               of his accuser. The Easterner, gripping the arms of his chair, 
               sits very still and is very pale.

               After this 2-second paralysis, everybody moves as suddenly 
               and simultaneously as if set off by a starter's gun. Johnnie, 
               rising to hurl himself on the Swede, stumbles slightly because 
               of his curiously instinctive care for the cards and table. 
               The loss of this moment allows time for the arrival of Scully 
               (an old man sprinting) and also allows Cowboy time to give 
               the Swede a shove which sends him staggering back. They all 
               find tongue together (ad lib variants and fragments of lines 
               below) and hoarse shouts of rage, appeal or fear, burst from 
               every throat. The Cowboy pushes and jostles feverishly at 
               Swede; Easterner and Scully cling wildly to Johnnie; but 
               through the smoky air, above the swaying bodies of the peace-
               compellers, the eyes of the two warriors meet each other in 
               glances of challenge which are at once hot and steely.

               At the same instant everybody moves, the CAMERA ZOOMS TO 
               CLOSE UP at average shoulder height, arriving just in time 
               to catch them standing up and straining.

               CLOSE SHOT -- JOHNNIE

               Struggling against restraint INTO CLOSE UP

               CLOSE SHOT -- SWEDE AND COWBOY

               Voices are simultaneous.

                                     EASTERNER
                              (o.s.)

               CLOSE THREE SHOT -- EASTERNER, SCULLY, JOHNNIE

               Voices are again simultaneous.

               In a lower tone, o.s., the Cowboy and Swede repeat their 
               lines.

               CENTER CAMERA ON JOHNNIE and advance slowly on him into CLOSE 
               UP SHOT as he continues

                                     JOHNNIE
                              (continuing)
                         ...he says I cheated! I won't allow 
                         no man to say I cheated! If he says 
                         I cheated he's a...

               His lips form whatever most extreme suggestion of obscene or 
               profane insult can be permitted by inference, covered and 
               silenced by the Swede's still louder bellowing.

                                     SWEDE
                              (o.s.)
                         He did cheat! I saw him!

               CLOSE SHOT -- SWEDE -- FULL FACE

                                     SWEDE
                         I saw him! He did! He did!

               CAMERA, starting with a shot past the Swede's head, centering 
               on Johnnie MEDIUM CLOSE, makes, fairly fast and accelerating, 
               steadily tighter and faster and closer, the circling movement 
               by which a tethered heifer winds herself up short around a 
               post. The players meanwhile are all simultaneously repeating 
               their lines as heretofore with only very close ad lib 
               variations: out of the din of their voices only key words 
               ring out sharply. The weave of salients is roughly:

               Stop n...

               Wait a mom...

               Quit now...

               He says...

               He did!...

               What's the good...

               Fight...

               As the CAMERA thus ropes them in they all close tighter and 
               tighter against one center as if it were literally a rope 
               around them: they come as close as five people can get. The 
               ROUNDING CAMERA, at shoulder height, SWINGS through an extreme 
               CLOSE UP of the Swede past Johnnie's head and then of Johnnie 
               past the Swede's head practically as if they were waltzing, 
               and comes to a stop, very close in, profiling Johnnie's 
               glaring head at l.s and the Swede's in r.s. Now there are no 
               words; only the SOUND of excited breathing, then not even 
               that: a sudden great cessation. It is as if each man has 
               paused for breath.

               CAMERA PULLS BACK INTO MEDIUM CLOSE -- THE WHOLE GROUP as 
               hands relax and there is a cautious unstiffening away from 
               center; even the Swede and Johnnie step back a little way. 
               Then Johnnie steps forward, fairly close in to the Swede and 
               the CAMERA moves in about a foot.

                                     JOHNNIE
                              (less loudly)
                         What did you say I cheated for? What 
                         did you say I cheated for? I don't 
                         cheat and I won't let no man say I 
                         do.

                                     SWEDE
                         I saw you! I saw you!

               CAMERA CREEPS very slowly in: Its motion is that of a very 
               slowly winding snake. CAMERA CENTERS ON JOHNNIE

                                     JOHNNIE
                         Well, I'll fight any man what says I 
                         cheat!

               CAMERA SLOWLY DOLLYING CENTERS COWBOY

                                     COWBOY
                         No you won't. Not here.

                                     SCULLY
                         Ah be still can't you?

               CAMERA CENTERS SCULLY AS HE STEPS between Johnnie and Swede

                                     EASTERNER'S VOICE
                              (o.s.; he walks back 
                              into shot)
                         Oh, wait a moment can't you? What's 
                         the good of a fight over a game of 
                         cards? Wait a moment.

               A short pause: the eyes of all five are visible. Already the 
               momentum toward war is in them and is already all but 
               irresistible.

               Now a series of quick shots, closer in:

               SCULLY -- HIS EYES TO COWBOY

               (His main meaning: How're the chances?)

               COWBOY -- HIS EYES TO JOHNNIE

               (His look means: Boy, will he back down on a man that accuses 
               him of cheating?)

               JOHNNIE -- HIS EYES TO SWEDE

               (His look means: You lying son of a bitch, take that back or 
               fight.)

               SWEDE -- LOOKING STRAIGHT BACK AT JOHNNIE

               (His look means: You know damn well you cheated).

               SCULLY -- HIS EYES TO JOHNNIE

               (His look means: How about it, son?)

               EASTERNER -- HIS EYES AT JOHNNIE

               (His look means: For God's sake let's not have a fight.)

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- JOHNNIE

               The others flanking: quick, steady glances at Scully, Cowboy, 
               Easterner. From each face we can see from Johnnie's face 
               that he gets fuller and fuller confirmation toward fighting.

               Johnnie steps from behind Scully and walks slowly forward. 
               He looks very quiet and brave.

                                     JOHNNIE
                              (quietly)
                         Did you say I cheated?

               MEDIUM CLOSE QUICK SHOT -- EYES OF SCULLY, EASTERNER AND 
               COWBOY TO THE SWEDE

               Intense silence.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- JOHNNIE

               Very gallant and graceful, waiting.

               SWING CAMERA SLOWLY to lose Johnnie and bring in Swede who 
               is standing still.

               A short silence. The Swede looks like a liar sticking with 
               his lie. Even after he finally decides, he waits a moment: 
               when he speaks his monosyllable it is as if he finally jumped 
               off a high building.

                                     SWEDE
                              (showing his teeth)
                         Yes.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- THE GROUP

               Johnnie in l.s., the Swede in r.s. For a moment everyone is 
               very still.

                                     JOHNNIE
                              (very quietly)
                         Then we must fight.

                                     SWEDE
                              (instantly; roaring)
                         Yes, fight!

               CLOSE UP -- SWEDE

                                     SWEDE
                              (roaring like a demon)
                         Yes fight! I'll show you what kind 
                         of man I am!

               CAMERA PULLS AWAY slowly to include the three noncombatants.

                                     SWEDE
                              (continuing)
                         I'll show you who you want to fight! 
                         Maybe you think I can't fight! Maybe 
                         you think I can't! I'll show you, 
                         you skin, you card-sharp! Yes, you 
                         cheated! You cheated! You cheated!

               By the last sentence CAMERA also includes Johnnie, who stands 
               cool and quiet. A pause.

                                     JOHNNIE
                              (coolly)
                         Well, let's get at it, then, Mister.

               All five stand very still. Then Cowboy, catching Scully's 
               eye, beckons him aside with his chin. The others stay still 
               as they move apart toward the middle of the room.

               CLOSE SHOT -- PULLING SLOWLY BACK -- COWBOY

               He walks slowly, stooping next to Scully.

                                     COWBOY
                              (just above a whisper)
                         What ya goin' to do now?

               CAMERA SWINGS to include Scully, the Cowboy watching him 
               closely.

               CAMERA LOSES Cowboy by middle of Scully's lines, centering 
               on Scully.

                                     SCULLY
                              (stalwartly)
                         We'll let 'em fight. I can't put up 
                         with it any longer. I've stood this 
                         crazy Swede till I'm sick. We'll let 
                         them fight.

               He turns out of shot, toward the coats. In his place, MEDIUM 
               DISTANCE, we see the Easterner, his eyes on the Cowboy, very 
               closely. SWING AND PULL CAMERA so that the Cowboy is again 
               in CLOSE UP r.s., Easterner MEDIUM, watching him closely. In 
               the Cowboy's earnest face there is deep-country blood-lust. 
               He turns from the CAMERA toward the Easterner and the group 
               and walks through them toward the coatroom, not speaking. As 
               he walks and diminishes, the others come into view.

               The Easterner holds his eye until he is past. Johnnie, hands 
               hooked in his belt, is looking coolly, studyingly, at the 
               Swede. The Swede, hands open and heavy at his sides, shoulders 
               rounded, a little farther apart from the group than they are 
               from each other, is looking calmly, darkly and a little 
               solemnly, at Johnnie; in a sense he may suggest a chained 
               bear which is about to be baited. It is the Easterner who 
               has especially caught the Cowboy's eye and expression. His 
               reaction is that strange, wavering, uncontrollable smile 
               with which some people, to their astonishment and shame, 
               react to news of catastrophe. Just before the Cowboy gets 
               out of their range the other two glance toward him. Johnnie, 
               with a little smile, looks back into the Swede's eyes. The 
               Swede, looking sweaty, ungainly and bashful, looks at the 
               floor.

               The Cowboy walks on between them and toward the coat-corridor: 
               Johnnie is the first to follow him; then the Swede, with a 
               curious lethargic doggedness, looking almost sleepy; then 
               the Easterner, as shakily as if it were he who was going to 
               fight. In the b.g. Scully is already hunching into his coat.

               MOVING SHOT

               CAMERA PULLS BACKWARD through the coat-corridor (lighted by 
               lamp) past Scully, who is now buttoning up his coat. The 
               only SOUNDS are breathing, carefully controlled, and the 
               SOUNDS of clothes and feet. Johnnie comes up to Scully and 
               past him, for his coat; a silent exchange of glances, the 
               son calm, the father calm and proud: Johnnie slips into his 
               coat easily and gracefully. Only he and Scully are completely 
               calm. The Cowboy, with excited hot eyes is putting on his 
               fur cap with shaky hands. Johnnie meets the Swede's eyes 
               very coolly, almost humorously, as the Swede muscles through 
               for his coat. In this highly charged atmosphere all of the 
               men try their best not to touch each other, but the Swede, 
               in ungainliness, does touch Johnnie as he passes. A cold 
               little smile from Johnnie; Swede tightens his mouth.

               As we PULL BACK, and the Easterner works his way in, the 
               Cowboy catches his eye; the Easterner's glance quickly drops. 
               The Swede looks at nobody and nobody looks at the Swede except 
               when they are sure he will not see. The Easterner and the 
               Swede get to their coats at about the same time. The Easterner 
               is very nervous; he has trouble finding the sleeve of his 
               coat but he finally makes it. The Swede wraps a thick knitted 
               muffler high around his throat. He is very thick-fingered 
               buttoning his leather coat and, in spite of his efforts to 
               subdue it, we HEAR him begin to breathe heavily. The Easterner 
               watches his clumsiness; he clearly has a sudden impulse to 
               help and he clearly knows that he must not. The Swede puts 
               on his foolishly small cap and tries to pull the too-small 
               flaps down over his ears; the cap would obviously not stay 
               on in a fight; he takes it off, looks at it for a moment, 
               and hangs it back on a hook.

               Those who are already in their coats start drifting away 
               from the CAMERA into the main room and out of shot; the Swede 
               and the Easterner are alone at this last moment. Almost 
               timidly, the Easterner looks up into the Swede's eyes, 
               obviously thinking hard about something; perhaps even about 
               to speak. The Swede walks past without even seeming to see 
               him. The Easterner, with the helpless and fatal look of a 
               piece of foam snapping over the lip of a waterfall, follows 
               him.

               LONG SHOT -- MAIN ROOM -- FRONT DOOR IN DEEP R.S.

               The shot is made from the corner opposite the door, inward 
               end of the room, past the stove, including the side table 
               and lamp.

                                     SCULLY
                              (at the door, calling 
                              the stragglers who 
                              are already halfway 
                              up the room)
                         Well, come on.

               With their very differing gaits, they all hurry up a little.

               Scully opens the door. STORM NOISE. A terrific blast of wind 
               makes the lamp struggle at its wick, a puff of black smoke 
               springs from the chimneytop as the men hurry out; the stove 
               gets the cold wind next: its voice swells to equal the roar 
               of the storm and there is the frightening crackling and 
               hammering of hot metal too abruptly chilled; SWING CAMERA 
               DOWN as some of the scarred and bedabbled cards are caught 
               up from the floor and dashed helplessly against the end wall, 
               (some, including a face card or two, hang flat against the 
               wall a few inches from the floor) with SOUND of closing door, 
               these cards start to fall; before they reach the floor,

                                                              QUICK CUT TO:

               Outdoor violence as, with lowered heads, the men plunge into 
               the tempest as into a sea.

               MEDIUM SHOT -- PAST FRONT DOOR -- EXT. HOTEL (NITE)

               The CAMERA is medium close to the door, waist-high, shooting 
               past the door toward the station, as they stumble out. FULL 
               SOUND of a very strong wind, but more compelling than any 
               other noise, a pure electric or electronic SOUND, without 
               timbre, either so high it is just at the limit of audibility 
               or so high that it is just beyond that limit and works purely 
               on the nervous system (experiment will determine which is 
               better used in this context).

               There is no falling of snow; the wind is so strong it makes 
               them stagger and stumble; they all bow deep and turn their 
               backs to the wind as promptly as if they saw God; the wind 
               blows great whirls and clouds of flakes, streaming southward 
               with the speed of bullets. Though we have known from inside 
               that a strong wind is blowing, this exceeds all expectation: 
               a solid shrieking roar like flame, plus the supersonic scream, 
               which is on a high dead level.

               BOOM SHOT

               A little above head-height, leads their floundering along 
               the hotel faade toward the station, (leeward side of the 
               hotel). As they flounder into a thigh-deep drift we hear the 
               shapeless illegible bawling of the Swede,

                                     SWEDE
                              (rough approximation)
                         I haven't got a chance against you 
                         bastards.

               CAMERA DIPS a little toward them into a fairly CLOSE SHOT as 
               Scully waits, puts a hand on his shoulder, and projects an 
               ear.

                                     SCULLY
                              (shouting: it is just 
                              possible to hear him)
                         What's that you say?

                                     SWEDE
                              (bawling)
                         I say, I won't stand much show against 
                         this gang. I know you'll all pitch 
                         on me.

                                     SCULLY
                              (hits him reproachfully 
                              on the arm; yelling)
                         Tut, man!

               Violent wind.

                                     SWEDE
                              (booming)
                         You're all a gang of...

               Wind obliterates the word.

               They start again, CAMERA PULLS AHEAD of them all, facing 
               them; brings in the corner of the hotel and swings swiftly 
               into the lee of the building as the Cowboy and Johnnie turn 
               in. Immediate and striking diminution of NOISE: but SUPERSONIC 
               NOISE is not diminished. CAMERA with them, facing the wall, 
               they walk a few paces in and stand waiting, fairly close to 
               the wall, Johnnie looking toward the corner, the Cowboy toward 
               the CAMERA. There is a little light from one first-floor 
               window (coat corridor); its shade is drawn.

               MEDIUM SHOT -- DOWN PAST JOHNNIE AND COWBOY

               An irregular v-shape of heavily encrusted grass amid this 
               great devastation of snow. A long faint rectangle of light 
               from the window.

               SOUND of crackling of feet on grass o.s.; both heads turn 
               sharply.

               MEDIUM SHOT -- EASTERNER, SCULLY AND THE SWEDE

               They come around the corner. CAMERA at Cowboy's distance 
               from the corner but a few feet farther out from the wall.

                                     SWEDE
                              (still bellowing as 
                              they come up)
                         Oh I know what kind of a thing this 
                         is! I know you'll all pitch on me! I 
                         can't lick you all!

                                     SCULLY
                              (turning on him 
                              'panther fashion'.)
                         You'll not have to whip all of us. 
                         You'll have to whip my son Johnnie. 
                         An' the man what troubles you durin' 
                         that time will have me to dale with!

               SWING CAMERA to center on Cowboy, Easterner and Johnnie. The 
               latter is quiet, noncommittal; a spasm of contempt on the 
               Cowboy's face; the Easterner's teeth are chattering, he is 
               stomping his feet and is as jittery with cold as a jumping 
               jack.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- SWEDE

               His big head pivoting as he looks from one to another 
               sullenly, still suspicious. Scully takes him by the upper 
               arm and leads him cumbrously, CAMERA SWINGING and PULLING 
               BACK a few feet, away from the wall and into shot with 
               Johnnie, who steps forward into shot; Scully grabs Johnnie's 
               upper arm too. The Cowboy comes in close behind Scully; the 
               Easterner close behind the Swede, (in l.s.) the Easterner 
               alone among the men, is still trying to keep himself warm.

                                     SCULLY
                              (in a voice of iron 
                              authority)
                         All right now. Fight as ye are: ye'll 
                         not strip in this weather. Bare fists 
                         to a finish, no holds, no kneeing, 
                         no kicks, no gouging. Fight to be 
                         ended when ayther man calls quits or 
                         at me own discretion. That 
                         satisfactory?

               Johnnie and the Swede glance at Scully briefly and at each 
               other briefly. The Swede nods.

                                     JOHNNIE
                         Suits me.

               They keep on looking at each other, the Swede very pale and 
               still; Johnnie serene yet ferocious. Both are taking care 
               not to blink but the Swede blinks once; on Johnnie's face, 
               noting it, a calm flicker of contempt.

               Scully plants a hand on each chest and sets them away from 
               him and apart just out of each other's reach.

                                     SCULLY
                              (as he sets them apart)
                         Now await me signal and abide by me 
                         instructions.

               They raise their fists, Johnnie with something of the 
               suppleness of a good modern boxer of his time; the Swede 
               bearish and archaic, slightly suggesting early 19th century 
               boxing prints, pumping his fists just perceptibly. He stands 
               solid as rock, very heavy and dead on his feet but looks 
               hard to knock off them. The Cowboy, hands on sprung thighs 
               like a shortstop, face tight, eyes brilliant; the Easterner 
               hugging his arms, looking sick, glancing intently from fighter 
               to fighter. It is while CAMERA CENTERS on him or during his 
               close up that the storm seems to get its long mellow cry.

               CLOSER SHOT -- SWEDE

               The Cowboy and the Easterner are not in the shot unless in 
               the b.g. Pretty close on the Swede, CAMERA at about shoulder-
               height: he is pale, motionless, terrible; SWING to Scully, 
               the iron-nerved master-of-ceremony; then to Johnnie, serene 
               yet ferocious, brutish yet heroic; PULL AWAY and CENTER on 
               Scully with the Swede in r. s. and Johnnie in l.s.

                                     SCULLY
                              (after a sharp glance 
                              to each of them)
                         Now!
                              (no manual gesture)

               A NOTE ON THE FIGHT: This is to be a sensational fight but 
               not in any traditional melodramatic sense of that. It is 
               extremely violent but spasmodic, full of unskillfulness, and 
               very clumsy -- the clumsiness enhanced by heavy clothing and 
               by occasional veerings onto patches of glare-ice. Though the 
               violence is of itself shocking, the chief shock or sensational 
               element is getting the shock of two essential amateurs, non-
               fighters, in something close to mortal combat: almost as 
               disconcerting as if one saw a couple of clergymen trying to 
               beat each others' brains out. This can be arrived at through 
               the ice, heavy clothes, ungainliness and lack of skill. It 
               is also clear that you can kill a man whether you know how 
               or not. Both soon learn that in such heavy clothing 
               practically all that's worth trying to hit is the head; though 
               Johnnie, assuming that the Swede is soft in the middle, tries 
               pumping them into his belly with hard loud smacks of fists 
               against leather. The fight is not shot in detail or from 
               either fighter's angle, but as the spectators see it -- not 
               very clearly. SOUNDS of blows and breathings are way up. 
               Insofar as possible, the best fight would come of ad libbing 
               it, barring a few junctures necessary to the story.

               The two men crash together like bullocks and there is a 
               perplexity of flying arms. We so exaggerate the SOUND of the 
               crash that the audience feels it like a kick in the belly; 
               and instead of any sparring or fooling around they instantly 
               start socking with all their speed and strength. Both are 
               evidently trying for instant and pulverizing victory; also 
               it is very thoroughly a hatred-fight. They work with this 
               intensity as long as their first wind and strength holds. 
               They veer side to side and back and forth enough in this 
               first phase that the CAMERA has to waver back and fill a 
               little, but nothing special -- except that it should not 
               frame them too carefully or neatly. The spectators, moving 
               slightly when they need to, get into and out of shot ad lib. 
               As they first crash and sock, a squeezed curse, -- it is 
               indistinguishable from which fighter. (For 'curse,' try saying 
               the first 2/3rds of "God" and "Christ" simultaneously, from 
               between tight teeth).

               CLOSE SHOT -- THE EASTERNER

               His pent-up breath explodes with a pop of relief from the 
               tension of the preliminaries.

                                     COWBOY
                              (o.s., a sort of Texas 
                              yowl)

               CLOSE SHOT -- THE COWBOY

               In mid-yowl and in mid-air; he lands on his feet again and, 
               hands on knees, looks intently.

               CLOSE SHOT -- SCULLY

               Immovable as from supreme amazement and fear at the fury of 
               the fight which he himself had permitted and arranged.

               SOUNDS of fight are strong o.s. over all these shots.

               CLOSE SHOT -- SWEDE AND JOHNNIE

               and as suggested above; till they draw away to get their 
               wind; and they now come at it more cautiously. After some 
               sparring and some wild misses, the Swede becomes impatient 
               and tries to be a bulldozer; by his sudden drive toward the 
               CAMERA, the fighters all but knock it over, and the CAMERA 
               has to "step" quickly aside, mindful for a moment only of 
               its footing, as the fighters pass in a blur.

               MEDIUM SHOT -- REVERSE ANGLE

               The fighters are past the CAMERA which now, reversed on former 
               position, shoots away from the hotel wall; the three 
               spectators come slowly into the shot, flanking and back-to. 
               The drive continues though Johnnie is now giving near as 
               good as he gets; but retreating a little and wheeling. 
               Wheeling, they almost simultaneously hit glare-ice. Johnnie, 
               surer-footed, keeps his feet, the Swede falls heavily 
               backward, to some extent saving himself with one hand. Scully 
               comes up to them fast, the CAMERA nearly as fast; he 
               needlessly stays Johnnie with one hand for Johnnie is standing 
               a little too close over the Swede.

                                     JOHNNIE
                              (with what breath he 
                              has, but not jumping 
                              him)
                         Get up. Get up and fight. Get up.

               Scully has lifted his other hand as if for a count but the 
               Swede grunts:

                                     SWEDE
                         I ain't out.

                                     JOHNNIE
                         Don't lay there all night then you 
                         yellow...

                                     SCULLY
                         Shut up Johnnie it was no true fall. 
                         The man's got a right to...

               But already the Swede lumbers to his feet, dukes ready.

                                     SCULLY
                              (staying the Swede)
                         Git back off the ice both o' yez.

               He leads them in toward the hotel, the CAMERA PULLING BACK 
               with them, and steps back to the edge of shot, skidding a 
               little himself.

               A second's hesitation, the Swede seeming a little slow and 
               stunned, then Johnnie drives in on him with terrible 
               intensity, the Swede covering up clumsily, Johnnie working 
               mainly on the head.

               CLOSE QUICK SHOT -- THE COWBOY

               Looking much more excited than before.

               Johnnie is delivering hard, fast blows against the Swede's 
               hands which are trying to guard his head, and is then 
               hammering clublike wrists on the bowed nape of the Swede's 
               neck.

                                     COWBOY
                              (yelling and springing 
                              forward into the 
                              shot)
                         Go it Johnnie! Go it! Kill him! Kill 
                         him!

               Scully comes into shot quickly.

               CLOSE SHOT -- SCULLY AND COWBOY

                                     SCULLY
                              (barring him)
                         Kape back.

               By his glance the Cowboy can see that this man is Johnnie's 
               father. Scully's manner in this must be something to respect.

               MEDIUM SHOT -- THE FIGHTERS

               Johnnie is still hammering but has grown wholly careless of 
               his guard. Suddenly the Swede uncorks a sonofabitch to the 
               belly which doubles Johnnie, and misses a lulu to the head 
               as Johnnie ducks and backs off, getting his guard up; then 
               the Swede lands a wild one to the head which Johnnie 
               sufficiently covers and glances off that they are now again 
               somewhere near even. The Swede rushes it, taking as much as 
               he gives, which is plenty.

               CLOSE QUICK SHOT -- THE EASTERNER -- WATCHING MEDIUM SHOT -- 
               PAST THE EASTERNER

               A monotony of unchangeable fighting which is an abomination. 
               Both horribly skid but stay on their feet. As soon he has 
               his balance, the Swede closes and pours it on; Johnnie regains 
               equality; they lurch so near the Easterner that he has to 
               scramble hastily backward and we HEAR them breathe like men 
               on the rack.

               CLOSE SHOT -- THE EASTERNER

               His sickened face, wishing it would end, no matter how.

                                     COWBOY'S VOICE
                              (o.s., bellowing)
                         Kill him Johnnie! Kill him! Kill 
                         him!

               CLOSE SHOT -- THE COWBOY

               By the middle of the foregoing line. His face is contorted 
               like one of those agony masks in museums.

               CLOSE UP -- SCULLY

                                     SCULLY
                              (icily, to Cowboy)
                         Keep still.

               The Cowboy leans into the shot, puzzled and offended, looking 
               at Scully and Scully at him.

               SOUND o.s., of a sudden loud grunt, incomplete, cut short; 
               their eyes toward the fight.

               MEDIUM SHOT -- FROM ANGLE OF SCULLY AND COWBOY

               Johnnie's body swings away from the Swede and falls with 
               sickening heaviness. The Swede, with a kind of wild animal 
               snarl, (roughly, Arghrgh) is obviously about to swing himself 
               headlong on Johnnie.

               UPWARD SHOT -- ACROSS JOHNNIE

               SOUND o.s., of running as the Swede hovers. The Cowboy runs 
               into MEDIUM CLOSEUP and interposes an arm.

                                     COWBOY
                              (to the Swede)
                         No you don't! Wait a second!

               Scully hurries into the shot, nearer us, standing but leaning 
               over his son like a mother to a crib.

                                     SCULLY
                              (tenderly)
                         Johnnie! Johnnie, me boy! Johnnie! 
                         Can you go on with it?
                              (he is looking 
                              anxiously down)

               Bring CAMERA down into a CLOSE SHOT, almost upside down from 
               our angle, of Johnnie's bloody, pulpy face.

               Scully squats and his head returns into the shot, close above 
               Johnnie's. A moment of silence.

                                     JOHNNIE
                              (in his ordinary voice)
                         Yes, I... it... yes.

               Scully's arm under his nape and then his shoulders, tenderly, 
               nearest to us; clumsy, humiliated and piteous getting-up and 
               helping-up, mostly back-to the CAMERA. CAMERA LIFTING to 
               level of the standing men, brings in the Cowboy and the Swede 
               in b.g.,

                                     COWBOY
                              (still rumbling)
                         You wait a second.

               The Easterner steps into the shot at r.s., a hesitant hand 
               toward Scully's sleeve.

               As Johnnie gets fully to his feet, the CAMERA PULLS AROUND 
               his left shoulder; Scully still has an arm across his back; 
               the Easterner comes closer into the shot on the far side of 
               Scully. But the moment he gets his footing, Johnnie moves to 
               throw off his father's arm and veers toward the Swede, fists 
               readying, but obviously weak.

                                     SCULLY
                         Wait a bit now till you get your 
                         wind.

                                     COWBOY'S VOICE
                              (o.s.)
                         You wait a second.

                                     EASTERNER
                              (a hesitant hand at 
                              Scully's sleeve, a 
                              low sick voice, 
                              pleading)
                         Oh, this is enough! This is enough! 
                         Let it go as it stands. This is 
                         enough!

               During this speech, the CAMERA has PULLED AROUND so that 
               Scully is in full face CLOSE UP, the Easterner a pinched 
               profile at the side. Scully acts exactly as if he hadn't 
               heard except that his face gets hard as iron. We hear the 
               SOUND of Johnnie's wavy breathing but his face is not in the 
               shot.

                                     SCULLY
                              (coldly)
                         Bill.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- COWBOY -- FROM SCULLY'S ANGLE -- SWEDE 
               BEHIND HIM

               The Cowboy says nothing; an enquiring look.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- SCULLY AT CENTER, EASTERNER AND JOHNNIE

                                     SCULLY
                              (still more iron in 
                              his voice)
                         Git out o' the road.

               SOUND o.s. the Cowboy's backward step.

               MEDIUM SHOT -- FULL FACE, FULL LENGTH -- THE SWEDE

               Cowboy one more step back and at side. The Swede, fists coming 
               up, starts slowly, stonily forward.

               MEDIUM SHOT -- FULL FACE, FULL LENGTH -- JOHNNIE

               Scully stepping out of shot toward the CAMERA. Johnnie is 
               more cautious and much less arrogant than before: still half 
               stupid from weakness.

               After Johnnie's advance is started, the CAMERA PULLS OUT, 
               facing the wall and opposite the referee's position (the 
               three spectators pull close into a bunch), HOLDING Johnnie 
               in the shot in r.s., the Swede coming in from the left. The 
               Swede aims a lightning blow that carries with it his entire 
               weight. Johnnie, despite his daze, miraculously dodges. His 
               (Swede's) fist sends the overbalanced Swede sprawling (far 
               side of Johnnie, almost fouling up his feet) a brutally heavy 
               fall to shoulder and a hog-like grunt; a burst of cheering 
               from the three onlookers. The Swede cuts it short by scuffling 
               agilely to his feet and coming in berserk abandon at his 
               foe. Another blinding perplexity of flying arms and again, 
               not from any particular blow we can distinguish, Johnnie 
               swings away and falls, even as a bundle might fall from a 
               roof. The Swede staggers out of l.s. as the three others, 
               and the CAMERA, hurry to Johnnie.

               The CAMERA fetches up opposite Scully as he stoops, shooting 
               from a little above him, down on his face and on Johnnie. 
               Johnnie is lying on his face, the bloody backs of his unfisted 
               hands, are near his head, rather like a sleeping baby's, on 
               the snow. LOWER CAMERA CLOSER on to him, to height of Scully's 
               stooped head; TILT TO CLOSE UP of Scully's heartbroken face.

               MEDIUM CLOSE -- AT HEAD-HEIGHT -- COWBOY AND EASTERNER

               They are standing but leaning. The Cowboy is looking down, 
               past Scully, at Johnnie; so is the Easterner at first; then 
               he looks out l.s. toward the Swede.

               MEDIUM SHOT -- THE SWEDE -- FROM EASTERNER'S ANGLE

               He is leaning heavily against a little wind-waved tree, 
               breathing like an engine, while his savage and flame-lit 
               eyes roam from face to face... a mysterious and lonely figure, 
               waiting... a splendor of isolation in his situation.

               CLOSE SHOT -- EASTERNER

               His sad but awed reaction, still looking toward the Swede; 
               his eyes turn to Johnnie.

               CLOSE THREE SHOT -- JOHNNIE, SCULLY AND COWBOY

               Almost vertical over Johnnie as Scully and the Cowboy (who 
               has come opposite Scully) gently turn him onto his back, 
               their arms sustaining his head and chairing his shoulders a 
               little off the ground. The faces of Scully and the Cowboy 
               are hardly visible at this angle, and are drastically 
               foreshortened, so that the upper face of each looks like 
               some kind of grotesque mourning mask. Johnnie's face, cradled 
               up toward nearly vertical CAMERA, is also somewhat 
               foreshortened but much less so. It is ghastily beaten, 
               bloodied, cut and swollen, eyes shut, neck limp; head far 
               backward and point of chin highest at start of shot, then up 
               through normal view into aforementioned foreshortening; then 
               again to normal view. Blood has matted his dark hair to his 
               forehead and over one eye. Ice and snow are on his face like 
               a broken mask.

                                     SCULLY
                         Are you any good yet, Johnnie?

               Nothing from Johnnie.

               With his free right hand, tenderly as a woman, Scully smooths 
               back the clotted hair from the smeared, smooth, very young-
               looking forehead, and wipes away the ice and snow.

               Johnnie gasps and opens his eyes languidly.

                                     JOHNNIE
                              (after a moment)
                         No... I ain't... any good... any... 
                         more.
                              (he begins to cry)
                         He was too... too... too heavy for 
                         me.

               As Scully gets to his feet, PULL CAMERA up and back to center 
               on him in MEDIUM CLOSE UP from the Swede's angle. Cowboy and 
               Johnnie low in r.s., the Easterner still closer in l.s., 
               watching Scully. Scully straightens up.

                                     SCULLY
                              (evenly)
                         Stranger, it's all up with our side.

               The Easterner's eyes to the Swede, quickly back to Scully.

               CLOSE UP -- SAME ANGLE -- SCULLY

                                     SCULLY
                              (quietly tragic)
                         Johnnie is whipped.

               MEDIUM SHOT -- SWEDE

               Without replying, he leaves his tree, walks toward and past 
               them, CAMERA keeping him centered, the Easterner's eyes 
               following him, Scully not moving or looking at anything: 
               CAMERA SWINGS with the Swede (who passes between it and the 
               hotel wall) and HOLDS ON HIM as he passes out of the lee of 
               the house to where the wind hits him like a Mack truck and 
               tears at his clothes; he disappears bowed-over deeply, back-
               to the storm.

               CLOSE SHOT -- EASTERNER

               His eyes return from the Swede, absently and indifferently, 
               toward Johnnie. He is chiefly aware that he is freezing. 
               Bring up SOUND of storm strongly.

               CLOSE SHOT -- COWBOY

               His crumpled, leaning face, from Johnnie's angle.

                                     COWBOY
                              (whispering)
                         Tsah-right Johnnie. Tsah-right kid. 
                         We'll fix him. We'll sure fix him.

               CLOSE SHOT -- SCULLY

               His eyes are still on the Swede's face but are out of focus. 
               He has not moved since his surrender. His face has changed 
               only in looking still older, more stern, more sad, more 
               tragic. He lowers his eyes and stoops toward Johnnie.

               CLOSE THREE SHOT -- CENTERED ON JOHNNIE

               The Cowboy has him half-sitting; Cowboy's profile r.s., 
               Scully's comes into shot at left; Johnnie's eyes are avoiding 
               everything. Scully puts out a hand toward an instinctive 
               caress and quickly withdraws it.

                                     SCULLY
                         Johnnie, can you walk?

                                     JOHNNIE
                         Did I hurt... hurt him any?

                                     SCULLY
                         Can you walk, boy! Can you walk!

                                     JOHNNIE
                              (with robust impatience)
                         I asked you if I hurt him any!

                                     COWBOY
                         Yes, yes, Johnnie, he's hurt a good 
                         deal.

                                     SCULLY
                              (to Cowboy)
                         Let's get him up, Bill.

               CAMERA PULLS SLOWLY BACK and up with them:

               They get well under him and lift; he winces and gasps in 
               spite of himself.

                                     SCULLY
                         Aisy does it. That's the ticket.

                                     COWBOY
                         How's 'at now?

               Johnnie savagely shakes off their hands, totters toward the 
               CAMERA, quickly gets his bearings and turns, walks between 
               them and leads them, back-to the CAMERA, toward the corner 
               of the hotel. Scully and the Cowboy fall in, timidly guardian-
               like, just behind each shoulder; the Easterner, who has not 
               moved since the Swede left, falls in behind them.

               BOOM SHOT -- THE GROUP

               From just above and ahead of them as they flounder along 
               past the faade of the hotel toward the door. Storm SOUNDS 
               up.

               The Swede's staggering, shapeless tracks are still conspicuous 
               in the difficult snow; Johnnie, in the lead, avoids making 
               use of them. After a few paces he flounders badly in the 
               drift near the door: the Cowboy and Scully, flanking him, 
               are alert but still shy to touch him. They are all practically 
               blinded by the blowing snow. After another couple of steps 
               Johnnie is about to fall: the Cowboy comes swiftly to him, 
               obviously shouting something the screaming wind tears away 
               from us; Johnnie fights him off furiously and lunges ahead, 
               CAMERA stooping swiftly as he falls: the Cowboy swiftly to 
               him; Scully's heartsick face is disclosed as the Cowboy 
               stoops, and Easterner's frozen face behind him as Scully 
               leans; the CAMERA on down to the Cowboy and Johnnie as the 
               Cowboy picks him up as if he were a child and staggers with 
               him up the drifted steps, Johnnie protesting violently, Scully 
               hurrying ahead to get the door open.

               FULL SHOT -- MAIN ROOM -- INT

               From same position of last interior shot, from deepest indoor 
               corner. For perhaps a half-second, SOUND of ferocious 
               crackling of the stove and the wrestling trouble inside the 
               lamp in l.s., then the door closes; we hear the SOUND of 
               falling cards; the lamp rights itself and burns steadily.

               The Cowboy, painfully embarrassed, is just setting Johnnie 
               on his feet; the Easterner has just got inside; Scully is 
               shutting the door. The Cowboy is slow, embarrassed, careful 
               not to walk ahead of Johnnie; Johnnie, rubber-legged and 
               intensely humiliated, wobbles toward the stove; Scully is at 
               his shoulder, taking great care not to touch him or say 
               anything; the Easterner, the last in, walks as fast as he 
               can past them and up to the stove -- CAMERA ADJUSTING to 
               center on him -- almost as if he would embrace the stove: he 
               is desperately cold and his face looks like ice. We look 
               past the stove at his face and past that as the CAMERA DOLLIES 
               into position where all the chairs will be visible, MEDIUM 
               CLOSE. As the others come up, the Easterner quits hogging 
               the stove, moves aside to l.s. chair nearest the wall; Johnnie 
               sinks into a chair and, folding his arms on his knees, buries 
               his face in them.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- SCULLY

               Standing, Scully warms one foot and then the other at the 
               rim of the stove; he shakes his head quietly, looking down 
               at the hot shoe, making tst-tst-tst with his tongue.

               SWING CAMERA to the Cowboy, also standing; removing his cap 
               with a dazed, rueful air, running one hand through his tousled 
               locks. SOUND o.s., of the floor creaking and a heavy step; 
               he glances toward the ceiling sadly and grimly.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- SCULLY

               SOUND of another creak or step. He doesn't look up; his head 
               bows a little.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- GROUP

               On the stove, and beyond it, the dining room door. CAMERA at 
               standing height shooting downwards across Johnnie's bowed 
               head (he is back-to us); the Easterner's subtle, melancholy 
               profile; the slack hands and bodies, not the heads, of the 
               two standing men. o.s. the SOUND of another creak or footstep; 
               minimal reaction from the men; then a sudden bursting SOUND, 
               the noise of a door flung open, (we can see a little of this 
               and of those who enter, past the stove in b.g.): the Easterner 
               listlessly raises his eyes as the CAMERA lifts swiftly past 
               the bovine head of the Cowboy and the resigned, caught-with-
               pants-down head of Scully, to catch the wife and daughter 
               swarming in, oh-ohing and ad libbing brogue lamentations.

               Mrs. Scully shoulders swiftly past the men toward Johnnie; 
               CAMERA closes onto her in CLOSE UP, at her speed, above 
               Johnnie. She is a wiry, fierce, worn-out woman of 55.

                                     MRS. SCULLY
                              (crossing to him)
                         Did he hurt ye child did he hurt ye 
                         so bad?
                              (she squats in front 
                              of him)
                         Lookit me Johnnie let me see yez.
                              (Under this Johnnie, 
                              from his first hearing 
                              of them, has been 
                              shrinking into himself 
                              and now mutters across 
                              her line)

                                     JOHNNIE
                              (muttering)
                         Cut it out Ma...
                              (a couple of half-
                              whispered words, 
                              covered by loud talk 
                              from her...)
                         ...sake cut it out!

               But she is tugging at his wrists and putting a hand under 
               his forehead to lift his face while he still groans, head 
               muffled in hands,

                                     JOHNNIE
                         Please! Please! Quit it! Le' me be!

               But he knows there's no use and she gets his face up (away 
               from us) and gives a close quick look and then a low keening 
               wail as tears spring out of her and she turns loose of his 
               stubborn humiliated head to bring her hands incompletely 
               toward the primordial gesture of tearing her hair at the 
               temples.

                                     MRS. SCULLY
                              (hands distrait in 
                              the uncompleted 
                              gesture: a wailing 
                              sob)
                         Ohh, me boy! Me little boy! And him 
                         sitchy charmer! Lookit 'im Katy! 
                         Jist lookit that! Ohh ain't it 
                         dreadful, did you ever see sitch a 
                         starin' horror!

               With "and him sitchy charmer," CAMERA PULLS BACK and up a 
               little; through the rest of her lines and, the CAMERA, from 
               the same position, does quick flicking shots like glances of 
               the eye, centering reactions of one or another of the men in 
               turn and of the daughter -- shots A, B, C, et seq. The 
               daughter meanwhile is horning in ad lib with "Ohh," and "Aww" 
               and "Johnnie dear," "ain't it just awful," "it's a sinful 
               shame," etc., and by a violence of gesture and voice, Mrs. 
               Scully drags CAMERA (by quick cut and a shade belated) back 
               to MEDIUM CLOSE UP of herself past Johnnie's bowed head.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- MRS. SCULLY

               As she flings herself on her knees before Johnnie, catches 
               his face between her hands, already talking loudly.

                                     MRS. SCULLY
                              (in a mixture to her 
                              son and the room at 
                              large)
                         Crazy ye are, jist outa yer mind, 
                         an' him a man twice his age an' size, 
                         the great bullyin' murderer...

                                     JOHNNIE
                              (across her lines, in 
                              rage, humiliation 
                              and disgust)
                         Get away, cut it out, quit it I tell 
                         ya, I ain't hurt bad, I'm all right...

                                     SCULLY
                              (leaning weakly into 
                              shot, aghast with 
                              disgust and sympathy 
                              for Johnnie; in a 
                              weak voice)
                         Molly!
                              (she neither hears 
                              nor sees him)
                         Molly! Please! Molly! Hush now! Molly! 
                         Not here. Molly!

               Mrs. Scully does a slow take on him when she finally hears 
               him, cuts off her former lines and whips her head at him.

                                     MRS. SCULLY
                              (with cold fury)
                         Shut up an' keep outa this, you! 
                         Haven't ya done enough, standin' by 
                         while a man half kills my baby boy?
                              (her eyes rake all of 
                              them)
                         Crazy men! Bloodthirsty brutes!
                              (her daughter echoes 
                              her less noisily, ad 
                              lib)

               Mrs. Scully starts bustling up from her knees, CAMERA RISING 
               with her.

                                     MRS. SCULLY
                              (rising)
                         Poor darlin'! Crazy boy, brawlin' 
                         young fool, now jist come with mother, 
                         gently darlin', come darlin', kin ye 
                         walk, son? Come on, let's bathe the 
                         poor blood off an' fix 'im up comfy.

               Johnnie meanwhile is still protesting ad lib and is trying 
               at least to walk alone, as he had with the men, but not a 
               chance; they wholly disregard his gestures of pride, his 
               efforts to shake them off. With ad libs of "Silly boy," and 
               such, they cling to him like limpets, helping him out past 
               the stove and thence toward the dining room door.

               CAMERA meanwhile, SLOWLY TRACKS crabwise, parallel with the 
               wall opposite the coatroom, so that until they get past the 
               stove they are in a kind of Recessional from the CAMERA.

               They reach the far side of the stove from the CAMERA

                                     MRS. SCULLY
                              (straightening; 
                              reproachfully)
                         Shame be upon you, Patrick Scully! 
                         Yer own son, too! Shame be upon you!

                                     DAUGHTER
                              (ad lib)
                         Shame, shame.

               Scully has huddled meekly out of their path but now comes 
               close to the stove as if he needed the warmth.

                                     SCULLY
                              (gently, almost 
                              inaudibly, meeting 
                              no eyes)
                         There, now! Be quiet now!

                                     MRS. SCULLY
                         Shame, I say. Shame.

               They turn toward the door on the far side of the stove; the 
               CAMERA continues its crabwise glide and stops when stove 
               centers and blanks out screen, but SWINGS to HOLD them as 
               they half-carry Johnnie back through the dining room door, 
               side and back-to the CAMERA; the door closes.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- THE THREE MEN

               Over the SOUND of the closing door cut to a new angle, from 
               the same position, MEDIUM CLOSE of the survivors. The 
               Easterner, l.s., is in near profile; a crescent of empty 
               chairs; the Cowboy is standing behind between two chairs; 
               Scully is all but hidden by the stove. Scully walks slowly 
               into the shot, sits down slowly and sadly in the chair next 
               Johnnie's (next the Easterner, it stays empty); hangs his 
               hands between his knees. His head is bowed; he wags it slowly, 
               sighs very deeply; head still.

               The Cowboy, deeply sad and embarrassed, walks slowly around 
               a farther chair and sits, facing the CAMERA, staring at the 
               stove. The Easterner just looks at the floor.

                                     SCULLY
                              (after a long pause)
                         Tst-tst-tst.

               The Cowboy exhales a deep damp breath through o-ed lips.

               The Easterner's hand is on his knee, flat and limp except 
               for the forefinger, which he slowly raises and brings down, 
               repeatedly.

               The Cowboy gets his sack and papers part way out, puts them 
               back.

                                     SCULLY
                         Tst-tst-tst.

               SOUND o.s. of the creaking board in the Swede's room. From 
               Scully, a short sharp intake of breath, no raising of the 
               eyes. The Cowboy's eyes don't raise but they harden. He 
               glances with shy calculation at Scully and at the Easterner 
               and again at Scully.

                                     COWBOY
                              (carefully)
                         I'd like to fight this here Swede 
                         myself.

               The Easterner's hand goes still, forefinger up in the air; 
               no change in his eyes.

                                     SCULLY
                              (tempted for a moment, 
                              then, wagging his 
                              head sadly)
                         No, that wouldn't do. It wouldn't be 
                         right. It wouldn't be right.

                                     COWBOY
                              (knowing why but making 
                              him say it)
                         Well why wouldn't it I don't see no 
                         harm in it.
                              (he looks to Easterner 
                              whose eyes do not 
                              change)

               The Easterner's finger is lifted a little higher; motionless 
               again.

                                     SCULLY
                              (with mournful heroism)
                         No, it wouldn't be right. It was 
                         Johnnie's fight, and now we musn't 
                         whip the man just because he whipped 
                         Johnnie.

               The Easterner's finger relaxes and stays flat.

                                     COWBOY
                         Yes, that's true enough, but
                              (hopefully)
                         he better not get fresh with me, 
                         because I couldn't stand no more of 
                         it.

                                     SCULLY
                              (commandingly)
                         Ye'll not say a word to him.

               Under Scully's line, the SOUND of the Swede's heavy tread on 
               the stairs. Hearing it, Scully makes his last couple of words 
               all but inaudible. None of them look up or register hearing, 
               but all go very still. The Swede enters "theatrically," his 
               cap on, sweeps the stairway door shut with a bang, and 
               swaggers to the middle of the room. He is dressed to go and 
               carries his valise in his hand. He has washed his face but 
               even from here we can see that it is bleeding again in two 
               or three places. Nobody looks at him, or even looks up. All 
               sit side or back to him, facing the CAMERA.

                                     SWEDE
                              (loud and insolent, 
                              to Scully)
                         Well, I spose you'll tell me now how 
                         much I owe you?

                                     SCULLY
                              (no move or look; 
                              stolidly)
                         You don't owe me nothin'.

                                     COWBOY
                              (turning slowly to 
                              look at Swede)
                         Stranger, I don't see how you come 
                         to be so gay around here.

                                     SCULLY
                              (shouting across the 
                              last words, a hand 
                              forth almost in 
                              Cowboy's face, palm 
                              out, fingers straight 
                              up)
                         Stop! Bill, you shut up!

                                     COWBOY
                              (spitting carelessly 
                              into the cuspidor)
                         I didn't say a word, did I?

               The Swede has been watching this, his body tightening like a 
               fist, but quite unfrightened; as he sees there will be no 
               fight, a sour spasm of smile.

                                     SWEDE
                              (interrupting Cowboy)
                         Mr. Scully, how much do I owe you?

                                     SCULLY
                              (imperturbably; as 
                              before)
                         You don't owe me nothin'.

                                     SWEDE
                         Huh! I guess you're right. I guess 
                         if it was any way at all, you'd owe 
                         me somethin'. That's what I guess.
                              (he pivots fast and 
                              rigidly and takes 
                              two paces toward the 
                              Cowboy; then, leaning 
                              forward, stiff-legged 
                              from his heels, and 
                              mimicking even the 
                              Cowboy's agony-mask, 
                              screams)
                         Kill 'im! Kill 'im! Kill 'im!
                              (he guffaws 
                              victoriously)
                         Kill 'im!

               He is convulsed with ironical laughter. He watches them with 
               great interest and delight all the time he laughs. He bites 
               it off sudden and cold. There is an arrogant and expectant 
               silence.

               But the three men are immovable and silent. As throughout 
               this act of the Swede's, they stare with glassy eyes at the 
               stove. They hold it while he waits for trouble, and while he 
               walks leisurely to the front door and, with one last derisive 
               glance at the still group, passes into the storm.

               After the door closes (omit all former STORM EFFECTS except 
               a moment's howl of wind while the door is open) hold a few 
               seconds of absolute stillness. Then the Cowboy and Scully 
               jump up and begin to tramp around. The Easterner stays very 
               still in his chair, hardly, if at all, even looking at them; 
               but listening.

                                     COWBOY
                              (whipping from his 
                              chair; fist hard 
                              into palm)
                         Unh! Byg! Golly!

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- REVERSE ANGLE -- COWBOY

               He circles behind his chair; he is finishing the above line; 
               the first words of Scully lines, o.s., come over this shot; 
               Cowboy's eyes to him.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- SCULLY -- PAST COWBOY

               His fists are shaking with great intensity near his temples; 
               he is working his way out between the chairs and toward the 
               Cowboy.

                                     SCULLY
                         Oh, but that was a hard minute! That 
                         was a hard minute! Him there leerin' 
                         an' scoffin'!
                              (he is pretty CLOSE 
                              now, WHEEL CAMERA 
                              for TWO SHOT, still 
                              favoring Scully)
                         One bang at his nose was worth forty 
                         dollars to me that minute! How did 
                         you stand it, Bill!

               The Cowboy and Scully are equal in the shot now.

                                     COWBOY
                              (a quivering voice)
                         How did I stand it? How did I stand 
                         it? OH!
                              (a violent fist through 
                              the air)

               CAMERA PULLS BACK a little, follows Scully. Scully begins 
               paddling back and forth in front of the Cowboy (who stands 
               sort of treading water, making hard little shadow-boxing 
               jabs); Scully's hands are close together; his shoulders are 
               hunched, he is rapidly hammering fist into palm and wailing 
               in deep brogue:

                                     SCULLY
                         Oi'd loike to take that Swede and 
                         hould him down on a shtone flure and 
                         bate 'im to a jelly wid a shtick!

                                     COWBOY
                              (up to him and almost 
                              groaning in sympathy)
                         I'd like to git 'im by the neck and 
                         h-ha-aaammer 'im...
                              (speechless, a hand 
                              down on a chairback 
                              with a SOUND like a 
                              pistol shot)
                         ...hammer that there Dutchman till 
                         he couldn't tell himself from a dead 
                         coyote!

               Toward the end of the Cowboy's lines, CAMERA favors Scully's 
               reaction.

               CLOSE SHOT -- SCULLY

               Eyes to the Cowboy leaning into upper l.s., Scully is almost 
               crying with the lust of this kind of self-abuse.

                                     SCULLY
                         I'd bate 'im until he...

               CLOSE SHOT -- COWBOY

               Past Scully's round little head.

                                     COWBOY
                              (tries to speak; unable)

               CLOSE SHOT -- SCULLY -- FROM COWBOY'S ANGLE

               He looks grateful, even loving -- and as if he could hardly 
               wait, and as if he wants to prompt him like a stutterer.

               CLOSE SHOT -- COWBOY

                                     COWBOY
                              (he looks loving too)
                         I'd show him some things...

               CLOSE SHOT -- SCULLY

               Satisfied, nodding very rapidly but curtly; almost the 
               masculine equivalent of an old-maid gossip's 'yes-yes-yes.'

               CLOSE TWO SHOT -- COWBOY AND SCULLY

               Faces contorted, a kind of gloating; as if embracing in 
               operatic duet, they look almost straight into the lens.

                                     COWBOY AND SCULLY
                              (almost in unison: a 
                              yearning, fanatic 
                              cry)
                         Oh-o-OH! If we only could...

               They look at each other with breathless and terrible yearning 
               and again speak almost in unison.

                                     COWBOY
                         YES!

                                     SCULLY
                         YISS!

               The CAMERA SWINGS to lose them, bringing in their inane 
               shadows on the wall opposite the lamp, chasing each other in 
               circles.

                                     COWBOY'S VOICE
                              (o.s.)
                         An' then I'd...
                              (a sock)

                                     SCULLY'S VOICE
                              (o.s.)
                         Yis, an' I'd...
                              (more socking)

                                     COWBOY'S VOICE
                              (o.s.)
                         Yeah, an I'd...
                              (a terrific blow on 
                              the air; four hard 
                              fast jabs, a gigantic 
                              uppercut, hard 
                              breathing)

                                     SCULLY'S VOICE
                              (o.s.; a fierce grunt 
                              of hatred and effort; 
                              he kicks something 
                              which is prostrate)

                                     COWBOY'S VOICE
                              (o.s.)
                         A-aaahhh!
                              (he jumps up and down 
                              on it)

                                     SCULLY'S VOICE
                              (o.s.)
                         Oh-o-OH!

                                     COWBOY'S VOICE
                              (o.s.)
                         Oh-o-OH!

               Over Scully's grunting and kicking

                                                                    CUT TO:

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- THE EASTERNER

               He is staring at the stove, hands slack on his knees; he is 
               listening keenly. As contempt and self-contempt increase in 
               his face beyond silence, CREEP CAMERA INTO CLOSE UP.

                                     EASTERNER
                              (quiet but piercing)
                         Oh, stop it!

               MEDIUM SHOT -- SCULLY AND COWBOY -- NEUTRAL ANGLE

               They are as arrested by his words as in a stopshot. They 
               look toward him, more surprised than offended.

                                     COWBOY
                         How's that, pardner?

                                     SCULLY
                              (at same time)
                         Eh?

               MEDIUM SHOT -- EASTERNER -- SAME POSITION, NEW ANGLE

                                     EASTERNER
                              (quietly contemptuous)
                         I said, stop it.
                              (he gets up and walks 
                              toward CAMERA and 
                              out of shot toward 
                              the front of the 
                              room. Over his next 
                              line, CAMERA SWINGS 
                              across Cowboy and 
                              Scully, watching 
                              him, astonished; 
                              loses them and again 
                              picks up Easterner 
                              as he nears the 
                              stairway door.)
                         Surely there's some limit to 
                         childishness and cowardice and shame!

                                     COWBOY'S VOICE
                              (o.s.)
                         What's eatin' you, Mister?

               The Easterner pauses abruptly at the door.

                                     EASTERNER
                         That's all. I'm going to find that 
                         Swede and try to make up for what 
                         we've done to him.

               He goes through the door and starts upstairs.

               MEDIUM SHOT -- SCULLY AND COWBOY -- FROM ANGLE OF DOOR

               Slowly, dumbfounded, they turn and look at each other. o.s. 
               SOUND the Easterner's footsteps and, just audible, a train 
               whistle.

               LONG SHOT -- EXT. (NITE)

               Shooting down the narrow boardwalk from the corner of town 
               (edge of a building in r.s. toward the hotel and station. 
               Minimal lighting. Same SOUND of shrieking wind and blowing 
               snow as before; same SOUND of storm and high, timbreless 
               scream at the edge of audibility. The line of the boardwalk 
               is marked by a little line of naked, gasping trees. In the 
               deep distance, when blowing snow allows, we see the small, 
               single, stinging light of the station.

               The Swede is about halfway between the hotel and the edge of 
               town, coming toward us floundering, struggling into the eye 
               of the wind, with terrifying spirit and energy -- carrying 
               his big valise and now and then clutching his cap almost 
               like Harry Langdon. Within a few seconds (see note below for 
               method) he comes a full hundred yards. CAMERA shoots him at 
               shoulder height, a little upward toward his face. As he gets 
               nearer an ordinary CLOSE UP the CAMERA PULLS BACK. For a 
               moment he just wags his head a little, fast, almost 
               paretically, looking all around; growing in his face is a 
               hunger for enormity, violence, bragging, love, glory, 
               something, anything so long as it is huge enough to meet him 
               half-way. Suddenly he opens his mouth and yells at the top 
               of his lungs -- then stands, like an idling locomotive, 
               breathing quiet and fast through clenched teeth. Then his 
               hands begin to move; fists hitting the air. Becoming aware 
               of the suitcase, heavy in his right hand, he mingles grinning 
               and weeping and moaning and hits it as hard as he can with 
               his left fist, and drops it and kicks it twice, three times, 
               as hard as he can. It isn't enough for his desperation and 
               joy; again he scans the darkness; and suddenly, with his 
               right fist, he hits himself as hard as he able on the joint 
               of the jaw. He reels a little with the blow and whispers 
               something, and stoops and picks up his valise (CAMERA adjusts 
               to these violences). As he straightens and starts down the 
               street into the middle of the town, he is smiling with a 
               strange peacefulness and hope and sweetness -- a tired Pilgrim 
               on the homestretch to Paradise.

               The CAMERA PANS as he passes closer, and centers on him as 
               he plods down the middle of the snow-foundered, lightless 
               street.

               (A NOTE ON THIS SHOT): It is to be heightened above realism, 
               during the Swede's advance up the boardwalk. When he is still 
               in the deepest distance, we use only every third frame; then 
               every second; then cut every third frame; then every fourth; 
               meanwhile slurring the CAMERA speed a little, fewer frames 
               per second, so that his speed of approach is at all time 
               superhuman and grotesque, but becomes smoother as he 
               approaches. By the time his features become distinct no frames 
               are skipped but the motion, though regular, is fast and dry 
               rather than silky; it is at this time and pace that the train 
               is run through. As he comes into full close up, shade back 
               to normal speed, omitting no frames. The SOUND runs smooth, 
               not clipped; it is not recorded on the spot.

               MEDIUM SHOT -- MAIN ROOM -- INT

               The staircase door; o.s. the SOUND of the fast train quickly 
               dies. The Easterner comes through the door with his traveling 
               bag, ready to go. His eyes meet Scully's o.s., and he pauses. 
               He is quiet and grave.

               MEDIUM SHOT -- COWBOY AND SCULLY -- FROM EASTERNER'S VIEWPOINT

               They stand waiting for him in the middle of the room and 
               looking at him with a kind of mystified grimness.

                                     SCULLY
                              (quiet and reasonable)
                         Now Mr. Blanc, what's all this about?

               MEDIUM SHOT -- THE EASTERNER

               He walks toward them, extending his hand

               MEDIUM CLOSE THREE SHOT -- SCULLY, COWBOY, EASTERNER

               As the Easterner walks into the shot, offering Scully coins,

                                     EASTERNER
                              (quietly)
                         Here's what I owe you Mr. Scully.

                                     SCULLY
                              (not accepting)
                         What's your complaint? I thought we 
                         was friends here.

                                     EASTERNER
                         Please. Take it. There's no time to 
                         waste.

               Scully makes no move to accept the money.

                                     COWBOY
                              (incredulous)
                         You fer that Dutchman?

                                     SCULLY
                         Yes, what is this about the Swede?

               A brief pause: the Easterner's feeling conquers his aversion 
               against going into it. They watch him judicially.

                                     EASTERNER
                              (quietly)
                         We've done him a great wrong.

                                     COWBOY
                              (astounded)
                         Huh?

                                     SCULLY
                         Wrong! We couldn't treat him fairer -- 
                         we never touched a hair of his head!

                                     EASTERNER
                              (quiet but feeling it 
                              strongly)
                         Ah you don't know the meaning of 
                         fairness. Either of you.

               They move nearer him; he stands his ground. CAMERA SLOWLY 
               CREEPS CLOSER.

                                     COWBOY
                         Now you look here, Mister...

                                     SCULLY
                              (Solemn and quiet; 
                              slowly tapping 
                              Easterner's chest 
                              with his forefinger)
                         See here, Sir: guest or no guest, 
                         nobody can tell Patrick Scully he 
                         ain't a fair man.

                                     EASTERNER
                         Suppose I prove it.

                                     SCULLY
                         Try, just. Fair enough. But Mister: 
                         ye better make it shtick!

                                     COWBOY
                         That goes for me too.

                                     EASTERNER
                         Very well.

               He sets down his bag as the CAMERA stops advancing: A CLOSE 
               THREE SHOT, favoring the Easterner. He looks coldly from one 
               to the other as he talks. They watch him judicially.

                                     EASTERNER
                         When the Swede said Johnnie was 
                         cheating, and Johnnie called him a 
                         liar, it was one man's word against 
                         another. Am I right?

               They nod, with a look, "of course."

                                     EASTERNER
                         That was all we had to go on to 
                         prevent a fight. Correct?

                                     SCULLY
                         Correct.

                                     EASTERNER
                         All right.
                              (very quiet and cold)
                         Did it occur to either of you that 
                         the Swede might be telling the truth?

               CLOSE TWO SHOT -- COWBOY AND SCULLY

                                     COWBOY AND SCULLY
                              (together; vaguely)
                         Truth?

               CLOSE SHOT -- EASTERNER

               He is watching them mercilessly.

                                     EASTERNER
                              (icy; just audible)
                         Mm-hm. That's the word.

               CLOSE TWO SHOT -- COWBOY AND SCULLY

                                     COWBOY AND SCULLY
                              (gaping, incredulous, 
                              innocent)
                         HIM?

               CLOSE SHOT -- EASTERNER

               He watches them a moment very tensely, then abrupty relaxes.

                                     EASTERNER
                              (throwing it away)
                         Thank you, gentlemen: there's your 
                         proof.
                              (again trying to pay)
                         Now please...

               CLOSE THREE SHOT -- EASTERNER, COWBOY, SCULLY

               CAMERA circles, favoring each man as he speaks.

                                     SCULLY
                              (intensely)
                         Are you accusin' Johnnie of...

                                     EASTERNER
                              (quiet, cold)
                         I'm accusing nobody. I'm proving you 
                         don't know the a-b-c-'s of fairness.

                                     COWBOY
                         But that Dutchman, he's crazy.

                                     EASTERNER
                              (biting the words out)
                         Stick to the point.

                                     SCULLY
                         If he ever did tell the truth -- an' 
                         that I beg leave to doubt -- it'd be 
                         the first time in his life.

                                     EASTERNER
                         That would make it a lie?

                                     COWBOY
                         Good as a lie.

               Scully nods.

                                     EASTERNER
                         Fine. Splendid.

               CAMERA, shooting past the Easterner, favoring the Cowboy, 
               stops circling.

                                     COWBOY
                         Why, that bird, if he did tell the 
                         truth, I wouldn't keer.

               CLOSE SHOT -- EASTERNER

                                     EASTERNER
                              (to both)
                         You've proved my point several times 
                         over; don't strain yourselves.

               His eyes glide quietly from man to man.

               CLOSE TWO SHOT -- COWBOY AND SCULLY

               A pause. They are cornered; half-comprehending, deeply 
               resentful. They are in some degree trying to face it.

               CLOSE SHOT -- EASTERNER

               In deep stillness he watches them.

               CLOSER TWO SHOT -- COWBOY AND SCULLY

               The effort to face it weakens; they glance toward him almost 
               reproachfully and look quickly down; they glance toward each 
               other but their eyes don't meet. Each does his equivalent of 
               a shrug.

               LESS CLOSE SHOT -- THE EASTERNER

               He looks at them in silence a moment.

                                     EASTERNER
                              (quietly)
                         That's right; shrug it off; it's a 
                         small matter. It's why wars are 
                         fought; why a great nation can fall 
                         apart like rotten meat.

                                     COWBOY'S VOICE
                              (o.s., booming)
                         Yeah? Well what're you...

               CLOSE SHOT -- COWBOY

               SWING CAMERA to bring in Scully, reacting.

                                     COWBOY
                              (continuing)
                         ...talkin' so high and mighty about, 
                         I want to know! You was there too, 
                         but I didn't notice you sayin' 
                         nuthin'!

               The shot now favors Scully.

                                     SCULLY
                              (eager, vindictive)
                         Now how about, yes how about that! 
                         Tarred with the same brush, ain't 
                         you?

               They look to him in bitter triumph.

               CLOSE SHOT -- EASTERNER

               A pause as he returns their gaze.

                                     EASTERNER
                              (with calm self-
                              loathing)
                         Oh no. A blacker brush.
                              (still quieter)
                         You see: I knew.

               CLOSE TWO SHOT -- COWBOY AND SCULLY

               They are held in a strange, prescient pause.

               CLOSE SHOT -- EASTERNER

                                     EASTERNER
                              (very quietly)
                         Yes: Johnnie was cheating.

               CLOSE TWO SHOT -- COWBOY AND SCULLY

                                     COWBOY AND SCULLY
                              (blankly)
                         Johnnie...

               CLOSE SHOT -- EASTERNER

               He nods, watching them closely.

               CLOSE TWO SHOT -- COWBOY AND SCULLY

               A silence. We can almost see their wheels go round. Finally, 
               relief and pleasure dawn in the Cowboy's face. As he starts 
               to speak he makes a foolish, rather pathetically helpless 
               gesture, and CAMERA PULLS AND SWINGS to bring in the 
               Easterner.

                                     COWBOY
                         Why, no. We wasn't playin' fer money. 
                         It was just in fun.

               Scully nods, hopefully. The Easterner's reaction to the word 
               "money" is quiet, sick, ineffable contempt.

                                     EASTERNER
                              (unconsciously; just 
                              audibly)
                         Oh, yes!

               The MOVING CAMERA now favors the Easterner in the THREE SHOT

                                     EASTERNER
                         Fun or not, Johnnie was cheating. I 
                         saw him. I know it. I saw him.

               A pause.

                                     SCULLY
                              (solemnly)
                         Mister: I don't believe you.

                                     EASTERNER
                         Why would I lie to you?

                                     COWBOY
                         That's for you to tell us.

               In spite of everything, there is a flicker of amusement in 
               the Easterner over this lulu.

                                     SCULLY
                              (shrewdly)
                         Ye lied before or now, by yer own 
                         admission. I'll take me pick.

                                     EASTERNER
                              (mildly)
                         I lied when I kept quiet.

                                     SCULLY
                         Why? If ye saw what ye claim?

               A pause. CAMERA moves into CLOSE SHOT of the Easterner, losing 
               them.

                                     EASTERNER
                              (quietly)
                         Cowardice.

               CLOSE TWO SHOT -- SCULLY AND COWBOY

               They can't comprehend or believe such an admission.

               CLOSE SHOT -- EASTERNER

                                     EASTERNER
                         That's all.
                              (his eyes show us 
                              they still can't 
                              understand; with 
                              self-contempt and 
                              weary patience)
                         We hated the Swede; you believed 
                         Johnnie; you liked me. I wasn't man 
                         enough to make enemies of you. I let 
                         that poor fool fight it out alone.

               He looks from man to man in silence.

               CLOSE TWO SHOT -- SCULLY AND COWBOY

               They are silent a moment.

                                     SCULLY
                              (quietly)
                         Then why're ye tellin' us now?

               CLOSE SHOT -- EASTERNER

                                     EASTERNER
                         Because there's a limit to cowardice.

               CLOSE TWO SHOT -- SCULLY AND COWBOY

               A short silence as they ponder that.

                                     COWBOY
                              (solemnly)
                         Mister, if you're tellin' the truth, 
                         you're makin' yerself out the 
                         yallerist coward ever I seen.

               CLOSE SHOT -- EASTERNER

               PULLING BACK, as he speaks, into a CLOSE THREE SHOT

                                     EASTERNER
                         Oh, we're all cowards; that's the 
                         root of the trouble. Johnnie is behind 
                         us; you're afraid to face the truth 
                         about him and your own unfairness; 
                         I'm just the worst of a bad bunch.

               A short pause.

                                     SCULLY
                              (bitterly)
                         I s'pose that Swede's your idea of a 
                         hero.

                                     EASTERNER
                         He was the only brave man here 
                         tonight.

                                     SCULLY
                         Brave? Him?

                                     COWBOY
                         Him? His knees was knockin'!

               CLOSE SHOT -- EASTERNER

                                     EASTERNER
                              (new realizations 
                              breaking open)
                         Sure; he was scared sick. My bet is, 
                         he's been sick all his life, with 
                         cowardice. What a living hell! But I 
                         guess he reached his limit too. He 
                         stood up to it tonight -- worse fear 
                         than we'll ever dream of. And beat 
                         it too -- sure as he beat up Johnnie. 
                         Yes Mr. Scully, he's my idea of a 
                         hero. And whatever becomes of him 
                         now, it's our fault as much as his.

                                     COWBOY'S VOICE
                              (o.s.)
                         Our fault! Why, that feller's just...

                                     EASTERNER
                              (catching fire more)
                         Certainly our fault. Good heavens, 
                         we flatter ourselves we're civilized 
                         men... fit to cope with Destiny, 
                         Fate, the Devil Himself. And we come 
                         up against some puzzling minor 
                         disturbance like this Swede, and all 
                         we can do is the worst that's in us.
                              (a strange, almost 
                              clairvoyant bitterness)
                         Oh, we declared ourselves, all 
                         right... as sure as that blue-legged 
                         heron! Yes indeed! We made him what 
                         he's become tonight. We're the ones 
                         who've put him in danger!

                                     SCULLY'S VOICE
                              (o.s.; bewildered 
                              scorn)
                         Talk sense, man! Danger!

                                     EASTERNER
                         Look here. Any man is in danger who 
                         has spent a lifetime in fear and 
                         humiliation, and then suddenly finds 
                         his right to be alive. He's a danger 
                         to others, too. He doesn't know any 
                         better yet how to handle his power, 
                         than a child with a loaded gun.

               He studies their baffled, hostile faces with deep intensity 
               as the CAMERA PULLS AWAY into a CLOSE THREE SHOT and, with 
               almost a snarl of impatience over having delayed too long 
               and uselessly, reaches down for his bag. Scully's hand detains 
               him.

                                     SCULLY
                         Just a minute, you: Johnnie's goin' 
                         to have a fair hearin'.

                                     EASTERNER
                         Oh by all means for Johnnie! But 
                         don't waste my time with it. I've...

               o.s. SOUND of the dining room door opening. Instantly they 
               all become very still and look toward it.

               MEDIUM LONG SHOT -- JOHNNIE -- NEUTRAL ANGLE

               He limps toward them, washed, but cut and bruised; partly 
               undressed; on his way to bed. As he comes nearer the CAMERA 
               SWINGS to bring in the other three, MEDIUM CLOSE, favoring 
               Scully.

                                     SCULLY
                              (quietly)
                         Johnnie...

                                     JOHNNIE
                         H'lo, Pop.
                              (to the others, with 
                              a sad, brave smile 
                              as he starts past)
                         'Night.

                                     SCULLY
                              (gravely)
                         Johnnie...

               His tone makes Johnnie stop.

               CLOSE THREE SHOT -- EASTERNER, COWBOY, SCULLY -- FAVORING 
               SCULLY

                                     SCULLY
                              (quietly)
                         Mr. Blanc has something to say to 
                         you.

               CLOSE TWO SHOT -- JOHNNIE -- PAST SCULLY

               Cutting across the foregoing line.

               There is a cold, lightning-like spasm in Johnnie's eyes. 
               Then he is friendly, tired, ingenuous.

                                     JOHNNIE
                         Leavin' us, Mister?

               CLOSE GROUP SHOT -- FAVORING JOHNNIE AND EASTERNER

               The others watch them closely, but watch the Easterner sharper 
               than Johnnie.

                                     JOHNNIE
                              (likably)
                         Well what's up?

                                     EASTERNER
                              (very quiet)
                         You cheated, Johnnie.

                                     JOHNNIE
                              (smiling incredulously)
                         What's that?

                                     EASTERNER
                         I said, you cheated. I saw you.

               Johnnie looks at him very hard for a moment; then to Scully 
               and the Cowboy, with the smile of a tired good-guy.

                                     JOHNNIE
                              (to Scully and Cowboy)
                         What is this, a joke?

               They are silent.

                                     JOHNNIE
                              (dignified, quiet and 
                              reasonable)
                         You must of made a big mistake, 
                         Mister; 'cause I don't cheat.

                                     SCULLY
                              (with pathetic 
                              eagerness)
                         Now how about that, Sir!

                                     COWBOY
                              (forgivingly)
                         Anybody can make a mistake.

               For several seconds Johnnie and the Easterner look hard and 
               quietly at each other. Then the Easterner turns to Scully, 
               again extending the coins.

                                     EASTERNER
                              (not unkindly)
                         I owe you this, Mr. Scully.

               Johnnie surges toward him but is restrained with curious 
               ease by the Cowboy and Scully.

                                     SCULLY
                         Now none o' that, son. There's been 
                         enough o' that.

                                     EASTERNER
                              (to Scully)
                         You won't take it?

               There is no answer from Scully.

                                     EASTERNER
                         Well I can't keep it.

               He quietly lays the coins on the floor at Scully's feet. 
               Then he wipes the coin-sweat from his palms onto his coat 
               and picks up his bag.

                                     EASTERNER
                              (on a queer, wild 
                              impulse)
                         I'm sorry it isn't thirty pieces of 
                         silver.

               He turns and walks away toward the door and out of the shot. 
               They watch after him. The Cowboy is utterly baffled by his 
               remark but Scully calls after him bitterly.

                                     SCULLY
                         So now he's sacred into the bargain!

               MEDIUM SHOT -- EASTERNER -- FROM THEIR VIEWPOINT

               This shot cuts across Scully's line. The Easterner is still 
               walking away from the CAMERA toward the front door. He stops 
               and turns, looking from man to man and, at one moment, 
               directly into the lens.

                                     EASTERNER
                              (quietly)
                         Sacred enough; he's my conscience. 
                         Yours too, if you only knew it.

               He turns away and goes out the front door.

               MEDIUM THREE SHOT -- SCULLY, JOHNNIE, COWBOY

               o.s. SOUND of the closing door. They watch after him. A 
               silence.

                                     JOHNNIE
                              (quietly)
                         Matter with that guy? Gone crazy?

               No answer.

                                     SCULLY
                              (even more quietly)
                         We can't let him shpread it all over 
                         town.

               While the others start for their coats he squats and, with 
               sad dignity, starts to pick up the coins. ON HIM, as he does 
               so, SWIFTLY IRIS OUT.

               MEDIUM SHOT -- SWEDE -- A STREET CORNER (NITE)

               He emerges from almost pitch darkness into faint visibility, 
               into MEDIUM CLOSE UP, looking right and left as he comes to 
               the new intersection. His face lights up and he stops in his 
               tracks. He is still transcendent, but much more tired than 
               before.

               The CAMERA wrenches through an almost 120-degree, streaking 
               turn to the left of him, and stops as abruptly as it started. 
               Slant-wise down the side street, fairly distant, there is a 
               blur of light through furious snow. A dim sign reads BAR or 
               SALOON.

               CLOSE SHOT -- SWEDE

               With a weary, grateful air of seeing home at last, he sets 
               down his valise. Then he bends over deep-below-screen and 
               straightens up again and his hands are full of snow, with 
               which, with great simplicity and infinite refreshment, he 
               washes his cut face and hands. Then he flicks and shakes the 
               wet from his hands, lifts his cap with one hand and rakes 
               his other hand through his hair, replaces his cap and, his 
               face alight with anticipation and new hope, almost with love, 
               picks up his valise, and bevels off toward the light in a 
               rigid oblique, regardless of drifts, the sidewalk, etc.; the 
               CAMERA SWINGING to center on his plodding back.

                                                                QUICK FADE:

               FADE IN:

               INT. MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- THE BAR -- FOUR MEN AT A TABLE 
               (NITE)

               It is a clean, well-lighted place; not big. A table at the 
               rear; four men at it: a lawyer, a doctor, a merchant and a 
               gambler.

               We shoot past the Gambler's left shoulder, MEDIUM CLOSE, on 
               the Doctor at our left; the Lawyer facing toward the front 
               of bar, the Merchant on our right. It is self-evident by 
               their looks that the three we can see are among the most 
               respectable and well-to-do men in town. Smoothest of all is 
               the Lawyer. Of the Gambler we see nothing yet except the 
               shoulder of his coat and perhaps a rather fine hand with a 
               wedding ring on it, and a soberly-jewel-linked cuff, and a 
               sleeve of a suit as sober as the others, except it is an 
               elegant dove-gray. They are all smoking cigars, and there 
               are drinks on the table. The Lawyer is doing all of the 
               talking, quietly, smoothly and earnestly; looking always 
               directly into the Gambler's eyes. We soon realize he is the 
               spokesman for the rest, by the way the Doctor gazes into the 
               table, nodding now and then, and the Merchant gazes at the 
               Lawyer, nodding more often and more sensitively; and by what 
               he is saying.

                                     LAWYER
                         Of course we hardly need to tell 
                         you, Sir, how deeply we regret it: 
                         Even those of us who voted against 
                         you on principle... and it is in our 
                         honorableness and candor due a friend 
                         that I tell you that I was one of 
                         them...
                              (the Merchant is deeply 
                              moved by admiration 
                              for all this)
                         ...even we regretted it most 
                         painfully, perhaps most painfully of 
                         all if I may say so. After all, every 
                         responsible person in Fort Romper, 
                         every self-respecting man in this 
                         part of the State, knows you as a 
                         square gambler. You have never yet 
                         been known to take advantage of any 
                         man who didn't, in every sensible 
                         person's... uh... in the opinion of 
                         every sensible person, richly deserve 
                         it, one might say "ask for it". Your 
                         family life is exemplary. Your 
                         companionship is a pleasure which 
                         all of us hope to share for many 
                         years to come
                              (even more earnestly 
                              and gently)
                         But we do hope you understand, Sir. 
                         After all,
                              (his voice all but 
                              cracks with 
                              earnestness)
                         the Pollywog Club is a pleasure club. 
                         Oh, stakes, perhaps modest stakes, 
                         but among amateurs as it were;
                              (a feeble would-be-
                              charming smile)
                         greenhorns. Of course there isn't a 
                         single member of our little club who 
                         could imagine that you would ever... 
                         ever, well, as it were, uh, well, 
                         violate, uh, take advantage of...
                              (by now he is 
                              thoroughly miserable)
                         ...I do hope you understand me, Sir.
                              (the invisible man 
                              just lets him fry)
                         But a professional gambler, after 
                         all. It's just the principle of the 
                         thing you know. The ap... the 
                         appearance of the thing. No personal 
                         offense in the world.
                              (pause; no help from 
                              the Gambler)
                              (miserably but with 
                              dignity)
                         I do only hope you understand me, 
                         Sir, how very deeply embarrassing 
                         this is for me... for all of us. How 
                         very deeply we regret it.

               They wait, eyes as before. A medium pause.

                                     GAMBLER'S VOICE
                              (o.s.; an even 
                              smoother, gentler 
                              voice, whose icy 
                              central irony totally 
                              escapes them)
                         My dear sir: friends: I wish I might 
                         have saved you this painful 
                         embarrassment. It is because I honor 
                         you as gentlemen and as friends that 
                         I know that you must meet me with 
                         candor, however painful that might 
                         be for you. I am deeply grateful for 
                         that candor. Allow me to meet you 
                         with equal candor. I think I need 
                         say only this: If I were a member of 
                         the Pollywog Club, and my own name 
                         or that of any other professional 
                         gambler were brought to a vote, I 
                         would have acted precisely as you 
                         have done, for precisely the same 
                         reasons, and with precisely the same 
                         sentiments, before, during, and after. 
                         In a word, I would have blackballed 
                         myself from the Pollywog without a 
                         second thought.

               During this speech the Doctor and the Merchant have turned 
               their eyes slowly to him in wonder and almost in unbelief, 
               and the Lawyer's eyes have stayed on his, burning with a 
               steadily increasing light of deep emotion. By the end of it 
               they are all looking at him practically as if he were Jesus 
               and could cook into the bargain.

               The Lawyer's eyes are brimming; he clears his throat but he 
               can't speak yet; the Merchant looks at him and now his eyes 
               brim too. At last the Lawyer rises (the others hurriedly 
               following suit) with his glass.

                                     LAWYER
                              (all choked up; very 
                              quietly)
                         Let us stand, my friends, and drink: 
                         to a gentleman!

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- THE GAMBLER

               As he rises quickly; he is elegant, histrionic; quietly 
               dignified, cold as ice.

                                     GAMBLER
                              (with a slight bow)
                         To you: gentlemen: and my good 
                         friends.

               They all touch glasses and drink with their respective ideas 
               of 18th century elegance. The Merchant, overwhelmed with 
               emotion, clearly has the sudden idea of smashing his glass 
               and makes the start of a gesture toward that end.

                                     BARKEEPER'S VOICE
                              (o.s., gently but 
                              alarmed)
                         Hey -- Hey!

               The Merchant shrivels up with humiliation like a spider in a 
               flame; the Gambler's amused delight is beautifully concealed. 
               He doesn't look around at the barkeeper, but modestly at the 
               table. Both others glance sharply at the barkeeper.

               MEDIUM SHOT -- BARKEEPER

               From their angle, about halfway up the bar. His forehead is 
               still wrinkled with dismay; he is awfully embarrassed to 
               have spoken so sharp to such respectable folks.

                                     BARKEEPER
                              (in a low voice)
                         'Scuse me, folks, it just slipped 
                         out.

               CLOSE GROUP SHOT

               Between the Lawyer and the Doctor, on the Merchant and the 
               Gambler. The Lawyer, by his slight stiff turn of head away 
               from the Barkeeper, does not even deign to grant him pardon. 
               The Gambler is very quiet; an almost tenderly sympathetic 
               smile behind which he is reveling in a cruel delight of ironic 
               amusement. The Doctor's head rugged and quiet, a little more 
               scraggy looking than before. The Merchant, crumpled with 
               embarrassment, is just carefully setting down his glass. The 
               Lawyer saves the situation virtually unimpaired by bowing 
               slightly and formally to the Gambler, who returns it to the 
               table at large; the Doctor bows, and the Merchant, a trifle 
               late; as they sit down, the Lawyer gently, manfully claps 
               the Merchant on the shoulder; a glance from the Merchant of 
               spaniel-like gratitude. Their noble mood is addled but not 
               utterly destroyed: they seek to repair it. By the Gambler's 
               smile we know exactly the smile, from the Lawyer, which 
               elicited it; the Merchant is trying to smile too when there 
               is the o.s. SOUND of the front door opening and a stamping 
               in the vestibule between the street door and the swinging 
               doors: all glance toward the door except the Gambler, who 
               watches the Lawyer.

               LONG SHOT -- THE FRONT DOOR

               Top rim of the bar in r.s. The rim of the bar is exactly 
               level in perspective and sprouts from exact center of the 
               right edge of the screen. An almost instantaneous shot as 
               the Swede starts coming through the swinging doors.

               CLOSE SHOT -- SWEDE

               At head height, as he comes through. He is as high and glowing 
               as before, though slightly less wild; the sudden warmth hits 
               him like a shock of peace and good prospect; his face softens 
               and swells; his eyes flick the joint. Again a very brief 
               shot; he is stepping forward.

               LONG SHOT -- THE TABLE

               Faces and eyes just at the end of casually looking at him; 
               resuming their private conversation. This shot is as quick 
               as a glance.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- BARKEEPER

               At his station near mid-bar. Eyes quick from the table to 
               the Swede, a quick size-up; underplayed and, again, as quick 
               as a glance.

               CLOSE SHOT -- DOWN ON THE SWEDE'S VALISE AND RIGHT FOOT

               He plants his right shoe on the rail; it is clogged with 
               snow; he stomps and scrapes rather loudly, trying to clear 
               it.

               MEDIUM LONG SHOT -- THE TABLE

               Quick, gentlemanly glances of annoyed wondering what it is, 
               finding out, gentlemanly ignoring of the boorishness; back 
               to their muttons.

               CLOSE SHOT -- BARKEEPER

               A sharp little glance toward the table and toward the noise; 
               annoyance; a tinge of refinement.

               CLOSE DOWN SHOT -- VALISE AND FOOT

               The Swede gets his foot hung comfortably.

               CLOSE SHOT -- THE SWEDE

               He settles his elbows at the bar. He is tired, almost sleepy 
               with the sudden warmth; glowing like a stove; still on top 
               of the world but becoming very peaceful.

                                     SWEDE
                              (eyes to Barkeeper)
                         Gimme some whiskey, will you?

               The Barkeeper walks quietly into the shot with a high-grade 
               Bartender's faintly insolent politeness toward a low-grade 
               customer; he plants a bottle on the bar, a whiskey glass, 
               and a glass of ice-thick water.

               The Swede pours himself an abnormal portion and drinks it 
               down in three gulps. While the Swede pours and gulps, the 
               Barkeeper, past him, pretty close in the shot, is making the 
               pretension of blindness which is the distinction of his class, 
               but it can be seen that he is furtively studying the 
               halfraised bloodstains on the Swede's face.

                                     BARKEEPER
                              (indifferently)
                         Pretty bad night.

               No answer.

                                     BARKEEPER
                         Bad night.
                              (his meaning is clearly 
                              double and quietly 
                              discourteous: bad 
                              night for you, bud, 
                              that's clear enough)

                                     SWEDE
                              (pouring more whiskey)
                         Oh, it's good enough for me.

               He roots under his coat and deep into his britches-pocket, 
               slaps down a coin, and tosses off the new drink, eyes 
               following the Barkeeper.

               MEDIUM SHOT -- BARKEEPER -- FROM SWEDE'S ANGLE

               Putting the coin through a highly-nickeled cash register 
               with a brilliant clanging of the bell.

               CLOSER SHOT -- SWEDE

               As he finishes his second drink; he is heavier now yet still 
               tremendously elated and at peace with himself: he pivots 
               eyes and head in a slow benign sweep down the bar and in the 
               direction of the table, looking toward the men, o. s., with 
               towering benign vanity and self-confidence, and friendly 
               interest. SOUND o.s., of a coin slapped on the bar, rouses 
               him from this boozy musing.

               CAMERA "adjusts" about as heavily and clumsily as the Swede 
               does, to get the Barkeeper into the shot.

                                     SWEDE
                              (a wave of the hand)
                         Keep it, keep it.

                                     BARKEEPER
                              (with a tinge of 
                              sarcasm; the change 
                              is only a nickel)
                         Thank you sir.

                                     SWEDE
                              (grandly; abstractedly)
                         Buy yourself a cigar.

               A pause.

               The Barkeeper is looking toward the table; the Swede at the 
               Barkeeper. The Swede is trying to cogitate. He's somewhat 
               disappointed; nothing is going as he had wildly imagined it 
               would go with people, from now on; but he has just enough 
               sense to realize: after all, this guy doesn't know me for 
               what I am. Better let him in on it a little.

                                     SWEDE
                         No, this isn't too bad weather. It's 
                         good enough for me.

                                     BARKEEPER
                              (languidly)
                         So?
                              (he drifts a foot or 
                              so away, down bar)

               The Swede is sweating a little; the booze is getting to him 
               now; his breathing is a little heavier.

                                     SWEDE
                         Yes, I like this weather. I like it.
                              (nodding heavy time 
                              to his words)
                         It suits me.

                                     BARKEEPER
                              (after a short pause)
                         So?
                              (he turns to study 
                              the bar mirror)

               Swede flinches, confused with disappointment and uncertain 
               what to try next, follows his eye along and down the mirror.

               CLOSE SHOT -- SWEDE'S REFLECTION IN BAR MIRROR

               Eyes glittering in the scrolled mirror, o.s. SOUND of his 
               heavy breathing. After a few moments of this mirror-gazing, 
               the mirror blurs a little and comes as if effortlessly back 
               into focus; blurs again:

               CLOSE SHOT -- SWEDE FROM ANGLE OF HIS REFLECTION

               He squeezes his eyes tight shut and opens them; his head is 
               lower than when we saw it before; he is leaning deep and 
               heavy on his elbows. Evidently triumph, melancholy, fatigue, 
               loneliness, the dismay and disappointment of a dream 
               confronting actuality, all balled up in him, not to mention 
               the whiskey and the warmth, are all hard at work in him, 
               with all the liabilities a little outweighing. It is in the 
               need for counterbalance that he speaks next.

                                     SWEDE
                         Well, I guess I'll have another drink.
                              (he pours, a heavier 
                              slug than before but 
                              slower and, raising 
                              his glass, needing 
                              company bad but trying 
                              to make it seem 
                              casual, he eyes 
                              Barkeeper o.s.)
                         Have something?

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- BARKEEPER PAST SWEDE

                                     BARKEEPER
                         No, thanks, I'm not drinking.

               The Swede downs his drink fast but a little more doggedly 
               than before; no real relish for it; while the Barkeeper 
               studies him more openly.

                                     BARKEEPER
                         How'd you hurt your face?
                              (a tinge of mild insult 
                              which the Swede misses)

                                     SWEDE
                              (loud and blustery; 
                              grateful for the 
                              chance)
                         Why, in a fight. I thumped the soul 
                         out of a man down here at Scully's 
                         hotel.

                                     LAWYER'S VOICE
                              (o.s.)
                         Who was it?

               Swede turns quickly.

               MEDIUM LONG SHOT -- TABLE FROM SWEDE'S ANGLE

               They are all looking at him.

               CLOSE SHOT -- SWEDE -- FROM SAME ANGLE -- BARKEEPER IN B.G.

                                     SWEDE
                         Johnnie Scully. Son of the man what 
                         runs it.

               MEDIUM LONG SHOT -- TABLE FROM SWEDE'S ANGLE

               Their reaction is not one of overjoy.

               MEDIUM CLOSE -- SWEDE

               Seeing they are not as impressed as he is, he tries to better 
               it by making it bigger. He is beginning to squint as if seeing 
               them through a needle eye.

                                     SWEDE
                         He'll be pretty near dead for some 
                         weeks, I can tell you.

               Again he waits a reaction.

               MEDIUM SHOT -- SAME ANGLE

                                     SWEDE
                              (talking a little 
                              louder)
                         I made a nice thing of him, I did. 
                         He couldn't get up. They...

               MEDIUM LONG SHOT -- SWEDE -- FROM ANGLE OF TABLE

                                     SWEDE
                              (continuing)
                         ...had to carry him in the house. 
                         Have a drink?

               LONG SHOT -- ON TABLE FROM BEHIND BAR -- PAST SWEDE'S HEAD

               The men at the table have in some subtle way encased 
               themselves in reserve.

                                     LAWYER
                              (voice neither pleasant 
                              nor unpleasant)
                         No thanks.

               Now none of them look at the Swede. The Swede keeps looking 
               at them. A couple of seconds after the "no thanks" he turns 
               his face into the shot, disappointed, mixed-up and a little 
               sore.

                                     SWEDE
                              (to Barkeeper)
                         Come on, have a drink.
                              (he grabs the bottle 
                              and holds it out)

               CAMERA SWINGS losing table and bringing in Barkeeper.

                                     BARKEEPER
                              (shakes his head)

                                     SWEDE
                         What... No? Well, have a little one 
                         then.
                              (thick fingers measure 
                              a little one)
                         By Golly, I've whipped a man tonight, 
                         and I want to celebrate. Whipped him 
                         good too.
                              (he turns his head 
                              suddenly again into 
                              hindside close up of 
                              his face. Calls loudly)
                         Gentlemen, have a drink?

                                     BARKEEPER
                         Ssh!

               The table is back in the shot now; only a fragment of the 
               Barkeeper as in the start of the shot.

               The Doctor looks up.

                                     DOCTOR
                              (curtly)
                         Thanks. We don't want any more.

               They all conspicuously pay "no attention" to the Swede.

               CLOSE SHOT -- SWEDE -- FROM ANGLE OF TABLE

               The Swede is still looking toward the table, sore as a boil; 
               he ruffles up like a rooster, and explodes.

                                     SWEDE
                              (loudly, wavering in 
                              his speech between 
                              Barkeeper and table)
                         Well, it seems I can't get any one 
                         to drink with me in this town. Seems 
                         so, don't it? Well!

                                     BARKEEPER
                         Ssshhh!

                                     SWEDE
                              (leaning toward him, 
                              snarling)
                         Say, don't you try to shush me up. I 
                         won't have it. I'm a gentleman, and 
                         I want people to drink with me. And 
                         I want um to drink with me now.
                              (hard fist on the bar)
                         NOW! You understand?

                                     BARKEEPER
                              (callous and sulky)
                         I hear you.

                                     SWEDE
                              (louder)
                         Well, listen hard then. See those 
                         men over there?
                              (he flings out a thick 
                              arm)
                         Well, they're gonna drink with me 
                         and don't you forget it! Now you 
                         watch!

                                     BARKEEPER
                         Hey! This won't do!

                                     SWEDE
                              (already walking; 
                              chops out the words.)
                         Why won't it?

               CAMERA is with the Swede, along his right side as he walks. 
               He is in pretty large CLOSE UP, filling the right half of 
               the screen, his angry profile almost pushing the right edge 
               of it; the bar streaking past in left half and the Barkeeper 
               hesitantly hurrying, as he walks fast and drunkenly up to 
               the table. Just as he comes up, lower CAMERA a little to his 
               outlifting hand and speed its SWING a little to bring in a 
               flash of the men at the table, not getting up, but tightening 
               in their chairs.

               CLOSE SHOT -- SWEDE'S HAND

               In a heavy combination of a clap and a fall, hits the gray 
               shoulder of the man who happens to be nearest him -- the 
               Gambler's.

               CLOSE UP -- THE GAMBLER -- FROM SWEDE'S VIEWPOINT

               A diminutive man, twists his head slowly and looks up into 
               the Swede's eyes. From this angle he is all eyes and forehead; 
               the chin looks weak.

               STEEP CLOSE UP -- SWEDE -- FROM GAMBLER'S ANGLE

               From this angle he is all truculent jaw and mouth, little 
               glittering eyes above; apishly small upper half of head.

                                     SWEDE
                              (wrathfully)
                         How about this? I asked you to drink 
                         with me.
                              (his eyes flick sorely 
                              and quickly toward 
                              the others)

               DOWN SHOT -- ON LAWYER AND MERCHANT -- PAST SWEDE AND GAMBLER

               Keeping their seats; looking at the Swede in icy disgust.

                                     GAMBLER
                              (coolly; somewhat 
                              melodiously)
                         My friend, I don't know you.

                                     SWEDE
                              (roughly; trying to 
                              smile and be his 
                              idea of "Western" 
                              about non-
                              introductions)
                         Ahh, come on and have a drink!

               CLOSE SHOT -- DOCTOR, MERCHANT, LAWYER

               All eyes to the Swede, all registering their respective kinds 
               of well-bred silence

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- BARKEEPER

               Opposite the table, behind his bar; sprung like a ready 
               trigger; watching everyone very carefully.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- GAMBLER AND SWEDE

               Gambler very low in screen, the Swede very high, past the 
               Doctor in f.g.

                                     GAMBLER
                              (face still up-turned; 
                              coolly and with mock-
                              kindness but very 
                              firm; very much the 
                              gentleman)
                         Now, my boy, take your hand off my 
                         shoulder and go 'way and mind your 
                         own business.

               ZOOM CAMERA TO EXTREME CLOSE UP OF SWEDE, slanting up at him 
               a little.

                                     SWEDE
                         What! You won't drink with me, you 
                         little dude? I'll make you then! 
                         I'll make you!

               On the first "I'll make you" he is rapidly stooping; STREAK 
               CAMERA DOWN TO EXTREME CLOSE UP of his hands and the Gambler's 
               face; the hands are already grabbing him by the throat and 
               dragging him from his chair, over noise of scraped-back chairs 
               and rising ad libs of Hey! stop! Great Scott! Stop him!

               CUT OVER THESE SOUNDS AND WORDS MEDIUM SHOT -- THE GROUP

               Past the three men at the table, centering on the Gambler 
               and the Swede, (SOUND of running Barkeeper and his ad libbing 
               o.s.). The three men are rising in their far from rough or 
               halfway ready way, to help; but everything is too fast for 
               them. The Gambler almost instantly stops resisting the upward 
               drag and gets up, throwing the Swede off balance; pivoting 
               as he rises so that he drives the Swede behind the chair 
               toward the wall opposite the bar; getting under the Swede's 
               clumsily placed elbows with his whole left arm and shoulder 
               and lifting as he rises so that the Swede's whole slick and 
               shiny chest and belly of leather coat bulges taut, swollen 
               and shiny as a watermelon, catching highlight from the bar 
               light. Just while it can still be visible before the pivoting 
               hides it, he reaches deftly into his trouser pocket and pulls 
               out something; the snap of a spring and a long blade flicks 
               out, flashing the same highlight we have just seen on the 
               Swede's soft belly. SOUNDS of breath drawn in sharp with 
               horror. The Gambler's arm straightens back, drives forward; 
               a horrifying SOUND as the blade enters the leather (on far 
               side of fighters from us), and a deep weird groaning grunt 
               from the Swede.

               CLOSE UP -- SWEDE

               Almost a head taller than the Gambler, whose back is to the 
               shot. The Swede's eyes and mouth are amazingly wide: pain in 
               them, but far more, supreme astonishment: childlike.

               Low in the shot the Gambler, not too easily, (SOUND o.s.) 
               extracts the knife and vanishes out of the shot to the left 
               (we don't see his face) as CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSER ON THE 
               SWEDE.

               The Swede is drawing as deep a breath as his lungs can hold; 
               eyes and mouth are now even more wide and amazed; then, very 
               long and slow and gentle, incredulous, downward-trailing to 
               a damp breath, he utters the Swedish word for "no," which is 
               "nej," pronounced 'nay,' in a tone almost beyond sorrow and 
               wonder but partaking of both: he begins to step backward 
               very slowly, CAMERA gently and implacably following, and 
               gaining on him a little, very gradually; and still more slowly 
               to sink; CAMERA ditto: at the end of the "Nay" his chin 
               trembles a little, the staring eyes alter, one tear runs out 
               of each:

               As the two tears spring out, a SWIFT THRUST OF CAMERA up to 
               the eyes -- not too close;

                                                              THEN CUTTING:

               NOT DISSOLVING:

               and with great rapidity: The supersonic tone used pianissimo 
               at first and steadily increasing to ultimate unbearable 
               intensity, behind all the shots: likewise a subsonic tone, 
               same intensification.

               In a huge soft radiant CLOSE UP involving munificent crystal 
               and mahogany and a spray of potted palmleaves, over distant 
               male cheers and discreet streaming SOUNDS of high grade dinner 
               music, the Swede and the Gambler, in soup and fish, touch 
               glasses, smiling, courtly; in b.g., the vague-focused heads 
               of the three other men raise glasses; superimposed for a 
               fraction of the time it takes him to say it, the Barkeeper 
               in smiling CLOSE UP saying, "It's on the house, gentlemen."

               Over brass disc of music of suppertime, very faint, Scully, 
               Easterner, Cowboy rush to congratulate him by his tree just 
               after the fight.

               Over same music, indoors by the stove, Johnnie, battered and 
               sheepish, nods and grins as he lifts the Swede's hand as the 
               victor's.

               Over same music, a little louder, Swede in CLOSE UP, his arm 
               around Johnnie's shoulders, both faces beaten up, both 
               grinning as Scully, grinning, in l.s., offers the yellow-
               brown whiskey bottle.

               Over the SOUND of transcontinental express, an unknown good 
               looking well-bred blonde woman of a ripe thirty-five loses a 
               look of hauteur and smiles up at him promisingly.

               Over train and disc music a whole parlorfull of floozies in 
               negligee hasten, happily, to swarm around an advancing CAMERA.

               A fearsome heavily-mustached blond man in clothes of lower 
               middle-class Sweden (circa 1860, -- his father), glaring 
               down into the lens over the SOUND of whipping and child's 
               crying, suddenly smiles beautifully and benignly: total 
               approval and respect as eyes and lens lift and come level: 
               no whipping SOUND: then scowls again.

               The immense vague tender face of a young woman, shot from 
               the angle and nearness of a baby looking up from the crook 
               of her elbow; over the SOUND of a warm untrained contralto 
               half-humming a lullaby or folksong in a foreign language, 
               she gazes with infinite tenderness and pity into the lens.

               SOUND of impact of a tremendous blow, exploding 398-H into a 
               white flash and recovering into a close image of Johnnie 
               past his still landing fist.

               Easterner, from earlier, his mouth saying, "I don't understand 
               you": but silent.

               From the Swede's viewpoint: Johnnie does something shady 
               with the cards.

               A long line of hard men in a dark bar look up rather 
               dangerously at the advancing CAMERA over the SOUND of swinging 
               doors.

               CLOSE detail-shot of "The Stag at Bay," very dark. (The 
               HIGHSOUND is by now very strong; no other SOUNDS.) Then SOUND 
               of child's crying o.s.

               A little boy pulverizing the face of another little boy who 
               is crying and not hitting back. LOUDEN SOUND of child's 
               crying; begin lullaby.

               Face of the Father, closer and fiercer: same SOUNDS.

               Swede in EXTREME CLOSE UP at the corner of the town in fullest 
               magnificence. He is not shouting but add the SOUND of his 
               shout, at a great distance, to the other SOUNDS.

               The tigerish reflection in the mirror; continue shout and 
               other SOUNDS.

               Same small boy alone, face beaten, crying: SOUND of crying.

               Again the huge vague maternal face: silent except for HIGH 
               SOUND which is now at its peak!

               EXTREME CLOSE UP -- SWEDE

               His mouth is almost closed now, his eyes are still wide; he 
               slowly, mournfully, wags his head once to and fro as he sinks: 
               the eyes again alter and slowly freeze into an expression of 
               unutterable horror, dread, recognition and grief. The film, 
               with this change in eyes, very gradually darkens, by darker 
               printing: the eyes remain fixed on the same o.s. spot, just 
               off lens, and it is as if they now die and the rest of him 
               is merely trailing them. CAMERA stops following him: he backs 
               against the edge of a little side table; gropes backward 
               with one hand; fumbles backward between two of the small 
               tables which line the wall and backs between them to the 
               bench and slowly lets himself down and, within a second more, 
               is still. After a second of this stillness (make it a stop 
               shot and stop the HIGH and LOW SOUNDS) his eyes are still 
               fixed on the same spot.

               MEDIUM LONG SHOT -- THE GROUP

               The Swede is just out of the shot beyond r.s. The Gambler 
               stands just where we left him; his knife, point downward is 
               still in his hand. Only the Doctor moves. After perhaps three 
               seconds of immobility he comes through his friends and past 
               the Gambler and over to the Swede, CAMERA SWINGING with him, 
               SOUND of his shoes very quietly crackling on the sanded floor. 
               When he gets to the Swede he stands sufficiently between us 
               and the Swede that we can't see what he's doing, but it isn't 
               much -- no need for it to be. Then he straightens up and 
               turns, with desperate eyes, and goes back past the Gambler 
               and his friends, CAMERA SWINGING, same quiet, sandy SOUNDS, 
               and gets his coat. As he lifts it from the coatrack.

                                     MERCHANT
                              (softly)
                         O my Gahhd-uh. O my Gahhhd-uh.

               He turns and starts toward his coat and stumbles against a 
               chair as if he were blind. The Lawyer reaches out swiftly, 
               as to catch him should he fall; he doesn't; the Lawyer gently 
               pushes-helps him to the coatrack, a hand against his nearest 
               upper arm; they start getting on their coats. The Lawyer is 
               quick, the Merchant clumsy as a child; the Lawyer helps him; 
               the Doctor, all set, starts toward the front door.

               MEDIUM SHOT -- GAMBLER

               He faces the bar squarely (the Swede is not in the b.g.). He 
               is standing very straight and graceful, almost military, 
               facing the CAMERA, looking to l.s. He is managing this with 
               terrific effort and his knees are just visibly trembling. 
               SOUND of the Doctor's footsteps; the Gambler's eyes moving 
               steadily with him: he comes across close, l.s. to r.s.; the 
               Gambler's eyes on his. The Doctor doesn't look at him; he is 
               so scrawny and rugged with shock and distress he looks sick 
               and ten years older. He crosses the shot and out. The 
               Gambler's eyes very quietly to l.s. again: 3 flicks of his 
               eyes, to height of the Lawyer, the Merchant and then the 
               Lawyer again, swinging with them. They enter and cross the 
               shot, side by side; the Merchant on the far side of the Lawyer 
               and almost totally obscured by him.

                                     MERCHANT
                              (half-moaning)
                         O my Gaaahhhdd-uh, my Gaaahhdd-uh.

               He says this about every five seconds from the time he starts 
               to his exit, ever more moistly, softly, calflike, never 
               louder. The Lawyer's head, close, high in screen, is desperate 
               icy granite, noble Roman; his eyes, which look straight 
               forward, unseeing as a statue's. The Gambler's eyes follow 
               as they exit right screen.

               LONG SHOT -- THE FRONT DOOR

               The rim of the bar in the middle of the edge of r.s., and 
               level in perspective. The Lawyer very erect, an arm across 
               the Merchant's shoulders; the Merchant caved in and stumbling 
               as a widow. Now they either just avoid stumbling, or stumble 
               brutally against, the Swede's valise; then on, not looking 
               back, and out the door.

               MEDIUM SHOT -- THE GAMBLER

               SOUND of closing door. Very slowly he lifts his knife and 
               looks at it. Again by terrific effort he brings the trembling 
               of the blade down to just perceptible. After a long pause he 
               lifts his eyes toward the Barkeeper, o.s.

                                     GAMBLER
                              (very quietly)
                         May I have your bar-cloth, please.

               MEDIUM SHOT -- BARKEEPER

                                     BARKEEPER
                              (limply; almost 
                              inaudibly)
                         Yes, sir.

               He walks unsteadily up the bar for the cloth, toward the 
               edge of the shot, while the Gambler walks even more slowly 
               to the bar; his back, like his front, expressive of terrific 
               shock and incredible control.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- GAMBLER AND BARKEEPER

               As they converge at the bar, Barkeeper extends the cloth 
               delicately and the Gambler takes it as delicately. Gambler 
               nods thank you. The Gambler wipes his blade and as he does 
               that his hands and knees start trembling badly in spite of 
               himself. With an almost suicidal effort he controls the 
               trembling and makes the faintest beginning of handing the 
               cloth back to the Barkeeper, who winces very faintly; then, 
               reaching carefully rather than tossing, he puts the cloth on 
               the bar. He folds his knife and puts it in his pocket.

                                     GAMBLER
                              (in an unearthly calm, 
                              dry voice with a 
                              scratchiness 
                              underneath)
                         Charlie, you tell 'em where to find 
                         me. I'll be home, waiting for 'em.

               The Barkeeper tries to speak; he can't; he nods, then nods 
               again.

               The Gambler walks into the shot and past the CAMERA and 
               returns, within a couple of seconds, walking into the shot 
               and away, back-to; his hat is already on; as we first see 
               him he is finishing shrugging into and settling his overcoat; 
               and now, by faint motions of hands and elbows, as he 
               continues, we know he is buttoning it. It must be clear that 
               though he walks very erect, calm, and even, he is scarcely 
               able to stand up. He takes a long slanting line to avoid the 
               valise; rectifies the line the instant he passes it; and so 
               out the door. (Under all these exits use SOUND of feet on 
               sanded floor).

               The Barkeeper, who leaned back against the bar as the Gambler 
               went for his coat, stays there very still a moment after the 
               door shuts; then up the bar, knees wobbly, a hand on the bar 
               sustaining him now and then, to the bottle on the bar at the 
               Swede's place. He lifts the bottle and the Swede's glass, 
               puts down the glass and drinks from the bottle, deeply. The 
               inevitable violent reaction of a kind of writhing of his 
               whole interior; a kind of gobbling SOUND. Then a great HUH 
               expulsion of breath: then loud deep breathing, stunned eyes 
               wandering vacantly. Then we see that they must light on the 
               Swede, o.s., for they stop abruptly, and so does the 
               breathing. Then after a couple of seconds the breathing begins 
               again, great HUHS, but this time much more terrible shattering 
               with shock and with a kind of dry sobbing: an off-balance 
               pump: HUH -- uhhhhh: dead silence: HUH -- uhhhhh: dead 
               silence. He takes two almost sneaky steps toward the door; 
               hand reaching behind and untying his apron: then sprints 
               ungainly, his apron fouling legs and feet and kicked aside 
               as if it were a snake, with another awful HUH -- uuuhhh 
               carrying him at high speed through the door. No SOUND of 
               closing door, but SOUND of the scream of the storm, very far 
               down.

                                     BARKEEPER'S VOICE
                              (o.s.; retreating in 
                              the street and muffled 
                              in the storm, bawling, 
                              bestial)
                         Helllllp! Murrrrrder! Helllllp!

               HOLD SHOT ON BARE BAR and perspective of its rim, through 
               these lines.

               FULL SHOT -- THE WHOLE INTERIOR (ORTHOCHROMATIC FILM)

               A formal shot from the dead center of the front of the room: 
               a shot modeled on postcards of 1890-1910: our first full 
               view of the nicest bar in a small town: pathetic but not 
               completely unsuccessful in its efforts at a kind of barren 
               charm and grace. The sand on the floor in the f.g. is swept 
               in pretty curclicues; these are scuffed along the bar and 
               where the fight took place. HOLD three or four seconds, long 
               enough to register fully the Swede and the cash register, 
               dead-opposite each other, at exact middles of their sides of 
               the room. No storm SOUND: pure silence.

               EXTREME CLOSE UP -- THE SWEDE'S LEFT EYE (ORTHOCHROMATIC)

               Occupying the whole screen except enough to show a little of 
               a contused cheekbone and across it, a crooked rill of dried 
               blood and a snailtrack shining of a not yet dried tear. The 
               eye, if technically possible, is glazing as we watch. Silence.

               EXTREME CLOSE SHOT -- THE CASH REGISTER (ORTHOCHROMATIC)

               The ornate cast-iron top of the nickel-plated cash register. 
               Its florid shape recalls the florid cornice of the Blue Hotel. 
               The cash amount is below-screen. The stamped lettering of 
               the legend is fiercely cold, glittering, massive and hard -- 
               a little ornate like much of the lettering of the time:

                        THIS REGISTERS THE AMOUNT OF YOUR PURCHASE

               o.s. SOUND of a door opening. HOLD the shot a couple of 
               seconds after it.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               FADE IN:

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- THE EASTERNER

               As he comes through the swinging doors, advances a couple of 
               paces, and stops dead in his tracks as his eyes find the 
               Swede. An impulse to go to him is instantly arrested; it is 
               so clear that he is beyond help. Almost unconsciously, he 
               sets down his traveling bag. A freezing anguish of guilt 
               enters his still face.

               After a sufficient pause to make clear they did not come 
               with him, Scully, Johnnie and the Cowboy come in, quietly, 
               but winded. They also look, see, and are silent. They try to 
               subdue their breathing. They have left the street door open 
               and we can see that there is no more storm or SOUND outside.

               The Easterner is aware when they come in; we feel that he 
               even knows who they are. But throughout the scene, he never 
               shifts his eyes from the Swede; and they shift theirs only 
               rarely. Throughout, they stand behind Easterner.

               After a considerable silence:

                                     SCULLY
                              (in a subdued voice)
                         How did it happen?

               The Easterner says nothing. A pause.

                                     COWBOY
                              (quietly too)
                         You ask me, that feller was lookin' 
                         for trouble. An' he sure found himself 
                         a plenty.

               A pause.

                                     EASTERNER
                              (in a strange, vague 
                              voice)
                         Looking...?
                              (more firmly, but 
                              very quiet)
                         Like all troubled men.
                              (pause)
                         And we helped him find it, and we 
                         trapped him into it.

               A pause. The three men behind now glance at each other.

                                     SCULLY
                              (a little less subdued)
                         See here, Mister.

               The Easterner says nothing.

                                     SCULLY
                         Just one thing.

                                     EASTERNER
                              (quietly)
                         Go home.

                                     SCULLY
                         Just one little thing. Johnnie an' 
                         me live in this town. We don't want 
                         no stories shpread around that ye...

                                     EASTERNER
                              (as quietly)
                         Go home. Stop worrying. Tell whatever 
                         story you please.

                                     SCULLY
                         Ye mane ye -- ye won't...

                                     EASTERNER
                         Your conscience is your business. 
                         Each one of you. My own is enough 
                         for me to cope with.

               They linger, unsure and weary.

                                     EASTERNER
                              (with deep exhausted 
                              bitterness)
                         So just go home now. Leave me alone.
                              (pause)
                         If you please!

               A silence.

                                     SCULLY
                              (quietly and solemnly)
                         We didn't have no part in it.

               The three shake their heads, but they don't look at each 
               other.

                                     EASTERNER
                         Every sin is a collaboration. 
                         Everybody is responsible for 
                         everything.

               The three look unsurely at each other; they are obscurely 
               abashed.

                                     SCULLY
                              (with a slight gesture 
                              and an almost 
                              inaudible whisper)
                         Come on.

               Each looks a last time toward the Swede, each in his own 
               strange way, kind of gloomy, shy, foreboding reproach and 
               resentment; and each, one by one, turns away from the CAMERA 
               and walks quietly outdoors and out of the shot. We hear only 
               the SOUND of the faint squeaking of their shoes on snow, and 
               soon this dies.

               With the absolute silence an even more fierce and living 
               quiet intensifies in the Easterner's face and becomes, as 
               well, sorrow, pity, tenderness, a passionate desire for, and 
               hopelessness of, expiation. The face rises on a high wave of 
               realization, almost transfigured, on the verge, even, of 
               mysticism, yet iron, virile, tragic -- as, very slowly, his 
               eyes still fixed toward the Swede, he walks into extreme 
               CLOSE UP and PAST THE CAMERA out of the shot.

               THE CAMERA HOLDS for a few seconds on the swinging doors, 
               whose subtle breathing stops. Beyond them, through the open 
               door, the air is utterly still.

               LONG SHOT -- THE BLUE HOTEL -- SAME AS THAT WHICH OPENED THE 
               PICTURE

               Three tiny figures walk in single file down the home stretch. 
               In the immense silence we can just hear their feet. They go 
               in. Light gapes and vanishes, as the door opens and closes. 
               After a few seconds, light appears in the upstairs windows. 
               After a few more seconds, the downstairs light goes out. 
               Then one upstairs light. Then the other. The sky is emblazoned 
               with a freezing virulence of patterned stars.

               Almost inaudibly, deep in the distance, o.s. SOUND of a train 
               whistle. In the silence after it, the cold stars sharpen; 
               and very slowly, like a prodigious wheel, the whole sky begins 
               to turn.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                                         THE END
