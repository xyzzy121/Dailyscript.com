               INT. PARKING STRUCTURE - DAY

               JUDE MAZZO, United States Attorney for the District of 
               Columbia, 45, trim, dark full hair. Hey, Jude. It's a name 
               you remember. It sticks in mind. Jude the Obscure.

               Jude Mazzo adjusts his tailored suit, crosses underground 
               structure. The first thing you notice is the walk. The Jude 
               walk. Something between a stroll and a strut. The balls of 
               his feet carry his weight effortlessly; his heels follow, 
               scrapping the concrete in precise hypnotic rhythm. The walk 
               of confidence. His walk presumes order in the space through 
               which it moves, creates an allusion of order if none exists. 
               It says: this space has purpose because I am passing through 
               it.

               This isn't the confidence of unthought arrogance. It's the 
               considered arrogance of a leader. People want order; they 
               crave it like bread or water. Those who create order are 
               avatars, above judgement or suspicion. Their walk, their 
               bearing, the echoing sound of their approaching footsteps 
               are manna for the masses.

               * Mazzo unlocks his metallic navy blue 1987 Beretta, sits 
               in. Stereo blasts "Chantilly Lace," Big Bopper's 1959 rock 
               hit, as he revs engine. Telephone RINGS from speakers. The 
               Big Bopper answers in ersatz negroid:

                                     "CHANTILLY LACE"
                                         (jaunty)
                                     "Hel-lo, ba-by,
                          Yeah, this is the Big Bopper speakin'
                                     (demonic laugh)
                            O-oh, you sweet thang! Do I what?
                                       Will I what?
                          O-oh, ba-by, You kno-ow what I like!"

               Jude squeals off. Sometimes it's not enough to be a born 
               leader. Sometimes you gotta flaunt it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY

               Grey structures squat behind iron gates and lush magnolias. 
               Mazzo's coupe approaches, parks between dark sedans. Jude 
               gets out, tightens his silk tie as he steps toward sidewalk. 
               The tie's just the right touch, obtrusive yet elegant: a sky 
               blue gash neck to navel.

               Mazzo turns at corner, continues down sidewalk. The score 
               picks up where "Chantilly Lace" cuts off. Music surrounds 
               Jude, always pulsing, pushing forward. Screen credits 
               continue.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. KARIN'S APT. BLDG. - DAY

               Jude steps into shadow of six-story Post-modern condominium 
               complex. Enters.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LOBBY - DAY

               Steps to elevator, presses button. Hawaiian paintings adorn 
               far wall.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. FIFTH FLOOR - DAY

               Exits elevator, looks both directions. Hallway empty. Jude 
               walks softly to 5C. He pauses outside door; he pats his hair 
               in place, straightens suit and tie.

               Jude removes key from coat pocket, unlocks door slowly, 
               silently. He tiptoes inside.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KARIN'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

               Jude enters silently. Chain-latches door.

               Jude surveys room with familiar eyes. The only light comes 
               from drawn yellowed window shades; thin strips of exterior 
               green foliage glow underneath.

               The decor jumps out at you: an eclectic jungle of plants and 
               paisley. A wall cluttered with clippings butts into a verdure 
               tapestry. Second Empire chaise strewn with books. Cheap salsa 
               music enhances Green Mansions effect.

               One thing is certain: a woman lives here. Intellectual: 
               definitely. Young: probably. Impulsive: compulsively.

               Light shines from open bedroom. Sheets rustle within. Mazzo 
               lowers salsa muzak, enters. Screen credits continue.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KARIN'S BEDROOM - DAY

               KARIN SCHREIBER, 25, wrapped in pink bed sheet, approaches 
               Jude seductively. Dirty blond hair, pale complexion. Either 
               Dutch or German. She could be a model.

               Karin opens sheet, drapes it shroud-like over Jude's 
               shoulders. He glimpses her nudity. She smiles:

                                     KARIN
                              (teasing)
                         How will you kill me today?

                                     JUDE
                         I'll slit your throat.

               END CREDITS

               Jude removes his blue tie, turns on large TV directly facing 
               Karin's bed. He dials cable box to C-Span: hearings live 
               from Capitol Hill -- on screen, inaudible, some duly elected 
               asshole pontificates. Karin sits on mattress, stretches.

               Jude removes suit jacket, folds it over chair, rhythmnically 
               weaves sex fantasy scenario:

                                     JUDE
                         It's a political scandal. Misused 
                         funds. Pivot this way, toward the 
                         TV. Kinky sex, ruined career, media 
                         rumors, ridicule -- the Senator was 
                         one of the most respected on the 
                         Hill...
                              (Karin swivels)
                         ...yes, just like that. Member of 
                         the Judicial Committee. Considered 
                         above reproach.

               Karin lies facing foot of bed. Random mirrors reflect all 
               four walls. Erotic painting of elaborate coitus, executed in 
               Soviet Social Realist style, hangs beside rack of nightgowns. 
               Stained glass lamps, oddly placed, provide pastel light. 
               This is boudoir, not bedroom.

               Karin watches Mazzo disrobe. He places dress shoes -- black, 
               polished, Italian -- neatly under chair, tucks Picasso pattern 
               socks inside. Folds, stacks shirt and trousers. Karin fluffs 
               her pillow.

               Jude removes bikini briefs, tucks them from sight, slips in 
               bed. Karin welcomes him with a smile.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KARIN'S BEDROOM - DAY

               TIMECUT: salsa music BLARES from stereo. Jude and Karin fuck 
               energetically atop wide oceanic bed. Panting, they change 
               positions, restart. TV casts cathode glow across bed.

               Karin, astride Jude, silhouetted in C-Span. She grips his 
               buttocks, guides penal thrusts. Her breath quickens. His 
               panting breaths echo. She digs her fingers into Mazzo's 
               thighs.

               Jude's hands rise along her torso. Karin shivers at onset of 
               orgasm. She elongates her climax with slow crescendoing 
               SCREAM, each octave a new plateau of pleasure. Karin's voice 
               fades as she slumps forward, GASPING. Her chest flattens 
               upon his. She wheezes, then stops.

               Mazzo pulls himself up beside her -- only then do we notice 
               the blood across his chest and face. Karin is dead. Her throat 
               has been slit. Jude eases Karin's body to sheets as he swings 
               his legs to floor. He stands pulling sheet around waist. 
               Karin watches blank-eyed in pool of blood.

               Jude waddles from bedroom.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KARIN'S BATHROOM - DAY

               Jude showers. Blood washes down drain.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KARIN'S BEDROOM - DAY

               Mazzo, wrapped in sheet, returns to Karin's bed. He rumages 
               through bloodied bed covers until he finds safety razor blade, 
               the murder weapon. He hardly notices Karin. Jude wipes razor 
               blade on bed cover, walks away.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KARIN'S KITCHEN - DAY

               Jude takes a glass from cupboard, opens refrigerator door. 
               He removes, uncaps bottle of dry vermouth. He fingers the 
               glass as he fills it. Jude lifts vermouth to his lips, 
               swallows, shivers.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KARIN'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

               Mazzo enters with bottle and glass, walks to windows. He 
               raises a center shade, looks outside: traffic passes in 
               sunlight. He steps to bookshelf, turns off stereo. The salsa 
               stops.

               Weary, Jude lowers himself onto Karin's sofa. He lies still, 
               wrapped in sheet, cradling vermouth bottle and glass, staring 
               at ceiling. Jude's eyes close. He slips lightly to sleep.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KARIN'S BEDROOM - DAY

               TIMECUT: 30 minutes later. Jude is awake and dressed, his 
               spirits replenished. Music score sets him in motion.

               Mazzo puts on Sahara-brown suit coat as he crosses to bureau. 
               Blue silk tie hangs loose around his neck.

               He pulls white handkerchief from pocket, wraps it around 
               right hand. He opens bureau drawer with covered hand, leaving 
               no fingerprints. Inside, Karin's cash and jewelry lie amid 
               personal possessions.

               Mazzo lifts inlaid box, sets it down. He flips through folded 
               tens and twenties, puts money back, then examines antique 
               jade and silver necklace. Jude pauses to review his strategy. 
               He carefully wraps handkerchief around necklace, places 
               necklace in coat pocket.

               Jude turns to bed where Karin lies twisted in the covers -- 
               still but still beautiful. He pulls tie from neck, turns it 
               over.

               He crouches beside Karin, lifts her hand. Jude gingerly drags 
               the silk tie across Karin's long fingernails. A blue thread 
               catches under her index finger. He pulls tie away, releases 
               her hand. Karin's fingers reflexively curl around the sky 
               blue thread.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KARIN'S KITCHEN - DAY

               Jude enters tying tie.

               He presses his shoe against tile floor, then raises foot to 
               reveal faint bloody footprint. He steps again, leaving fainter 
               and fainter footfalls.

               Jude lifts receiver from wall phone, dials number from memory. 
               He squats against wall, receiver pressed to his ear. He waits, 
               fiddles impatiently. Paperback books are stacked everywhere. 
               Someone finally answers. Jude speaks with cadence of one 
               conditioned to command:

                                     JUDE
                         Hello?
                              (pause)
                         Hello. Homicide, please.
                              (pause)
                         They ought to be answering, unless 
                         they're asleep. A girl has been 
                         murdered.
                              (pause)
                         A girl was killed, I tell you!
                              (pause)
                         2085 M Street.
                              (pause)
                         M Street, not N Street, you idiot!
                              (pause)
                         Who was she? Karin Schreiber. On the 
                         fifth floor.
                              (pause)
                         You got all that? Read it back to 
                         me.

               Mazzo listens, nods, checks watch. Satisfied, he stands to 
               hang up phone. It's time to go.

               He turns back to frig, opens door. Jude removes bottle of 
               Moet champagne, tucks it under his arm. He walks away, leaving 
               refrigerator door ajar.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LOBBY - DAY

               Jude exits elevator, walks to main entrance. His eyes flit 
               side to side. Otherwise, his face's a blank mask.

               The front door opens as Mazzo reaches for handle. He's 
               suddenly face to face with RIA MALED, 24, about to enter. 
               They freeze. Have they met? Do they know each other?

               Ria's dressed chic/casual. Either Arab or Italian. Slightly 
               built with piercing eyes. Suspicious type -- like those 
               longtime students who never graduate.

                                     RIA
                         Excuse me.

                                     JUDE
                         Huh?

                                     RIA
                         Excuse me, please, I'd like to get 
                         through.

                                     JUDE
                         Sorry.

               Mazzo steps back as Ria passes. Jude exits, proceeds to 
               sidewalk. Ria pauses in lobby to watch him. No doubt: he 
               knows our Jude.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. JUSTICE DEPT. - DAY

               * MOVING POV from inside Jude's Beretta: Justice Dept. complex 
               looms immediately ahead. Washington D.C. Capitol Dome crowns 
               the six-story skyline.

               The Justice Department, built 1931-35, a monumental Art Deco 
               structure halfway between the Capital and the White House. 
               It's granite facade is richly decorated with columns, friezes 
               and inscriptions. Military personnel patrol the sidewalks. 
               All visitors are screened. D.C. seems under siege. Pink plexi 
               sign at entrance warns: "Caution, Power Doors Swing Out."

               The FBI Building, 1974, Hoover's monolith, engulfs the 
               neighboring block. Its brutal design dwarfs human scale and 
               feeling.

               SCREENWRITER'S NOTE: Special consideration is given to 
               architecture throughout the script. The story is set in visual 
               brave new world. Post-modern structures, such as Washington 
               Harbour (under construction), U.S. News, Westin and Grand 
               hotels, are favored. International Style buildings are also 
               prefered: L'Enfant Plaza, AFL-CIO, FBI headquarters. 
               Architecture of film need not be beautiful, it need only be 
               new. Historic Washington is irrelevant. Jude Mazzo's a new 
               creation; he needs new space.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. JUDE'S JUSTICE DEPT. OFFICE - DAY

               White collar workers crowd impressive corner office 
               overlooking Pennsylvania Avenue. No flies on this bunch: 
               they exude self-righteousness of underlings on the rise. 
               Today's idealists aching to be tomorrow's bureaucrats.

               A mounted Justice Dept. seal, flanked by U.S. flags, sets 
               the tone. Grid of framed photos feature Mazzo posing with 
               politicians past and present. Two objects stand out from the 
               government-issue decor: a bright Memphis chair and 
               Neoexpressionist map of D.C. Just the right hip.

               The office workers watch CNN. Generic NEWSCASTER speaks framed 
               by blue screen pic of smoking subway platform. Bloodied woman 
               lies in photo foreground.

                                     CNN NEWSCASTER
                         ...The government has taken great 
                         pains to remain calm throughout the 
                         crisis, convinced any appearance of 
                         panic would only encourage terrorists. 
                         The President conducted business as 
                         usual as pressure for action continues 
                         to mount in the wake of the Statue 
                         of Liberty bombing...

               * CNN cuts to file footage of bleeding, frightened tourists 
               streaming from smoke-filled entrance to Statue of Liberty. 
               Paramedics and police hustle them away under glare of TV 
               cameras.

                                     CNN NEWSCASTER
                         ...Rumors of the U.S. response are 
                         the talk of Washington. This we now 
                         know for certain: the Attorney General 
                         will announce, perhaps as soon as 
                         tomorrow, the formation of an ad-hoc 
                         anti-terrorism agency, an elite inter-
                         departmental unit headed by an anti-
                         terrorism "czar." The name most 
                         mentioned...

               YOUNG JUSTICE EMPLOYEE improvs dramatic drum roll.

                                     CNN NEWSCASTER
                         ...is that of Jude Mazzo, the high 
                         profile United States District 
                         Attorney from the District of 
                         Columbia. Steve Dunn has compiled a 
                         background report on Attorney Mazzo. 
                         Steve --

               REPORTER DUNN narrates bio over clips from Mazzo's career. 
               They include:

               -- Jude as young lawyer on courthouse steps.

               -- Jude unveils chart of underworld crime activities.

               -- Jude sworn in.

               -- Jude, in leather jacket and jeans, tells of undercover 
               drug buy.

               -- Jude receives VFW commendation.

               -- Jude at White House reception.

               -- Jude jumping from helicopter, followed by FBI.

               Clips cover five years. In early footage, Jude's dress and 
               manner are bland. Later, he's the opposite: snazzy, confident, 
               charismatic.

                                     REPORTER DUNN (O.S.)
                         ...first burst on the scene with his 
                         vigorous organized crime and drug 
                         prosecutions, breaking all the 
                         unwritten rules. The politicos all 
                         stood their distance, waiting for 
                         Mazzo to take his fall. Instead, 
                         came a wave of convictions. Not 
                         surprisingly, Mazzo turned his 
                         attention to city corruption. Within 
                         eight months, 16 state and local 
                         officials had resigned...

               Mazzo's cohorts joke, wisecrack to screen. Jude's very much 
               a hero here -- both loved and respected.

                                     REPORTER DUNN (O.S.)
                         ...Even those opposed to the new 
                         agency seem to have no objections 
                         concerning Attorney Mazzo. He is, in 
                         the words of the President, "an 
                         American hero."

               Door opens. All eyes turn.

               Jude strides in, Moet bottle under his arm. Office staff 
               bursts into spontaneous applause. Mazzo pops cork, sending 
               spray across room. He speaks rapid-fire:

                                     JUDE
                         Get some glasses, they're in the 
                         cupboard -- not too many. And turn 
                         that thing off. Sandy? I'll never 
                         understand how seemingly intelligent 
                         people who spend their days planting 
                         stories and manipulating coverage 
                         can turn around, flip on the news, 
                         sit there and watch it like God was 
                         sending it down fresh from Mt. Sinai. 
                         Manna!
                              (looks)
                         Great, over here.

               YOUNG OFFICE WORKER distributes plastic glasses as SANDY, an 
               "Executive Assistant," turns off TV. Jude spills champagne 
               as he pours from glass to glass.

                                     YOUNG OFFICE EMPLOYEE
                         Congratulations, sir.

               Others echo congratulations. Jude pours:

                                     JUDE
                         Here, here. Thank you.
                              (suddenly harsh)
                         Stop!

               They all freeze. Awkward silence.

                                     JUDE
                         This is no time for celebration.
                              (pauses for effect)
                         And you can quote me on that.

               Jude breaks into laugh, takes swig. Impromptu party resumes. 
               Staff divides into threes and fours.

               ALAN, 29, speaks with fellow EXECUTIVE ASSISTANT out of 
               earshot:

                                     ALAN
                         Who's Mazzo taking to the new agency?

                                     EXECUTIVE ASSISTANT
                         Get in line: that's what everybody 
                         wants to know. That's where the 
                         action's gonna be. And Jude ain't 
                         talking.

               Jude, working crowd, approaches:

                                     ALAN
                         We're going to miss you.

                                     EXECUTIVE ASSISTANT
                         It won't be the same.

                                     JUDE
                         I'll be around. You can't get rid of 
                         me that easy. Besides, Milton will 
                         step right in.

                                     EXECUTIVE ASSISTANT
                         It won't be the same.

               SECOND EXECUTIVE ASSISTANT joins them. Jude turns to him:

                                     JUDE
                         What's green with four legs and does 
                         impressions?

                                     ALAN
                              (to 2nd Ass't)
                         Don't answer.

                                     JUDE
                         I want it on my desk in the morning. 
                         Clayton, right?
                              (walks off)

                                     ALAN
                         That's how he gets his jokes.

               Jude steps beside ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY AVERY MILTON, Jude's 
               right-hand man and confidant. Ass't Attorney Milton, late 
               fifties, seems more suited to office than courtroom. He's 
               quite content to stand in Jude's shadow.

                                     MILTON
                         So, congratulations once again.

                                     JUDE
                         Thanks, Milt.

               Mazzo, smiling, calls to unseen staff member:

                                     JUDE
                         You're coming with me, don't forget!

               Milton suppresses sting of slight: he hasn't been asked. 
               Nearby, TWO ATTORNEYS dish breaking murder:

               Mazzo and Milton walk over. Second Attorney brightens, fawns:

                         the "political angle." Probably

                              (cuts in)
                         Where?

                                     2ND ATTORNEY
                         N Street. Two thousand something.

                                     JUDE
                              (disgusted)
                         What did your brain do while your 
                         dick was going to law school? 2000 N 
                         is a vacant lot! And don't be so 
                         fast to jump to judgement.
                              (calls to others)
                         There's only one guilty person around 
                         here!

               All stop silent. Second Attorney shrivels in pinstripes, his 
               career hanging by a thread. Jude laughs:

                                     JUDE
                         And that's me!

               Two Attorneys, relieved, join laughter. Mazzo resumes 
               conversation with First Attorney:

                                     JUDE
                         They want us there? The Justice 
                         Department?

                                     1ST ATTORNEY
                         That's what I hear. Request en route.

                                     JUDE
                              (to Milton)
                         Well, let's dig it out. Thank God, I 
                         thought I was going to have to spend 
                         my last day here drinking champagne -- 
                         I don't even like champagne. Com'on, 
                         Milt, let's go.

               They walk off. Second Attorney turns to First:

                                     2ND ATTORNEY
                         Tell me I'm wrong. Tell me I didn't 
                         fuck my promotion.
                              (slaps head)
                         Damn!

                                                                    CUT TO:

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. KARIN'S APT. - NIGHT

               Jude/Milton MOVING POV inside car: 2085 M Street appears 
               amid flashing red and yellow lights. D.C. police cordon off 
               reporters and onlookers. TWO PARAMEDICS rest against 
               ambulance, as if awaiting instructions.

               * PATROLMAN recognizes Jude as Beretta parks. He escorts 
               Mazzo and Milton through crowd as pushing newsmen call, "Judi, 
               Judi." Mazzo acknowledges photo flashbulbs as he enters.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KARIN'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               "Evidence Gathering Technicians" take notes, collect 
               fingerprints, label evidence. Policeman crosses from living 
               room to kitchen. No one seems in a hurry. Faint red light 
               flashes below partially drawn window shade.

               Two plainclothes officials chat casually near bedroom door. 
               DECT. GILBERT GIDEON, 48, FBI, speaks in tones befitting 
               seniority. LT. MICHAEL WEISS, 37, District of Columbia 
               Homicide Division, listens to Gideon, defers, smiles. Both 
               men, conservatively dressed, exude careerism: intense, 
               intelligent, well-exercised.

               Jude's arrival causes immediate stir. They've been waiting 
               for him. Mazzo nods to others as he and Milton join Gideon 
               and Weiss, exchange handshakes:

                                     DECT. GIDEON
                         Thanks for coming yourself, Mr. 
                         Attorney. I know you're busy. You 
                         know Lt. Weiss, D.C. Homicide -- ?

                                     JUDE
                              (nods)
                         What took you so long to call in the 
                         request, Gideon?
                              (to Weiss)
                         Just look, Lieutenant, and hope you 
                         never know the hell of a FBI man 
                         asking for help --

                                     DECT. GIDEON
                              (defensive)
                         The Bureau can't afford mistakes. I 
                         had to be certain of the foreign 
                         policy ramifications. Then we found 
                         this. Look.

               Gideon takes bound leather address book from shelf, hands it 
               to Mazzo:

                         Her address book: diplomats, lefties, 
                         lobbyists -- goddamn Who's Who. Just 
                         look at the first name under "B." 
                         Your name is even in there.

                         In the bedroom.

                         Let's take a look.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KARIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Jude and others enter "boudoir" as Technicians collate 
               evidence. Jude, expressionless, scans room as if seeing it 
               for the first time. Adjusts his tie.

               Bed furnishings, measured, labeled, remain as before. Karin's 
               body lies unmoved under pink sheets.

                                     LT. WEISS
                         Karin Schreiber, 24, Dutch passport.

               Jude pauses at portable tape player atop TV, depresses "play" 
               lever. Tape hiss followed by phone RING. Big Bopper answers 
               from two-inch speakers: "Hel-lo, ba-by. Yeah, this is the 
               Big Bopper Speakin.'"

                                     JUDE
                         Pull back the sheets.

               Mazzo watches as EVIDENCE GATHERING TECHNICIAN #1 unveils 
               Karin's body. Dry blood forms Rorschach stain beside her 
               neck. Jude tilts his head to study corpse: very sexy, very 
               Madame Tussard.

                                     DECT. GIDEON
                         Clean razor wound. No trace of the 
                         murder weapon.

                                     JUDE
                         Cover her up. Who's name was the 
                         apartment in?

               Mazzo steps into bathroom, turns shower nozzle on and off. 
               Gideon ejects "Chantilly Lace" as others observe from bedroom.

                                     LT. WEISS
                         Hers. The victim.

                                     JUDE
                         The neighbor?

                                     LT. WEISS
                         A doctor... A man completely above 
                         suspicion. The other apartment vacant --

                                     JUDE
                         And who gets everything? The husband?

                                     LT. WEISS
                         Separated three years.

               Mazzo examines tile floor; pink stain washes down drain.

                                     JUDE
                         Bring him in for questioning.

               Weiss eyeballs Gideon: whose case is it? D.C.P.D. or FBI? 
               Mazzo retraces steps through bedroom:

                                     JUDE
                         Who's conducting the investigation?

                                     LT. WEISS
                         Homicide --

                                     DECT. GIDEON
                         FBI.

                                     LT. WEISS
                         D.C. Homicide will continue its 
                         investigation.

               Gideon shrugs. Local cops are Gumbies in FBI world view. 
               Mazzo continues into kitchen.

                                     DECT. GIDEON

                         Keep it. I want no coverup.

               EVIDENCE GATHERING TECHNICIAN #2 approaches with stack of 
               black-and-white glossies.

                                     TECHNICIAN #2
                              (eager)
                         Look, the victim posed for these 
                         crime scene photographs. Like some 
                         cheap magazine. Obviously taken by 
                         an amateur.

               Technician displays 8x10 "crime scene" stills. In each Karin 
               Schreiber is the "victim." Jude's eyes fix on photos. They 
               feature:

               -- Karin, fully clothed, slumped against toilet bowl.

               -- Karin, in bra and panties, face-down on carpet, plastic 
               fish in her mouth.

               -- Karin, wearing only mini-skirt, draped over bed. Her body 
               covered with record albums and tapes.

               Laughing VOICES initiate flashback.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A year before. Jude and Karin at play, laughing as they stage 
               "crime scene" photos. Big Bopper sings on stereo.

               Mazzo, hair tussled, wields Nikon like work tool. Barefoot, 
               he wears white shirt, dark trousers. He's ten pounds heavier. 
               Karin leans head against bureau.

                                     JUDE
                         Don't move!

               Jude snaps picture. FLASH!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KARIN'S BATHROOM - DAY -FLASHBACK-

               TIMECUT. "Seventy-six Trombones" plays as Karin poses over 
               toilet. She twists head, drops jaw, stares vacantly. Jude 
               moves erratically, testing camera angles, speaking as if 
               spellbound:

                                     JUDE
                         ...She was a SAS stewardess. Having 
                         an affair with two different pilots -- 
                         both at 37,000 feet! We found her in 
                         the ladies room at JFK, choked, just 
                         like that. A real beauty. Hold it.

               Mazzo snaps another pic -- FLASH! -- pulls Karin to feet:

                                     JUDE
                         Who do you want to do now?

                         The rock and roll singer! Julie!

                                     JUDE
                         Right.

               * SCREENWRITER'S NOTE: The choice of pop source music (with 
               the exception of "Chantilly Lace") is indicative, not 
               proscriptive. Jude is the product of rock and roll, more 
               Presley than politics. Source music should also provide ironic 
               counterpoint to action, reinforcing symbolic drama -- keeping 
               viewer at arm's length. Alternative titles, equally effective, 
               spring to mind: "Changes" by David Bowie, "Hanky Panky" by 
               Tommy James and the Shondells, "Man Machine" by Kraftwerk, 
               "Imagine" by John Lennon, etc.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               TIMECUT. Karin, mini-skirted, hangs half-naked over bed. 
               Joan Jett sings "I Love Rock and Roll." Jude narrates 
               scenario:

                                     JUDE
                         ...she's found in a cheap motel

                         out, body covered with record albums 
                         and tapes -- all sacred music...

               Mazzo yanks albums from shelves, places them on Karin as she 
               hums mantra "om."

                                     JUDE

                         voice coming from the jukebox like 
                         an angel's.

               man..." Mazzo bounds about, ecstatic. Karin howls with 
               laughter.

               They grow frenetic with each enactment. Their psyches meld 
               for a moment: is it sex or is it symbiosis? Jude circles:

                         after she was dead...

               END OF FLASHBACK

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KARIN'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

               U.S. Attorney Mazzo turns from "crime scene" photos, walks 
               over bloody footprints (now covered with plastic). Gideon 
               joins him from bedroom:

                                     DECT. GIDEON
                         He must have been an idiot.

                                     JUDE
                         Who?

                                     DECT. GIDEON
                         The killer.

                                     JUDE
                         Why is he an idiot?

                                     DECT. GIDEON
                         Because of the way he acted. Stupidly 
                         and arrogantly. He empties her jewelry 
                         box but dosen't take the money. He 
                         kills her, then marches into the 
                         john to shower. Puts shoes on, leaves 
                         footprints across kitchen. Just 
                         stupid.

                                     JUDE
                         According to you.

               Mazzo and Gideon stare eye to eye; their rivalry rises to 
               surface. Gideon bites lip, represses resentment. "Just wait," 
               Gideon's eyeballs say, "I too will have my day."

               Jude puts his arm around Detective Gideon:

                                     JUDE
                         You know I have put together a task 
                         force for NATA, the new antiterror 
                         agency, Gid, and I was thinking I 
                         might have something that would 
                         interest you.

               Gideon's honored but wary. He quickly calculates pros and 
               cons:

                                     DECT. GIDEON
                         God knows I'm flattered. Honest, 
                         Jude. I'm just not sure I could work 
                         for you --

                                     JUDE
                         Name a position.

                                     DECT. GIDEON
                              (shakes head)
                         I'm willing to be swallowed but not 
                         digested. I don't want to end up in 
                         the rectum.

                                     JUDE
                         I respect that. I can respect dumb.

               Mazzo walks back toward bedroom.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KARIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Jude watches as Paramedics lower Karin's body onto stretcher, 
               looks to Milton and Weiss:

                                     JUDE
                         I really wish it were the husband, 
                         too. It would be easier.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LOBBY - NIGHT

               Hawaiian silkscreens now top lit, hang on wall. Mazzo and 
               Milton cross as cops screen incoming residents. Ahead, TV 
               lights glare blindingly through front doors.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. KARIN'S APT. BLDG. - NIGHT

               Reporters yell questions as Jude/Milton squeeze through press 
               gauntlet without comment. Mazzo turns to favor "Eyewitness 
               News" crew, recognizes dim profile in crowd: Ria Maled. Jude 
               quickly continues; Milt follows.

               Mazzo subtly motions to SAM ZEGNER, 23, peach-fuzzed "print 
               journalist," as he and Avery approach Beretta. Jude points 
               to pay phone, dials in pantomine. Sam responds with nod as 
               Mazzo and Milton enter car, drive away.

               Sam scurries to phone booth, inserts coin, punches dial 
               buttons: the Jimmy Olson illusion vanishes -- just another 
               headline whore.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BERETTA - NIGHT

               Carphone RINGS. Jude picks up receiver as they drive south 
               through Georgetown. Sam speaks from M Street phone booth, 
               sometimes OFF SCREEN, sometimes ON SCREEN:

                                     SAM
                         Rumor says we got a scandal. Great 
                         going away present, huh, Attorney? 
                         Or should I call you Director? 
                         Congratulations by the way. So? So?

                                     JUDE
                         It's still "Mr. Attorney" and no 
                         comment, Sam.

                                     SAM
                         Jude, please. I've got a lot of dirty 
                         minds to feed.

                                     JUDE
                         Just this -- but it didn't come from 
                         me...

                                     SAM
                         Of course not -- I'm not even on the 
                         phone.

                                     JUDE
                         The place reeked of sex. You can't 
                         imagine. Unnatural acts. Really 
                         disgusting -- and one other thing. 
                         We didn't find any underwear in the 
                         apartment. None. Not anywhere.

                                     SAM
                         Sex crime?

                                     JUDE
                         No, she just didn't wear any. Your 
                         readers oughtta like that.

                                     SAM
                         Great, I'll lead with it. Any names 
                         involved? Diplomatic corps, I bet. 
                         Right? Why else would you be there? 
                         Must be big --

                                     JUDE
                         False alarm, nothing there. The Bureau 
                         and D.C.P.D. will investigate -- if 
                         they can stop pissin on each other.
                              (a beat)
                         Go for the crime-of-passion, Sam. 
                         Lead with the domestic angle, follow 
                         with the kink. Play up the husband. 
                         He's the key. Trust me. Do this for 
                         me, okay?

                                     SAM
                         Great, thanks.
                              (Jude hangs up)

               Mazzo doesn't bother with goodbyes. Conversation terminated. 
               Never transpired.

               Georgetown U. shops and bars pass right and left. Milton 
               hasn't spoken for some time. Jude turns to him:

                                     JUDE
                         I want you to keep me informed on 
                         this Schreiber case, Milt. Keep on 
                         it.

                                     MILTON
                         From the Justice Department? I don't 
                         even know what my job will be after 
                         you leave. I may not have access. I 
                         may not have a desk.

                                     JUDE
                         What do you mean, Justice Department?
                              (a beat)
                         Didn't I tell you?

                                     MILTON
                              (confused)
                         What?

                                     JUDE
                         Do you think I'd let someone as good 
                         as you slip through my hands? You're 
                         coming with me to NATA -- as first 
                         or second assistant, unless something 
                         else, of course. I told you weeks 
                         ago.

               Avery's palpably relieved. His fear of being left behind had 
               become an obsession. He would have, of course, remembered an 
               earlier offer -- that's for sure! -- no matter now.

                                     MILTON
                         I remember now...

                                     JUDE
                         Maybe I wasn't clear.

                                     MILTON
                         I appreciate the faith you have in 
                         me. I won't let you down.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. WASHINGTON HARBOUR - NIGHT

               Later that night. Beretta drives under Whitehurst Freeway, 
               turns in sprawling commercial/residential complex -- the 
               "Washington Harbour" development, completion date 1987, 
               Postmodern equivalent of Watergate Office Building: just as 
               ugly, twice as trendy. On the Potomac, south of Georgetown, 
               Washington Harbour boasts Cuisinart mix of arches, ariels, 
               bays and balconies -- a yuppie Watts Towers.

               Jude parks in assigned space, enters door flanked by 
               ornamental columns. Lawn lights exaggerate structure's fairy 
               tale architecture.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. 1ST FLOOR HALL - NIGHT

               He passes mirror of trompe l'oeil wallpaper, waits for 
               elevator, steps in as doors close.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. 2ND FLOOR HALL - NIGHT

               Jude rounds corner, approaches through corridor of "Etruscan" 
               murals. Each floor has distinct decor -- each a tier of 
               tackiness.

               Mazzo withdraws keys, unlocks apartment door.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. JUDE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Jude strides across rectangle room overlooking Potomac. 
               Arlington County glistens out the window. Furniture and found 
               objects sit at odd angles; behind, a Shaker pew is stacked 
               with file cartons. "Superman" pinball machine stands behind.

               Brian Ferry croons "The Stroll" from vintage Rockola jukebox; 
               Jude's footsteps echo Ferry's beat. He loosens his tie.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. JUDE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Jude closes door, sits at custom-made desk -- crescent slab 
               of green marble atop Mission Style base. Faded "Washington 
               Senators" pennant hangs between celebrity photos. Bookshelves 
               blanket the adjoining walls. CNN plays silently on desktop 
               TV.

               Jude removes Karin's purloined necklace, unwraps it. After 
               brief glimpse, he rewraps necklace in handkerchief, locks it 
               in desk drawer.

               Mazzo stares at black phone. It RINGS OFF SCREEN.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. JUDE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Mazzo rolls around sheets, unable to sleep. OFF SCREEN 
               telephone RINGS. Karin speaks in flashback:

                                     KARIN (V.O.)
                         Mr. Attorney? You don't know me. How 
                         could you? We never met. Think I go 
                         around with cops?...

               INT. KARIN'S BEDROOM - DAY -FLASHBACK-

               Eighteen months before. Karin, wearing brown negligee, sits 
               on bed, speaks on phone. Poising finger over disconnect 
               button, she laughs into receiver. Dialogue continuous from 
               previous scene:

                                     KARIN
                         (Taunting)
                         ...Who am I? Maybe I'm a terrorist. 
                         One of the two thousand terrorists 
                         running free you talk so much about. 
                         Bet you think you're sexy in those 
                         discount suits that bulge up the 
                         crotch?
                              (a beat)
                         What's my name?
                              (laughs)
                         Why don't you find out? You're so 
                         smart. Always giving interviews, 
                         being photographed -- speaking of 
                         which, you should lose some weight.

               INT. KARIN'S BEDROOM - DAY -FLASHBACK-

               Similar day. Karin, half in negligee, stretches through sheets 
               as she speaks to Jude, insinuating phone sex like sorority 
               cockteaser.

                                     KARIN
                         ...Mr. United States Attorney. Such 
                         a man. Can't even find a horny 
                         terrorist sympathizer. Can't even 
                         find an obscene caller, the most 
                         obvious thing in the world, an obscene 
                         caller, naked, lying here, feeling 
                         herself, thinking about Mr. U.S. 
                         Attorney thinking about me in his 
                         ugly black shoes all cops wear, with 
                         Vibram soles...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KARIN'S BEDROOM - DAY -FLASHBACK-

               Similar day. Karin, in open robe, bolts upright in bed. Her 
               phone montage continues:

                                     KARIN
                              (faking fear)
                         ...Oh, help me, help me! Mr. Attorney, 
                         someone is breaking into my apartment. 
                         He's crazy. I think he's tapping my 
                         phone. He's trying to get me! He 
                         wants to rape me!
                              (looks up)
                         He's here now! And he has no pants 
                         on!
                              (falls back)
                         I'm all alone with the man who will 
                         rape me. That's my destiny. I need 
                         you...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KARIN'S BATHROOM - DAY -FLASHBACK-

               Similar day. Karin, on phone, smoking cigarette, soaks in 
               steamy tub. Bath water reveals her body.

                                     KARIN
                         ...always in black -- did somebody 
                         die on you?
                              (a beat)
                         Don't kid yourself. You don't appeal 
                         to me. You're just a typical little 
                         man with a typical belly, a 
                         bureaucrat. I imagine you must sweat 
                         and wear cheap musk aftershave -- 
                         certainly not my favorite...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KARIN'S BEDROOM - EVENING -FLASHBACK-

               Similar day. Last sun glows through translucent window shades. 
               Karin, nude but for lace shawl, leans cross-legged on bed. 
               Brown phone rests strategically atop her crotch. Black cord 
               runs between her thighs, across her breasts. Karin steadies 
               base with one hand, fingers cord with other as she continues 
               in medias res:

                                     KARIN
                         ...a D.A. must know a million secrets, 
                         just like a priest. Actually it's 
                         your mind I like. I admire all police. 
                         I'd love to be a stoolie. If you 
                         gave me the third degree I would do 
                         anything.
                              (listens: flares)
                         Do that with your mother 'cause she's 
                         used to it!

               On screen, old building burns inaudibly -- it could be a 
               news report, it could be a movie.

               SOUND: front door opening. Squeaky FOOTSTEPS. She flips off 
               tube, twists head:

                                     KARIN
                         Who is it?

               Door latches shut. Black shoes enter screen left. With Vibram 
               soles. Jude steps in, speaking on wireless phone. He has 
               been conversing en route.

                                     JUDE
                         Police.

               Mazzo, sweaty, Nixon-eyed, enters in ill-fit black suit, 
               white shirt, wrinkled tie. Matted clump of hair hangs on 
               forehead. Stomach paunch stretches shirt. No cool Jude, this.

               He crosses living area, stands in boudoir. Karin slams 
               receiver down, makes no attempt to cover herself:

                                     KARIN
                         It's you, Mr. Attorney. I thought it 
                         was either the police or a junkie.

               Jude rests receiver on table, suspiciously sniffs hand-rolled 
               cigarette, replaces butt in ashtray. Karin rolls over, 
               wrapping bod in bed sheets. Mazzo circles:

                                     JUDE
                         What do you want from me?

                                     KARIN
                         Just a little fun.

                                     JUDE
                         Why didn't you call the Vice 
                         Department?

                                     KARIN
                              (insulted)
                         What kind of girl do you think I am?

               Jude withdraws a stapled stack of phone bills from vest 
               pocket, displays them:

                                     JUDE
                         Your phone calls this year. You know 
                         these people? 244-4832? Huh?

                                     KARIN
                         They're friends.

                                     JUDE
                         They're terrorists -- suspected 
                         terrorists, or sympathizers.

                                     KARIN
                         I don't care about politics.

                                     JUDE
                         They're criminals. Murderers.

               Karin leans back.

                                     JUDE
                         Did you really think you were going 
                         to get away with it?

               She shifts onto side, revealing bare breast, aroused aureola, 
               nipple. Soothing strip of naked skin runs length of Karin's 
               body, over hill, over dale. She turns to Jude with o-so brutal 
               bedroom eyes:

                                     KARIN
                         What are you going to do with me now 
                         that you found me, Mr. Attorney? 
                         Torture me? Just a little?

               END OF FLASHBACK

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. JUSTICE DEPT. RECEPTION HALL - DAY

               TV lights harshly illuminate the Grand Reception Hall: a 
               press conference is underway. Deco room is dominated by WPA 
               aluminum statues, one on either side of stage. Semi-nude 12-
               foot figures, male and female, symbolize "The Spirit of 
               Justice" (female) and "The Majesty of the Law" (male).

               On stage, Jude Mazzo stands out in a line of look-alike 
               bureaucrats. The more inconspicuous he tries to appear, the 
               more conspicuous he is. He's the star here and knows it.

               Press listens patiently as ATTORNEY GENERAL WILLIAM GABRIEL 
               reads prepared remarks. Gabriel, 60, bald, counter-points 
               jutting jaw with sympathetic expression. ASSISTANT A.G., 
               40ish, button-down career type, stands beside him.

                                     ATTORNEY GENERAL
                         Just as the early years of this 
                         century demanded a new law enforcement 
                         bureau, the FBI, so these difficult 
                         times require a new, independent 
                         antiterrorist agency, NATA, which 
                         will coordinate efforts of the Justice 
                         and State Departments, Army, Navy, 
                         Air Force, Marine Corps, FBI, CIA, 
                         NSC and agencies of friendly 
                         governments...

               TIMECUT. Jude, at podium, concludes statement with "Thank 
               you."

               Press jumps to life. Questions fly. Here's a man to their 
               liking. Here's a man who can sell newspapers.

               Jude is at ease, confident. He mixes sincerity with affability -- 
               the mark of a political star. We hear, in JUMP CUTS, his 
               answers:

                                     JUDE
                         There may be some inter-agency 
                         friction at first -- even "rivalry" 
                         as you suggest. NATA isn't the 
                         problem, it's the answer.
                              (jump cut)
                         My father was a proud man, not wealthy 
                         but proud. It hurt him so much to 
                         hear and read the things people said 
                         about Italian-Americans. He wanted 
                         his son to be a lawyer so others 
                         wouldn't think we were gangsters, so 
                         others would know we loved America 
                         too.
                              (jump cut)
                         My "high profile"? I'm glad you asked 
                         that -- again. I've always felt law 
                         enforcement is meant to be high 
                         profile. The United States shouldn't 
                         hide from terrorists -- they don't 
                         respect cowardice or vacillation. 
                         Terrorists know who I am and where 
                         to find me. If you want to call that 
                         high profile -- well, go ahead. I 
                         have no desire to be high profile 
                         for myself. My goal is to become 
                         unknown. The better I do my job the 
                         sooner I'll be unknown. In five years 
                         I plan to be a trivia question.

               Reporters laugh. Others, younger, watch enrapted.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. NATA HEADQUARTERS - DAY

               West Washington is Capitol's current architectural showcase. 
               Post-modern structures stand shoulder to shoulder along M 
               Street from 24th to 22nd. Similar buildings -- replete with 
               arches and domes -- dot surrounding streets.

               NATA headquarters occupies three-story townhouse near 24th 
               and M. Its facade has been restyled to match neighborhood. 
               No identifying sign or plaque. Only a concrete curbside 
               barrier indicates nature of building. Uniformed officer in 
               doorway.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. NATA CORRIDOR - DAY

               Inside, townhouse is maze of renovation. Building has been 
               gutted and redesigned, custom-fitted with latest law 
               enforcement technology.

               Workmen paint unfinished trim as Director Mazzo leads phalanx 
               of subordinates down corridor. The new staffers, young, 
               unflapable, radiate self-confidence. Jude has chosen the 
               best and brightest. Milton and Alan, Executive Assistant 
               from scene 17, follow him.

               They wear laminated identification tags around necks. All 
               federal employees and visitors must display color-coded tags 
               indicating their department and security status. Jude, Milt 
               and Alan pass through metal detector as guard glances at 
               their tags.

               Additional staffers stand outside conference room as Jude 
               and others enter, exchange greetings.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. NATA CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

               Assigned representatives from various law enforcement agencies 
               sit at lined rows of tables. Name cards identify each: State 
               Dept, Defense Dept, Joint Chiefs, FBI, IG/T, NSC, various 
               state and local police. NATA staffers occupy chairs behind 
               them.

               Vacant folding table faces the others. NATA seal hangs behind 
               table. Room is quiet, as if gossip were a security breach.

               Then, suddenly, Jude strides through, laughing and talking. 
               Everyone rises. Jude calls out:

                                     JUDE
                         Sit down, please! And loosen up! It 
                         feels like goddamn Bulgaria in here.

               They chuckle, comply. Jude takes a beat, says as he sits:

                                     JUDE
                         Just remember to loosen up real tight.

               Laughter. Mazzo unfolds prepared remarks as he surveys room. 
               He's seen from many points of view, some quick, some in 
               motion:

                                     JUDE
                         I wanted to bring all the agencies 
                         and departments together if only for 
                         this first meeting. We're all now 
                         part of NATA.
                              (speaks from notes)
                         I'm not a politician but I've been 
                         put in charge of a political agency. 
                         That's different from my old job of 
                         prosecuting criminals. Isn't it 
                         significant to you that this 
                         administration choose a man like me 
                         at a time like this to direct so 
                         sensitive an agency? Consider the 
                         reasons they singled me out. Let's 
                         glance at criminal acts and political 
                         acts. The simple basic truth is there 
                         is no distinction at all today -- 
                         they're alike, the activist and the 
                         criminal.
                              (passionate)
                         Here's a rule and you better start 
                         to memorize it! In every criminal 
                         there is a subversive and in every 
                         subversive there is a criminal! No 
                         wonder we find terrorists so often 
                         involved in crimes like kidnapping 
                         and robbery. The difference between 
                         those who rob banks and those 
                         spreading terror is too small to be 
                         taken into account. They have the 
                         same objective, the criminal and the 
                         terrorist, even though they use 
                         different means: they want to overturn 
                         our present social order, our way of 
                         life! The Law shall prevail against 
                         upheaval. The Law is permanent and 
                         timeless, like sculpture, like a 
                         temple. They call this "The Age of 
                         Terrorism" -- and it's easy to see 
                         why. Governments cower as their 
                         leaders wheel and deal with criminals. 
                         Nations are held hostage by thugs 
                         and vandals. Cowardice is called 
                         diplomacy. The Law is mocked. Justice 
                         walks the streets like a whore. And 
                         what do we do? We defenders of the 
                         Law? We watch in disarray, play 
                         politics, blame each other.
                              (emphatic)
                         No more. Remember this day. It marks 
                         the end of the Age of Terrorism. The 
                         Law will be redeemed!
                              (stands)
                         The Law is the answer! America is 
                         back!

               Others burst into spontaneous applause as they rise.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. NATA COMPUTER CENTER - DAY

               Mazzo and VICTOR, 30, NATA archivist, enter micro-chip brain 
               bank center. They pass high-tech cubicles, each with computer 
               terminal. The room's almost ready. A few employees are already 
               on the job. Across room, electricians rewire switch box.

               All rows lead to "supercomputer" with four bug-eye screens. 
               They approach as COMPUTER TECHNICIAN programs console. Victor, 
               all business, speaks with deceptive drawl:

                         Each terminal feeds into the super-
                         computer, we call it "Big Moma," 
                         which connects to NCIC at FBI and 
                         select access at Langley. NCIC alone 
                         can handle 400,000 requests a day.

                         felon, every taxpayer. Every time 
                         anybody ever plugged into the system -- 
                         it's all here. Completely legal, too -- 
                         with memory hide just in case.

               Assistant A.G. stands beside bookshelves. Gabriel dismisses 
               him with flick of eye. Assistant exits with lacky alacrity.

                         So, Jude? Satisfied?

               Mazzo sits straight in Eileen Gray chair. Jude's tone varies, 
               at times impassioned, other times hurt, coy, ingratiating -- 
               but always calculated:

                         Fine. Though sometimes I think I'm 
                         being set up, you know, the scapegoat 
                         for all this inter-agency feuding. I 
                         wouldn't want a scandal. I know the 
                         President views this seriously --

                         perhaps a hundred. The country is 
                         frightened. And more funding so we 
                         could pay our informers better.

               Gabriel paces, examines object d'art, returns to seat:

                         photograph.

                                     JUDE
                              (sheepish)
                         Well, I, ah, used to know her. In 
                         fact she and I had... a little... 
                         affair.

               Gabriel smiles, impressed:

                                     ATTORNEY GENERAL
                         Not bad.
                              (lascivious)
                         How was she? Good?

                                     JUDE
                              (awkward)
                         Well... not bad...
                              (hesitates)
                         Well, I wanted to know if I should 
                         inform the agents who are on it. I 
                         don't know, I really don't.

               Gabriel stands without comment, terminates meeting:

                                     ATTORNEY GENERAL
                              (pleasant)
                         Good day.

                                     JUDE
                         Is that all?

               Attorney Gabriel escorts Mazzo to door like proud father:

                                     ATTORNEY GENERAL
                         That's it.
                              (shakes Jude's hand)
                         They're all watching you, Jude. You've 
                         made quite an impression. You've got 
                         the press like this:
                              (cups hand)
                         There's one thing I don't understand. 
                         Why do you think people like you so?

               Jude answers without hesitation, as if stating a simple fact:

                                     JUDE
                              (ingenuous)
                         I make 'em feel good.

               Gabriel nods, walks toward desk, turning to Jude as Mazzo 
               exits:

                                     ATTORNEY GENERAL
                         The husband. It must be him.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. JUDE'S JUSTICE DEPT. OFFICE - DAY

               Lt. Weiss watches as Mazzo packs memorabilia in Bekins box: 
               ceremonial paperweight, photos, etc. His office is half-empty, 
               stripped of non-institutional furnishings. Jude's moving to 
               NATA.

                                     LT. WEISS
                         Sure I can't help, Director?

                         Almost done. First rule of public 
                         service: pack quick. I'll be at NATA 
                         tomorrow. You started to brief me on 
                         the Schreiber case -- I hate to see 
                         my last case unsolved. It's like 
                         leaving dirty laundry -- Milt shoulda 
                         been here by now.

                         You know there's this jurisdictional 
                         thing between us and FBI. Day to 
                         day, D.C. gets nothing from the 
                         Bureau. But come a sexy case and 
                         they're all over us, pulling rank, 
                         taking credit. I'm sick of it.

                                     JUDE
                         Too bad you couldn't come with me to 
                         NATA.

                         Huh?

                         I wanted you.

                         It was just that damn N.C. urine 
                         test. Winston-Salem, 1979, with minute 
                         traces of you-know-what -- and it's 
                         not just me who knows.

                         It was a college thing, honest. They 
                         said it was off the books. I know it 
                         was --

                                     JUDE
                         Don't worry. It's under control. 
                         I'll just bring you in later.

                         I do. Don't apologize.
                              (looks up)
                         Here's Milton.
                              (to Milt)
                         Where were you? Lt. Weiss was bringing 
                         me up to date on Schreiber.

                                     MILTON
                              (nods to Weiss)
                         I've already heard.

               Lt. Weiss recites report:

                                     LT. WEISS
                         Looks like you were right on the 
                         husband. We tracked him, then Gideon 
                         pulled rank, took him to FBI. I hear 
                         he's babbling like a brook. Guess 
                         what? The lab crew turned up a pale 
                         blue thread from under the victim's 
                         fingernail. A single strand. It must 
                         come from the killer's tie.

                                     JUDE
                         His tie?

                                     MILTON
                         Yeah, his tie.

                                     JUDE
                              (scornful)
                         First you told me the killer was 
                         nude, in the sex act, now he's humping 
                         nude with a blue tie on -- right?

               Weiss and Milton, chagrined, exchange exculpatory glances.

                                     LT. WEISS
                         We're waiting for the thread analysis. 
                         And there are the fingerprints, of 
                         course. They're at FBI too. There's 
                         nothing solid there. Only yours.

               EXT. FBI BUILDING - AFTERNOON

               Amber-lit in brutal majesty. FEMALE VOICE heard from within:

                                     FINGERPRINT ANALYST (O.S.)
                         ...surprisingly little considering 
                         the circumstances. The victim's 
                         prints, those of the cleaning woman, 
                         irretrievable grease-marks...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               CLOSE-UP: back-lit slides of fingerprints taken from crime 
               scene. Uninflected VOICE continues:

                         ...perhaps the killer cleaned up, 
                         perhaps he wore gloves --

                         He?

               Mazzo, Gideon, Milton and Weiss flank Bryn Mawrish FBI 
               FINGERPRINT ANALYST, 26. Male colleagues work nearby. LFAU 
               lab is immaculate.

                                     DECT. GIDEON
                         Judging from wound and bruises, 
                         assailant is male, well-built, perhaps 
                         short in stature.

               Description fits Jude.

                                     F'PRINT ANALYST
                              (points)
                         These are Director Mazzo's.

               Lt. Weiss leans to examine slides:

                         Here's the shower faucet -- you turned 
                         it on. The refrigerator handle. 
                         Several from a drinking glass.

                                     MILTON
                              (unctuous)
                         You had a drink of water, remember, 
                         Director? You weren't feeling well.

               Dect. Gideon watches as Weiss and Milton vie to rationalize 
               Jude's fingerprints.

                                     LT. WEISS

                                     MILTON
                         You made a call. I saw you.

                         The tape deck. You played that.
                              (to Gideon)
                         What about the thread? From the tie?

               Gideon takes moment to answer:

                                     DECT. GIDEON
                         At Fiber Analysis. They say it may 
                         be unique, even traceable -- a long 
                         shot. Sky blue, silk --
                              (to Jude)
                         I seem to remember you were wearing 
                         a tie like that the day of the murder. 
                         A coincidence, but do you remember 
                         by any chance where you bought it?

               Gideon stares at Jude: his tone's innocent but his eyes are 
               ice. Milton shifts uncomfortably; Weiss coughs. Jude, 
               oblivious, wrinkles brow:

                                     JUDE
                         Boy, I can't..., I'll have to check 
                         the label...

                                     MILTON
                         It's all moot anyway. The husband's 
                         gonna confess. I hear it's just a 
                         matter of time. Just like you thought, 
                         a crime of passion.

               Interrogation is heard OFF SCREEN as Jude walks through 
               concrete passageway, turns corner. Gideon, Milton and Weiss 
               follow.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. OBSERVATION ROOM/INTERROGATION ROOM - AFTERNOON

               Mazzo enters tiny OBSERVATION ROOM, stands before one-way 
               mirror. FBI TYPES step back as Milt and Weiss squeeze behind 
               Jude.

               Framed in Interrogation Room mirror, TWO FBI INTERROGATORS 
               grill GEORGES SCHREIBER, 42, Karin's ex-husband -- survivor 
               of three revolutions: sexual, political, drug. He lost all 
               three.

               Gideon bypasses Observation Room, enters INTERROGATION ROOM 
               where Georges sits slumped in lone chair. Jude and others 
               watch through mirror as Interrogators harrangue Georges:

                         Why didn't you divorce your wife?

                         Let's be blunt. Why mince words? 
                         Weren't you a practicing homosexual 
                         at the time you separated from Mrs. 
                         Schreiber?

                         to buy little boys on P Street?

               Interrogators nod to Gideon as he joins them. Georges 
               protests:

                                     GEORGES
                         It wasn't like that. Don't put it 
                         like that. I loved her. I really 
                         did.

                                     FBI INTERROGATOR #1
                              (circling)
                         Is that so?

                                     DECT. GIDEON
                         Make up your mind. You might as well. 
                         We know everything about you.

               Inside OBSERVATION ROOM, Weiss and others watch interrogation 
               like it's a play. Milton whispers to Jude:

                                     MILTON
                         He's trying to get sympathy. He won't 
                         last long.

               BACK IN INTERROGATION ROOM:

                                     DECT. GIDEON
                         Okay, Georges, you're an artist, a 
                         decorator, a sensitive person. We'll 
                         try to help you. Just tell us the 
                         whole story. Slowly, calmly. Start 
                         with the morning your wife Karin was 
                         killed.

                                     GEORGES
                         I already told you.

                                     DECT. GIDEON
                         Tell us again.

                                     GEORGES
                         I had picked up my car. I was back 
                         on the Beltway. You couldn't get 
                         where you were going. Traffic was 
                         backed up, at a standstill --

               In OBSERVATION ROOM, man comments:

                                     FBI TYPE
                         That's the truth.

               In INTERROGATION ROOM, Georges continues:

                                     GEORGES
                         -- millions of cars. Everyone honking 
                         their horns.

               Interrogator #1 snorts with disgust; #2 chuckles: Georges 
               plaintively pans from one to other.

                                     GEORGES
                         I'm answering everything you ask. 
                         I'm telling you everything Honest.

                                     DECT. GIDEON
                              (tough)
                         Hah! Not quite everything. No, you 
                         haven't talked at all about 
                         everything.
                              (grabs Georges' hair)
                         For example, you haven't talked about 
                         how you used your wife to push your 
                         career until she refused. You didn't 
                         tell us that, a friend of yours told 
                         us...

               OBSERVATION ROOM. Mazzo watches as Karin introduces flashback:

                                     KARIN (V.O.)
                         I've got a way to wake you up...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KARIN'S BEDROOM - DAY -FLASHBACK-

               Nine months before. Jude, wearing white dress shirt and jockey 
               shorts, snores face-up on sheets. Karin, in negligee, bends 
               over him, shakes Jude's shoulders.

                                     KARIN
                         ...Third degree me. Get up, do 
                         something. Don't sleep.

                                     JUDE
                         Leave me alone.

                                     KARIN
                         Com'on, I like it when you question 
                         me. You're so suspicious of me -- it 
                         reminds me of my father. Com'on, 
                         third degree me. Interrogate me.

               Mazzo bolts up as Karin pushes something under his nose. He 
               stands, yanks her off bed:

                                     JUDE
                         Alright, first get off the bed. Off 
                         the bed! Now get down on your knees!
                              (pushes her to floor)
                         Straighten up! Straight!

               Jude steps to bureau, lights cigarette, sits with detached 
               cool of experienced interrogator. Karin giggles:

                                     KARIN
                         The silent treatment, right? That 
                         comes first to scare them.

                                     JUDE
                         Straighten up.

               She does. Mazzo walks over, circles her closely, looking 
               askance like a Caesar:

                                     JUDE
                         Now imagine the terrible hours ahead 
                         of you. The cruel questions, the 
                         constant tricks, the threats. 
                         Everything. Try to recall the most 
                         shameful, the dirtiest things you 
                         ever did. Think about the fact that 
                         I will discover all these secrets 
                         because the government offers me the 
                         means to strip you down to anything 
                         I want.
                              (slaps her)
                         Straighten up! You begin to think of 
                         all the hidden sins you've committed. 
                         Your quilt complex takes over.

                                     KARIN
                              (girlish)
                         That's not frightening. Third degree 
                         me. Be my terrorist.

               Jude cradles her face in his hands:

                                     JUDE
                         You want me to interrogate you? To 
                         frighten you?

               Karin nods grinning. He sharply twists her ear; she howls.

                                     JUDE
                         Talk, talk! Tell me your most shameful 
                         secrets. Confess everything, the 
                         little sins you commit everyday. 
                         Then I'll forgive you and protect 
                         you.

                                     KARIN
                              (excited)
                         You treat them like babies.

                                     JUDE
                         Everyone becomes a child again when 
                         confronted by official authority. By 
                         the power that belongs to the police.
                              (slaps her)
                         Sit up straight!
                              (slaps her again)
                         Listen. Don't move. The Law. All 
                         laws, conscious and unconscious laws, 
                         make the accused become like a child.
                              (demented)
                         The accuser becomes the father, the 
                         perfect father that cannot be 
                         attacked, that must be pleased at 
                         any price!
                              (contorts expression)
                         My face starts to be God's face to 
                         you! It's a game staged to touch off 
                         your deepest fears.

               Mazzo glances at Karin's now anxious face. He picks bouquet 
               of dried flowers from wastebasket, speaks in soothing tones:

                                     JUDE
                         Hey, don't look so worried.
                              (sits alongside)
                         I'm trying to explain this whole 
                         mentality because you can't see that 
                         it's the basis, the whole foundation 
                         of official authority. Professors, 
                         doctors, heads of political parties, 
                         even ticket takers.

                                     KARIN
                         You're much more like a child than 
                         any father, believe me, you're --

               Jude muzzles Karin with dead bouquet mid-sentence, pushes 
               her prone to floor:

                                     JUDE
                         You shouldn't have said that. The 
                         others are children. Here...

               Jude arranges flowers around her face, says playfully:

                                     JUDE
                         ...Now I'll show you how we found 
                         that whore in the medical office!

               END OF FLASHBACK

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - AFTERNOON

               Five sweaty Interrogators surround Georges. INTERROGATOR #3, 
               apprentice addition, wipes foggy glasses on sleeve. Georges 
               Schreiber, dehydrated, maintains innocence:

                                     GEORGES
                         -- I just told you --

                                     FBI INTERROGATOR #2
                              (hostile)
                         When you gonna give up that phoney 
                         traffic jam story?

                                     FBI INTERROGATOR #1
                         Fag bullshit.

                                     GEORGES
                         Please, I told you...

               Interrogation's getting nowhere. Gideon backs FBI boys off:

                                     DECT. GIDEON
                         Okay, okay, wait, wait. Let's leave 
                         Mr. Schreiber alone for awhile. All 
                         by yourself. That way you can decide 
                         what you should do. What the truth 
                         is. The rest of you, step out with 
                         me.

               Interrogators leave with Gideon.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. INTERROGATION CORRIDOR - AFTERNOON

               Jude exits Observation Room, joins as Gideon calms 
               Interrogators:

                                     DECT. GIDEON
                         It's alright, take a break...

                                     JUDE
                              (to Gideon)
                         You yell so loud. Why do you guys 
                         yell so loud?

                                     DECT. GIDEON
                              (frustrated)
                         I yell so loud because I learned 
                         from you. Okay?

               Mazzo doesn't answer, walks into Interrogation Room. Gideon 
               waits till Jude's gone:

                                     DECT. GIDEON
                         Why doesn't he mind his own business? 
                         He's got his own agency now.

                                     FBI INTERROGATOR #1
                         He likes to interfere.

                                     DECT. GIDEON
                         Let him try.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - AFTERNOON

               Georges, hunched over, turns as Jude squats beside chair. 
               Mazzo offers cigarette:

                                     JUDE
                         A clich? -- take it anyway.
                              (Georges does)
                         You decorated Ambassador Arburg's 
                         house, right? In Arlington?

               Georges acknowledges as Jude lights trembling cigarette.

                                     JUDE
                         I thought so. All modern -- in a 
                         contemporary way.
                              (Georges flattered)
                         Mr. Schreiber, when was the last 
                         time you saw your wife?

                                     GEORGES
                         Two weeks prior to the murder. But I 
                         was in touch cause I was being 
                         threatened. This man. Somebody who 
                         called.

                                     JUDE
                         Who was he?

                                     GEORGES
                         I don't know. Anonymous phone calls. 
                         He called me late once, twice. He 
                         had the tone of someone who commands 
                         others.

                                     JUDE
                         Why did they do it?

                                     GEORGES
                         They had fun making me suffer. 
                         Humiliating me. I'm so confused. 
                         Maybe I did kill her.

                                     JUDE
                         What did he threaten you with? This 
                         unknown caller?

                                     GEORGES
                         He would say to me, "I'm gonna tell 
                         the cops today you're a transvestite." 
                         I think he's someone important Karin 
                         knew. An army man maybe, I don't 
                         know. Or, or a politician. Some people 
                         said she was a terrorist sympathizer 
                         but she liked any man with lots of 
                         power.

                                     JUDE
                         The name. Tell me what the name is.

                                     GEORGES
                         I don't know. If I did, I wouldn't 
                         be here. That man's the murderer.

                                     JUDE
                              (face to face)
                         So you never knew his name? Right?

                                     GEORGES
                         No. The man never told it.

               Jude offers his hand. Georges takes it, stands.

                                     JUDE
                         You'll be getting out. Don't worry 
                         at all about it.

                                     GEORGES
                              (confused)
                         Thanks.

               Jude walks out.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               They all laugh.

                         You don't mean that?

                         I promise you he's innocent.

               Others watch as he walks off.

               Only a few lights dot the nocturnal complex.

               Jude Mazzo's office window shines particularly bright. THe 
               others have gone appropriately home.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. JUDE'S NATA OFFICE - NIGHT

               Jude listens to cheap tape cassette player as he does sit-
               ups. He's alone with moment of truth:

               Jude cuts off tape, continues confession from memory, his

               Jude rewinds, echos confession from memory, his arms swinging:

               EXT. L'ENFANT PLAZA - LATE NIGHT

               Mazzo, clutching bulky 8x14 envelope, walks briskly across 
               L'Enfant Plaza in south Washington. Square red granite 
               structures enclose sterile courtyard. I.M. Pei's International 
               Style complex is empty by night, eerie as Ozymandias.

               Jude passes fountain lit by yellow globes, stops outside 
               Postal Service West Building; he places stamped/addressed 
               enevelope in mail box, enters deluxe L'Enfant Plaza Hotel.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. L'ENFANT HOTEL LOBBY - LATE NIGHT

               Jude dials from phone cubicle in deserted ostentatious 
               "concourse." He hovers over receiver, places handkerchief to 
               mouth as call RINGS in earpiece. Sam Zegner, hotshot reporter 
               from scene 30, answers sleepily:

                                     SAM (O.S.)
                         Yes?

                                     JUDE
                              (disguises voice)
                         Sam Zegner? Crime desk?

                                     SAM (O.S.)
                         Yeah, who's this?

                                     JUDE
                         I can't tell you who this is. They've 
                         got my phone tapped.

                                     SAM (O.S.)
                         Is this a joke or what?

                                     JUDE
                         Listen. D.C. Homicide will tomorrow 
                         receive an envelope containing the 
                         necklace of the murdered woman Karin 
                         Schreiber, the killer's razor blade. 
                         That rules out the husband.

                                     SAM (O.S.)
                         Why are you trying to disguise your 
                         voice? I recognized you right away.

               Jude quickly hangs up, heart pounding, face flushed.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. COMPUTER CENTER - DAY

               NATA's nerve center is fully operational. Rows of isolated 
               young men and women work silently in computer cubicles. Some 
               replay wiretap tapes on headphones; others enter data, take 
               notes.

               Jude and Alan check out cubicles as they stride toward 
               supercomputer. Pretty programmer in Fair Isle sweater glances 
               at Jude flirtatiously, returns to monitor. Victor and Computer 
               Technician work at Big Moma console.

                                     JUDE
                              (to Alan)

                         terrorism, pornography, drugs, who 
                         will? The Civil Liberties Union? The 
                         press? The ASPCA? Of course we have 
                         personal rights -- society has greater 
                         rights! Society has the right to 
                         defend itself by whatever means 
                         necessary. Whatever means necessary.

               Mazzo interrupts Victor:

                                     JUDE
                         The new taps should be in -- huh, 
                         Victor?

                                     VICTOR
                         About half, Director, but please, 
                         don't take on more taps without 
                         additional staff. We're backlogged. 
                         We just label and file most of them. 
                         Look --

               Vic punches out successive screens of coded info: phone 
               numbers, initials, dates, etc.

                                     VICTOR
                         These are just the current taps. 
                         There's a million hours in storage, 
                         known but to God. We pulled and 
                         collated the Ria Maled taps you 
                         wanted. About 30 hours. The most 
                         recent two days ago. They're in your 
                         office. Great office, by the way, 
                         Director.

               VOICE calls "Director Mazzo." Jude turns as Lt. Weiss 
               approaches, tabloid in hand. Avery Milton follows at distance. 
               Weiss catches his breath:

                                     LT. WEISS
                         The killer went to the press. They 
                         were tipped before we got the evidence --

                                     MILTON
                              (enthused)
                         The reporter's home phone was on 
                         your tap list. Can you believe such 
                         luck? They're locating it now.

               Jude just nods, walks away.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. JUDE'S NATA OFFICE - DAY

               Mazzo's new office is even hipper than last: Casa Vogue wall 
               to wall. Memphis chair, painted D.C. map, framed photos and 
               faded pennant are integrated into Neo-Classical decor. One 
               wall's inexplicably barren.

               Jude examines log as phone wiretap plays on cassette deck. 
               Weiss and Milton, standing, listen to Ria Maled speak bad 
               audio with young Hispanic later known as Tomas:

                                     TOMAS (O.S.)
                         Ria, where have you been? I've been 
                         trying to reach you.

                                     RIA (O.S.)
                         I was at police headquarters all 
                         morning. They were questioning me 
                         about Karin's murder.

                                     TOMAS (O.S.)
                         Did they know anything?

                                     RIA (O.S.)
                         No, they were questioning all the 
                         residents of the building.

                                     TOMAS (O.S.)
                         Not even that you'd slept with her?

                         Shut up! Don't you know my phone's 
                         bugged? -- and now that I'm on the 
                         point, I'd like to speak to the cops 
                         that are listening. One cop in 
                         particular. Comrade Officer, you 
                         have the disgusting job of spying on 
                         Third World liberation -- which you 
                         call "terrorism." Give up! You're 
                         doomed to fail --

                                     JUDE
                              (rising)
                         Enough! Shut it off!

               Milton cuts off tape. Jude looks out window as Karin's VOICE 
               segues to flashback:

                                     KARIN (V.O.)
                              (cruel)
                         You're disgusting. Will you throw 
                         away that undershirt?...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KARIN'S BEDROOM - DAY -FLASHBACK-

               Nine months before. Karin, nearly naked, belittles Jude as 
               she applies mascara. He buttons white shirt over undershirt, 
               pulls on black nylon socks. His shirt's worn from repeated 
               washings.

                                     KARIN
                         ...Everything you wear is impossible. 
                         Don't worry, I won't tell your mother. 
                         And change that shirt. You look like 
                         a head waiter. And those little black 
                         socks you wear like a priest. Or 
                         like what you really are, a policeman. 
                         Don't you have a suit with style? A 
                         bit brighter? With some life to it?

               Mazzo hides behind hard expression:

                                     JUDE
                              (curt)
                         No.

                                     KARIN
                         People cross the street when they 
                         see you coming because they can tell 
                         you're a cop. You police stink of 
                         barracks, jails, courtrooms. Priests 
                         at least smell like incense. They 
                         ought to pass out a deodorant to the 
                         police and teach them to use it.

               Karin crosses room as Jude knots cheap black tie. She picks 
               up scissors, approaches Jude, cuts his tie slowly. Once, 
               then twice. She kisses his blank face, walks to mirror. Mazzo 
               waits to speak:

                                     JUDE
                         I could kill you. With my own two 
                         hands.

                                     KARIN
                              (combing hair)
                         Who'd catch you? You'd control the 
                         investigation.

               END OF FLASHBACK

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. JUDE'S NATA OFFICE - DAY

               Same day as previous office scene. Mazzo, Milton, Weiss and 
               Alan listen to wiretap conversation. Jude's muffled phone 
               voice speaks from L'Enfant lobby:

                                     JUDE (O.S.)
                         ...an envelope containing the necklace 
                         of the murdered woman Karin 
                         Schreiber...

               Weiss turns to others:

                                     LT. WEISS
                         Listen. Who does this remind you of?

                                     JUDE
                         Sam Zegner?

                                     LT. WEISS
                         Yes, but the other?

                                     JUDE
                              (shrugs)
                         Where's the envelope he's talking 
                         about?

                                     MILTON
                         FBI.

                                     LT. WEISS
                         Gideon pulled rank. They were all 
                         over us after the story hit.

                                     JUDE
                         That's it either way. That proves 
                         the husband's innocent.

                                     MILTON
                         Just like you said. He'll be released.

                                     LT. WEISS
                              (shakes head)
                         Gideon won't do it. He says he's in 
                         charge of the case and he's holding 
                         him and that's that.

                                     JUDE
                         The man is innocent.

               EXT. NATA HDQRS - EVENING

               Mazzo waves off Alan:

                                     JUDE
                         ...didn't need security before, don't 
                         need it now!
                              (jocular)
                         Wouldn't I be a hell of a hostage?

               Jude laughs heads for assigned space where Beretta sits washed 
               and polished. Sam Zegner, lying in wait, intercepts Mazzo.

               They inch toward Jude's metallic coupe.

                                     JUDE
                         Sam, what -- ?

                                     SAM
                         Did you read my story on the Schreiber 
                         necklace?
                              (Jude nods)
                         What should I tell him?

                                     JUDE
                         Tell who?

                                     SAM
                         Detective Gideon at the FBI.

                                     JUDE
                         Tell him about what?

                                     SAM
                         He wants me to tell him who tipped 
                         me about the envelope. You understand.

                                     JUDE
                         Why are you asking me?

                                     SAM
                         You made that phone call.

                                     JUDE
                         Don't be stupid. How could I call 
                         before the package even arrived?

                                     SAM
                         But you made the call!

               Jude stops beside Beretta, flares back at young reporter:

                                     JUDE
                         Don't you ever say a thing like that! 
                         That I call you! I never call you!

                                     SAM
                              (vacillates)
                         But --

                                     JUDE
                              (opens door)
                         I do favors for you, you know. So 
                         you just watch out.

               Sam retreats as Director Mazzo sits in coupe, slams door, 
               starts engine. Zegner's mind reels with rationalizations as 
               Jude drives down 24th. File this "Forgotten."

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BERETTA - EVENING

               Jude sits behind wheel in cold sweat, suddenly frightened. 
               He regulates his breathing: in-out, in-out, calming down. Is 
               Jude's cool his cover? Or his turn-on?

               Karin's hand flashes before his face as TRAFFIC NOISE 
               dissolves to flashback.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. PENNSYLVANIA AVE. - DAY -FLASHBACK-

               Six months before. Jude's MOVING POV through Beretta 
               windshield: Karin's hand pulls away, revealing thoroughfare 
               running deadend to Rotunda Dome. Pennsylvania Avenue, nation's 
               #1 drag strip, stretches from White House to Capitol Hill. 
               Rod Stewart sings over dashboard speakers: "Do You Think I'm 
               Sexy?"

               Mazzo wearing wraparound sunglasses, glances from side mirror 
               to rearview to windshield. He breaks for red light. Black 
               TRAFFIC OFFICER in white uniform watches intersection from 
               far curb.

               Karin leans to lightly kiss Jude, whispers teasingly:

                                     KARIN
                         Go ahead. Go ahead, run it. You can 
                         do it...
