                      Stanford Sherman










                                    <u>3rd Draft, November 1980</u>










<u>FADE IN</u>:

<u>EXT. FOREST</u> - JUST BEFORE DAWN

Mail-clad HORSEMEN gallop headlong through the dark, bent
low over their saddles. A bestial <u>scream</u> is heard, and
suddenly a saddle is empty, the rider sprawled face down in
a pool of blood.

At the head of the band, COLWYN, a boy of twenty-two, raises
his shield to ward off an unseen assailant. We hear a
horrendous <u>tearing</u> sound, and Colwyn's father, TUROLD,
riding beside him, looks over at the boy. Colwyn is unharmed
- but his shield is <u>deeply gouged</u>, as if by a <u>huge claw</u>.

<u>EXT. PARAPET OF WHITE CASTLE</u> - DAWN

A GUARD sees the band of warriors emerge from the forest.

                        GUARD
               (shouts)
            Open the gate!

<u>EXT. APPROACH TO WHITE CASTLE</u> - DAWN

The warriors gallop toward the main gate of the castle.
Though their arms and armor are reminiscent of the Middle
Ages on Earth, this is not Earth ...

<u>TWIN SUNRISE</u>

Behind the riders, TWO SUNS rise above the horizon.

<u>EXT. MAIN GATE OF WHITE CASTLE</u> - DAWN

Turold and Colwyn lead their men through the gate and
dismount. Waiting for them are LORD ROWAN, a man of Turold's
age, and an elderly COUNCILOR. Rowan notices the gouges in
Colwyn's shield.

                        ROWAN
               (to Turold)
            You were attacked in the forest?

                        TUROLD
            Yes. We lost five.

                        ROWAN
            You were lucky. I lost thirty there.

<u>INT. CORRIDOR IN WHITE CASTLE</u> - DAY

Turold and Rowan walk down the corridor, followed by Colwyn
and the Councilor.

                        ROWAN
            I tried to reach Ynyr, the old one.
            I led a hundred men to his place in
            Granite Needle, but it was
            surrounded. The Dark Ones guard it
            by night and by day they call out
            the Slayers. Ynyr cannot get out and
            no one can get in.

                        TUROLD
            How many did you lose?

                        ROWAN
            Sixty at the needle, another thirty
            in the forest. Only ten of us made
            it back.

                        TUROLD
            We will have to try again. His
            knowledge is great. Without it, we
            cannot hope to win.

<u>INT. QUEEN'S BEDROOM</u> - DAY

The QUEEN is propped up in bed, eyes closed, head tilted
back. Her crown, a jeweled tiara, rests in her lap. She is
attended by two GIRLS-IN-WAITING, one of whom sponges her
forehead with a damp cloth. The Queen opens her eyes as the
elderly Councilor enters.

                        COUNCILOR
            Lord Turold and his son, my lady.

The Queen hands her tiara to one of the girls-in-waiting,
who places it on her head. Then she nods, and the Councilor
admits Turold and Colwyn, followed by Rowan. The three
kneel.

                        QUEEN
            He has turned out well.

Turold stands and looks down at Colwyn with an affectionate
smile.

                        TUROLD
            Middling well.

Colwyn stands and we see that he is several inches taller
than his father.

                        TUROLD
            Though a touch too tall for <u>my</u>
            taste.

Colwyn smiles somewhat sheepishly.

                        QUEEN
               (to Colwyn)
            My daughter is in the north tower.
            Go to her.

                        COLWYN
               (flustered)
            In my armor?

                        QUEEN
            If she's to marry a warrior, she'd
            best get used to it.

Colwyn bows his head and leaves. The three men approach the
Queen.

                        QUEEN
            What news from our friends?

                        TUROLD
            Barak is still strong in the north,
            and Tendo holds the high passes. But
            the great desert forts have fallen.

                        QUEEN
            Freylag's stronghold?

                        TUROLD
            It has been taken, Freylag and all
            his people slaughtered.

                        QUEEN
            It is only a few weeks and already
            half our strong places have fallen.

                        TUROLD
            The attacks are unceasing: by night,
            the Dark Ones; by day, those of our
            people who have sold themselves to
            them, those traitors who are called
            the Slayers.

                        QUEEN
            It is the way of all invaders. Those
            they would conquer they divide,
            buying allies with promises of land
            and power.

                        TUROLD
            We will hold. Their power is not
            unlimited.

<u>EXT. GLOOMY FOREST ROAD</u> - DAY

Two mounted SLAYERS ride along the road. Their horses and
armor are black, as are their cylindrical, flat-topped
helmets, pierced with a T-slot for vision. Their weapons are
long-swords and maces.

Two more Slayers ride out of the forest and join the black
column. At a road up ahead wait three more, who swing in
behind the column as it passes.

Forest noises die at the Slayers' approach; the only sounds
we hear are the clink of metal and the heavy thud of the
horses' hooves.

<u>INT. TOWER STAIRCASE</u> - DAY

Colwyn mounts a narrow, circular staircase toward a wooden
door.

<u>INT. TOWER ROOM</u> - INTERCUT

LYSSA, the Queen's seventeen-year-old daughter, stares
across the circular room at the wooden door, listening to
Colwyn's approaching footsteps.

The door swings open and Colwyn enters. They stare at each
other for several moments: Colwyn, dusty and disheveled in
his armor, Lyssa freshly scrubbed and glowing in a
diaphanous gown.

                        COLWYN
               (nervous)
            I'm Colwyn.

Lyssa nods, noncommittal. They start to circle the room,
eyes fixed on each other, like a pair of nervous cats.

                        COLWYN
               (plaintive)
            Are you Lyssa?

She gives him another noncommittal nod. They resume their
tentative circling.

Suddenly, Lyssa turns away, leaning on the sill of a narrow
window. Her shoulders begin to heave, as if she's sobbing.
Colwyn is in agony; he rushes across the room to her.

                        COLWYN
            I don't care what arrangements were
            made by our parents. You don't have
            to go through with it!

Lyssa continues to heave.

                        COLWYN
            They can't force you. I won't let
            them!

Lyssa turns around, and Colwyn sees that she's not sobbing,
but <u>laughing</u>.

                        LYSSA
               (trying to control her
                laughter)
            I'm sorry. I couldn't help it.

                        COLWYN
               (taking considerable umbrage)
            I don't have to go through with it
            either.

                        LYSSA
               (still laughing, touches his
                arm)
            You don't understand. I'm just so
            <u>relieved</u>. I was <u>sure</u> you'd turn out
            to be short and fat and gimpy.

                        COLWYN
            Oh. That.
               (begins to chuckle)
            I know what you mean.
               (sits down on a bench)
            I had nightmares all week.

                        LYSSA
               (sits down beside him)
            Me too.

                        COLWYN
            Last night was the worst. I dreamt
            you had one leg shorter than the
            other, and walked like a penguin.

                        LYSSA
            Mine was worse: I dreamt you picked
            your nose in public.

                        COLWYN
            That's worse.

                        LYSSA
            You're really not bad looking.
            Almost handsome.

                        COLWYN
            Well, you're beautiful.

                        LYSSA
            You <u>might</u> be handsome. I can't tell
            through all that grime. Besides, you
            reek of sweat and horses.

                        COLWYN
               (pompously)
            If you're going to marry a warrior,
            you'd best get used to it.

                        LYSSA
            I have no intention of getting used
            to it.

She goes over to a small cistern and fills a wooden bucket.

                        LYSSA
            Take off your clothes. I'm going to
            scrub you down.

                        COLWYN
               (aghast)
            <u>What</u>?

                        LYSSA
            We're almost married.

                        COLWYN
            We're not married <u>yet</u>.

                        LYSSA
            Well, then you can go up to the
            parapet and I'll hand the buckets up
            to you.

Colwyn looks at the stone stairs leading to the top of the
tower.

                        COLWYN
            Do I have to?
               (looks at Lyssa, sighs)
            I have to.

He starts up the stairs.

<u>EXT. ROAD CROSSING</u> - DAY

A column of mounted Slayers waits at the crossing for
another column to reach the intersection. The first column
falls in beside the second as it passes, forming a double
column.

Farther down the road waits LORD MODRED, a Slayer like the
others, but distinguished by the leopard embroidered on his
chest and by his lance, which bears a pennon affixed to its
head: ermine, a leopard courant sable. As the double column
reaches him, he wheels and leads them down the road, lance
upright.

<u>INT. QUEEN'S BEDROOM</u> - DAY

Turold and Rowan at the Queen's bedside.

                        QUEEN
            Lord Rowan is one of Lyssa's
            godfathers. He will defend her in
            the ceremony. I wish that Lord
            Modred were here. He is a godfather
            of her own blood.

                        TUROLD
            Modred has treated with the Dark
            Ones.

                        ROWAN
            Modred! Impossible!

                        TUROLD
            He leads a group of Slayers, under
            the leopard banner.

                        QUEEN
            For some, the lure of power is
            stronger than the ties of blood. No
            matter. I had hoped to have the
            wedding next spring, Lord Turold,
            with all the nobles of the kingdom
            in attendance. But Fate and this war
            have ordained otherwise.

                        TUROLD
            It is important to assure the
            succession.

                        QUEEN
            Yes.

The Queen smiles and beckons Turold closer. He kneels beside
the bed.

                        QUEEN
            I will tell you something you did
            not know, Turold. Had it been my
            choice, all those years ago, I would
            have chosen you for my king. But my
            parents chose otherwise.

                        TUROLD
            I knew.

                        QUEEN
            You knew! You are a rude bumpkin!

                        TUROLD
               (smiles)
            That I am, my lady.

Turold looks out the window at the North Tower.

                        TUROLD
            And, it seems, so is my son.

<u>P.O.V. - NORTH TOWER</u> - INTERCUT

Angle from the Queen's bedroom window. A waist-high wall
conceals the bottom half of a naked Colwyn, who stands atop
the tower, hugging himself in the brisk wind.

<u>EXT. TOP OF NORTH TOWER</u> - INTERCUT

Colwyn hears Lyssa mounting the stairs and moves to the
doorway, reaching around to take the bucket from her.

                        COLWYN
               (as Lyssa pushes past him)
            Just hand me the bucket! What are
            you doing!

He backs away, covering himself with his hands. Lyssa
advances on him; tucked in her belt, like a sword, is a
long-handled bath brush.

                        LYSSA
            I don't trust you to wash behind
            your ears.

                        COLWYN
            Never mind my ears! Go away!

The Queen and Turold watch the unfolding drama from their
window vantage point: a great tongue of water leaps across
the tower as Lyssa heaves the bucketful at Colwyn. Dripping
wet, he retreats, but is soon cornered and attacked without
quarter, Lyssa wielding brush and soap with gleeful
enthusiasm. At one point, Colwyn squirms free and, with his
head completely enveloped in lather, tries to flee. But
since he can't see, he soon fetches up against a wall, and
Lyssa continues her scrubbing.

<u>RESUME - QUEEN'S BEDROOM</u>

                        TUROLD
            A girl of some spirit, your
            daughter.

                        QUEEN
            A match for your son, I think.

                        TUROLD
            A fine match.

                        QUEEN
               (takes his hand)
            They will have the life that you and
            I might have had.

<u>EXT. TOP OF NORTH TOWER</u> - DAY

Wrapped in a long blue cape, a scrubbed and scowling Colwyn
stands with arms folded across his chest. Lyssa is combing
his hair.

                        LYSSA
               (steps back)
            There. Now you look like someone I
            might want to marry.

                        COLWYN
               (surly growl)
            Maybe you'd better look around for
            another candidate. I don't think my
            skin is tough enough to survive a
            lifetime of you and your brush.

                        LYSSA
            I don't have to look around. I've
            found the husband I want. You can
            kiss me now.

                        COLWYN
            Thank you, but I can wait.

                        LYSSA
            I can't.

She bestows a class-A smack.

                        COLWYN
            I lied.

                        LYSSA
            About what?

                        COLWYN
            I can't wait either.

They close in a passionate kiss, and begin caressing each
other. We see Turold standing in the doorway, watching them.

                        TUROLD
            You'll both wait. At least for five
            hours. The wedding is at three.

                        COLWYN
               (acting offended)
            It was a platonic kiss, Father.

                        TUROLD
            Of course it was.

Turold snorts down a laugh. Colwyn and Lyssa begin to
giggle. Then all three break into laughter.

<u>EXT. COURTYARD OF WHITE CASTLE</u> - DAY

The occupants of the castle - servants, soldiers, minor
nobles, and retainers - stand in two parallel lines, forming
an aisle.

Turold and Rowan, on horseback, face each other at opposite
ends of the aisle. Midway between them stand Colwyn and
Lyssa, side by side, Colwyn facing Rowan, Lyssa facing
Turold. The two fathers are not armored, but they hold
longswords balanced across their pommels.

Colwyn glances up toward the Queen's balcony.

<u>EXT. QUEEN'S BALCONY</u> - INTERCUT

The Queen lies on a couch, attended by her two girls-in-
waiting. She answers Colwyn's look with a nod.

                        COLWYN
               (shouts to Rowan)
            I am Colwyn, son of Turold, of the
            eagle's blood, and I am come to take
            your daughter from you.

                        ROWAN
               (shouts)
            You shall not!

                        LYSSA
               (shouts to Turold)
            I am Lyssa, daughter of the Queen,
            of the leopard's blood, and I am
            come to take your son from you.

                        TUROLD
               (shouts)
            You shall not!

The two men spur their horses toward the wedding couple, who
stand perfectly still as the horses thunder down on them.
Turold and Rowan swing their swords directly above the heads
of the young couple, the blades striking with a <u>clang</u>. Then
they wheel their horses to a stop. Colwyn and Lyssa, almost
obscured by the whirling dust, have not moved a muscle.

                        TUROLD
            Let it be done then.

He hurls his sword at the ground beside the wedding couple.

                        ROWAN
            It is done.

He hurls his sword, which sticks in the ground beside
Turold's, crossing it. A cheer goes up from the spectators
and the guards on the walls.

As Colwyn and Lyssa kiss, a crossbow bolt strikes one of the
guards, who topples thirty feet to the courtyard below.
Slayers appear around the walls, leaping over the parapet
and attacking the guards.

                        TUROLD
               (shouts)
            Slayers! To arms!

Men and women arm themselves as Slayers descend the walls.
They mount a fierce counterattack against the Slayers, women
fighting beside their men, Lyssa fighting beside Colwyn.

But suddenly the main gate is rammed open and a dozen
Slayers on horseback, led by Modred, attack the defenders
from the rear. In the melee, Colwynn and Lyssa are
separated.

<u>EXT. QUEEN'S BALCONY</u> - DAY

The Queen and her girls hear Slayers forcing the door to her
bedroom within.

                        QUEEN
            Help me up. I will die on my feet.

The two girls help the Queen to stand. She faces the door
defiantly as it bursts open. A Slayer steps into the
bedroom.

                        QUEEN
            And I will not die alone.

She hurls a knife, which pierces the Slayer's throat. But
even as he falls, three more Slayers enter the room and
advance on the three women, who stare back defiantly.

<u>EXT. COURTYARD OF WHITE CASTLE</u> - DAY

Colwyn sees that his father is being pressed by several
Slayers and hacks his way to his side. They dispatch their
assailants, then Colwyn looks through the courtyard for
Lyssa, who has just run a Slayer through with her short
sword, when she is felled from behind by Modred's mailed
fist. He picks her up and lays her across his saddle.

                        COLWYN
            They have Lyssa!

                        TUROLD
            You can't reach her!
               (opens a door in the wall)
            Through the door.
               (as Colwyn hesitates)
            Quickly!

They go through the door, and are followed shortly by two
Slayers.

<u>INT. CORRIDOR IN WALL OF WHITE CASTLE</u> - DAY

Colwyn and Turold back down the dark corridor, fighting the
two Slayers. They kill the Slayers but, in the exchange,
Turold is badly wounded. He leans against the wall, holding
himself erect by force of will.

                        TUROLD
            The passage. Open it.

Colwyn pressed one of the rough-hewn stones and a door
swings open in the wall: A staircase leads to an underground
passage. He moves to help his father through the door.

                        TUROLD
               (shaking his head)
            You will go alone.

                        COLWYN
            I won't leave you here.

                        TUROLD
            You will do as I tell you. You will
            try to reach Ynyr, the old one.

                        COLWYN
            I must follow the Slayers. They've
            taken Lyssa.

                        TUROLD
               (sharply)
            You will not follow the Slayers, you
            will obey my command!
               (softer)
            You have no chance alone, boy. You
            must try to break through to Ynyr.
            He has great knowledge. Only with
            his help can you save Lyssa.

They hear footsteps in the corridor.

                        TUROLD
            Go now.
               (as Colwyn hesitates)
            Go! I command you!

As Colwyn enters the passage and begins swinging the heavy
door shut, Modred appears, advancing on Turold with drawn
sword. Turold places himself in front of the door, but he is
weak from his wound and goes down under Modred's first blow.
Modred thrusts his sword into the crack of the door,
preventing it from closing. Turold, slumped against the
wall, looks up at him with pleading eyes.

                        TUROLD
            Spare him, Modred. Have you never
            loved anyone?

                        MODRED
               (after a pause)
            If I spare him, they will kill me.

                        TUROLD
            He is your godson now. He and Lyssa
            were married.

Modred stares at him for some moments, then withdraws his
sword, allowing the door to close. Turold flashes a look of
gratitude, then dies.

<u>EXT. COURTYARD OF WHITE CASTLE</u> - DAY

The castle is in flames, the occupants slain.

The Slayers, mounted, wait in a double column for Modred's
command. Lyssa sits on a horse in the middle of the column,
her hands tied behind her. Modred approaches her with a skin
canteen of water, which she refuses by averting her face. He
steps back and signals the column, which trots out through
the main gate.

As Modred mounts his horse to follow the column, the twin
suns dip below the horizon. Modred rides through the main
gate, disappearing in the shadows. We hear an inhuman
<u>scream</u>, amplified by the stone walls of the gate.

Modred's riderless horse emerges from the other side of the
gate. A new angle shows Modred lying on the stone floor
beneath the gate tower, his chest raked by <u>deep gouges</u>.

<u>EXT. WOODS NEAR WHITE CASTLE</u> - NIGHT

Colwyn stands beside the exit of the underground passage,
tears running down his cheeks as he stares at the burning
castle in the distance.

<u>EXT. FOREST NEAR GRANITE NEEDLE</u> - DAY

The forest ends abruptly, some distance from the edge of a
steep cliff. A natural stone bridge arches from the cliff to
the Granite Needle, a cylindrical formation that rises from
the floor of the valley below.

Colwyn stands at the edge of the forest, looking out at a
group of Slayers posted near the stone bridge. Nearby are a
pair of black tents housing more Slayers.

He hears a noise and turns to see a Slayer behind him,
drawing his sword. As the Slayer rushes, Colwyn hurls his
knife at the T-slot in the Slayer's cylindrical helmet,
striking him between the eyes.

<u>EXT. GRANITE NEEDLE</u> - DAY

Colwyn, wearing the dead Slayer's helmet and armor,
approaches the group near the stone bridge. The bridge leads
to an opening in the side of the Needle, which gives access
to a passage which extends some ten feet into the Needle
before it takes a right-angle turn.

On the floor of the passage are heaped the bodies of half a
dozen Slayers; though Ynyr may not be able to get out, he is
clearly capable of preventing anyone from getting in.

                        COLWYN
            The old man must sleep sometime.

                        SLAYER
            Yes, sometime. But when?

                        COLWYN
            Perhaps now.

                        SLAYER
            Perhaps you'd like to stroll across
            the bridge and find out.

                        COLWYN
            Perhaps I will.

                        2ND SLAYER
            Go right ahead, brother, and let the
            old man put you to sleep forever ...
               (nods toward bodies)
            ... along with them.

The Slayers laugh, but fall silent as Colwyn draws his sword
and starts across the bridge.

He moves across the bridge into the passageway, stepping
over bodies as he nears the right-angle turn.

<u>INT. CAVE IN GRANITE NEEDLE</u> - INTERCUT - DAY

Ynyr stares down the passage toward the right-angle turn. In
his hand, held out before him, is a <u>silver glaive</u>, a cross-
shaped weapon with four equal blades.

When Colwyn rounds the corner into view, the glaive leaps
from the old man's hand and spins down the passageway.

                        COLWYN
               (pulling off his helmet)
            I am Colwyn, son of Turold!

The glaive stops in midair, inches from Colwyn's throat.

Realizing they've been tricked, two Slayers start across the
bridge to attack Colwyn. But the old man projects his glaive
past the boy, where it hangs in midair, spinning and
glowing. The Slayers retreat.

                        SLAYER
            There is no way out. He will die
            there with the old man.

In the cave, Colwyn stands in front of Ynyr.

                        COLWYN
            The White Castle has fallen.

                        YNYR
            Does the Queen live?

                        COLWYN
            The new Queen lives.

                        YNYR
            Turold's son was to marry her.

                        COLWYN
            We were married. Then she was taken
            by the Slayers. You must help me.

                        YNYR
            I have lived in this place, like my
            fathers before me, guarding the old
            knowledge. I knew, when I had no
            son, that the Great War would come
            in my time, and that I would be the
            one to pass on the old knowledge to
            a new king. Come.

Colwyn glances toward the entrance.

                        YNYR
            It is night. The Slayers have gone
            to their tents and the bridge is
            guarded by Dark Ones. They will not
            cross, for they have no power in
            this place.

Colwyn follows Ynyr through a passageway to ...

<u>INT. TRIANGULAR ROOM IN GRANITE NEEDLE</u> - NIGHT

Colwyn and Ynyr sit beside a fire in a triangular pit in the
floor. Colwyn has shed the Slayer's armor, and Ynyr holds a
black onyx box in his lap.

                        YNYR
            This is not the first time the Dark
            Ones have attacked our world. They
            came once before, a thousand years
            ago. A young king and queen, with
            extraordinary powers, were given to
            us then, to lead the struggle. My
            fore-father was their Councilor, as
            I will be yours.

                        COLWYN
            I have no extraordinary powers.

                        YNYR
            Your powers are greater than you
            know.
               (indicates his glaive)
            Have you ever seen one of these?

                        COLWYN
            In the old books. It's called a
            glaive.

Ynyr opens the onyx box to reveal a <u>golden glaive</u>.

                        YNYR
            This belonged to the young king who
            fought the Dark Ones a thousand
            years ago. Now it is yours.

Colwyn picks up the glaive, turns it in his hands, the
blades flashing in the firelight.

                        YNYR
            With two or three days' practice,
            you'll be able to use it as well as
            I can. Then we'll have a chance of
            fighting our way out of here.

                        COLWYN
            Two or three days! While Lyssa is in
            their hands?

                        YNYR
            There is no other way.

                        COLWYN
               (looks at the fire)
            But there is another entrance to
            this place.

Ynyr follows Colwyn's gaze and sees that he's judging from
the movement of the flames.

                        YNYR
            Yes.

<u>INT. TUNNEL IN GRANITE NEEDLE</u> - NIGHT

                        YNYR
            But it opens onto the sheer wall of
            the Needle. There's no way down.

                        COLWYN
            You have rope?

                        YNYR
            I am too old to climb down a rope.

                        COLWYN
            You won't have to.

<u>EXT. OPENING IN WALL OF GRANITE NEEDLE</u> - NIGHT

Colwyn inserts his glaive in a crack beside the opening,
then ties a rope to the glaive and climbs down the wall.

<u>EXT. BOTTOM OF GRANITE NEEDLE</u> - INTERCUT - NIGHT

Colwyn reaches the ground and signals Ynyr, who unties the
rope from the glaive and secures it around his waist. Then
he lowers the rope over the glaive, which allows Colwyn to
lower him down the side of the Needle.

<u>EXT. NEARBY CLIFF</u> - INTERCUT - NIGHT

A Dark One watches them from the top of the cliff, its red
eyes peering over the edge. The thing moves quickly down the
rock face, with only an occasional scrape or flash of claw
to mark its descent.

At the bottom of the cliff, the red eyes appear above a rock
- only a few yards from Colwyn. But before it can attack, a
<u>trident</u> flashes through the air and strikes the thing square
in the face, the outer prongs of the weapon piercing the red
eyes. We hear a death grunt, then the sound of a body
falling.

Colwyn turns, but sees nothing. He lowers Ynyr to the ground
and they set off across the valley floor.

<u>EXT. FOREST CLEARING</u> - JUST BEFORE DAWN

The golden glaive stands upright on Colwyn's outstretched
palm. Ynyr kneels beside him.

                        YNYR
            Focus on the glaive.

Colwyn tenses with concentration. The glaive begins to spin,
at first slowly, then faster and faster until it's a golden
blur.

                        YNYR
            Reach out with your mind. Reach out
            to Lyssa.

Colwyn furrows his brow in concentration.

<u>COLWYN'S TELEPATHIC SEARCH</u> - INTERCUT

Through a translucent image of Lyssa we see stretches of
terrain moving past: bizarre forests and valleys, gargoyle
mountains, rainbow lakes.

                        COLWYN
               (sweating)
            There is nothing.

                        YNYR
            Reach out farther. Call to her.

                        COLWYN (OVER)
            Lyssa ... Lyssa ...

<u>EXT. FORTRESS OF KRULL, IN THE MOUNTAINS</u> - JUST BEFORE DAWN

A LONG SHOT SHOWS only a series of jagged peaks, but as we
MOVE IN, we SEE the outlines of a gigantic fortress,
designed to blend into the mountains.

Lyssa walks along the parapets of the fortress, a cold wind
whipping at her light garments. The occasional glint of
talon or beak, the quick flash of a red eye, tell us that
she is closely watched and guarded.

                        COLWYN (OVER)
               (faintly at first, then
                louder)
            Lyssa ... Lyssa ...

                        LYSSA (OVER)
            Colwyn.

<u>INTERCUT COLWYN AND LYSSA</u>

                        COLWYN (OVER)
            Have they harmed you?

                        LYSSA (OVER)
            No. They watch me closely, but they
            haven't harmed me.

                        YNYR
               (to Colwyn)
            Where? We must know where she is.

Colwyn's face is bathed in sweat, his hand clenched tight.

                        COLWYN (OVER)
            Lyssa. Where are they keeping you?

                        LYSSA (OVER)
            In a great fortress in the
            mountains. Wait. Something's
            happening.

As the twin suns edge above the horizon, the fortress fades
and disappears. The whistle of the wind changes to ...

<u>EXT. FORTRESS OF KRULL, IN THE JUNGLE</u> - DAWN

... tropical bird sounds as the Fortress appears in the
midst of the jungle, its walls covered with liana vines.

                        LYSSA (OVER)
            Everything's changed. Now the
            fortress is in the jungle.

Colwyn's body is shaking from the strain of maintaining
contact. Ynyr grips his shoulder.

                        YNYR
            Enough, boy.

But Colwyn continues to concentrate.

                        YNYR
            Enough!

Ynyr <u>slaps</u> him sharply, knocking him backward. The boy lies
exhausted, breathing heavily.

                        YNYR
            You must break when the strain
            becomes too great, or you will harm
            yourself. And you must concentrate
            your powers for when they are needed
            most. What did she answer?

                        COLWYN
            She was in a great fortress, first
            in the mountains, then in the
            jungle. How is that possible?

                        YNYR
            It is the Fortress of Krull. I know
            it only from the stories of wars on
            other worlds. They did not use it on
            our world in the first great war,
            for it costs them enormous power.
            This time they mean to conquer, at
            all costs.

                        COLWYN
            The Fortress moves?

                        YNYR
            Yes. Each dawn it rises in a
            different land: sometimes in the
            mountains, sometimes in the jungle,
            sometimes the desert, sometimes the
            sea. Never in the same place twice.

                        COLWYN
            Then even if Lyssa tells us where
            she is, we'll never be able to reach
            her, for they will never allow the
            Fortress to rise near us.

                        YNYR
            No. They occupy the Fortress, but
            they cannot control its movement. It
            is moved by Fate. And, sooner or
            later, Fate will place it near us.

                        COLWYN
            Then we must be ready. Five leagues
            from here is the Eastern Tower. I
            know the Barons who hold it. Good
            men, and brave. They will help us.

                        YNYR
            You have not slept in two days.

                        COLWYN
            Nor will I, till my bride is beside
            me.

They set off through the forest.

<u>RESUME</u> - LYSSA

                        LYSSA
               (calling)
            Colwyn. Colwyn.

She hears the scrape of a taloned foot behind her and
hurries along the parapet. She stops and looks down at a
small clearing in the jungle, outside the walls.

<u>EXT. JUNGLE CLEARING</u> - INTERCUT - DAY

A fawn grazes in the clearing, unaware of a <u>white leopard</u>
poised on a branch above it. As the leopard is about to
pounce, it glances up and sees Lyssa staring down from the
Fortress wall. As if in answer to her summons, it jumps to
the ground and heads for the wall.

The leopard leaps onto the walkway in front of Lyssa, then
moves obediently to her side. They set off down the walkway
together.

Suddenly the leopard whirls and <u>roars</u> as it hears the scrape
of a taloned foot behind. But other Dark Ones are in front
of them. Lyssa is forced to descend a stone staircase. The
leopard, acting as rear guard, roars its defiance as it
backs down the stairs.

<u>EXT. FOREST BROOK</u> - DAY

Colwyn and Ynyr are about to cross the tiny stream, when
suddenly a <u>small white cloud</u> materializes above the water,
bulging and gyrating, affording brief glimpses of feet and
hands, as if a small man were trying to escape. As Colwyn
jumps back, drawing his sword, the cloud vanishes with a <u>POP</u>
and the small man, ERGO, is plopped on his seat in the water
(which is only a few inches deep).

                        ERGO
            Help! Help! I'm drowning!

                        COLWYN
            I doubt it. The water is only an
            inch deep.

                        ERGO
               (stands)
            It could have been quicksand! I
            might have been sucked to my death.
               (jumps out of the water)
            Where is this place?

                        COLWYN
            A forest near the Valley of Needles.

                        ERGO
            Blast! A thousand miles off course.
            Well, I was rushed. There was a
            certain difference of opinion
            concerning a venison pie. The
            foolish man left it sitting on his
            windowsill. What did he expect?

                        COLWYN
            Perhaps he expected to eat it.

                        ERGO
            For that rudeness, peasant lout, I
            am going to leave you hanging by
            your heels when I depart. Which is
            right now.

>From the folds of his voluminous clothing, Ergo produces a
tattered spellbook. He peers at a page, mumbles to himself,
and pokes his head toward Colwyn - whereupon he vanishes.
Colwyn glances around but the little man is nowhere to be
seen.

                        ERGO (O.S.)
            Get me down from here!

Colwyn turns and sees Ergo hanging upside-down from a tree
limb directly behind him. He lifts him down.

                        ERGO
            My spells always go wrong when I am
            observed. Be gone!

                        YNYR
            The forest is not safe these days.
            You'd best travel with us.

                        ERGO
            <u>Me</u>? Travel with <u>you</u>? I am Ergo the
            Magnificent ...
               (flattens hand)
            ... short in stature ...
               (points to the sky)
            ... tall in power ...
               (opposes thumb and forefinger)
            ... narrow of purpose ...
               (shades eyes)
            ... wide of vision. And I do not
            travel with peasants and beggars.
            Goodbye!

We follow Ergo as he sets off down the forest path, heading
in the opposite direction from Colwyn and Ynyr. After a few
yards, the forest seems to grow darker, the sounds more
ominous. Ergo glances around apprehensively. Suddenly,
through an opening in the leaves, he sees a face with a
<u>single eye</u> in the middle of it.

With a yelp, he turns and races back up the path after
Colwyn and Ynyr. When he catches up, he wedges himself
between them to get as much protection as possible.

                        ERGO
            I just remembered I have urgent
            business in this direction.

                        COLWYN
            What business?

                        ERGO
               (fearful glance behind)
            Staying alive.

<u>EXT. FOREST CLEARING</u> - DAY

As Colwyn, Ynyr, and Ergo cross the clearing, Ergo steps on
a snare-trigger and is suddenly hoisted into the air by his
foot. Colwyn draws his sword and turns to face five armed
men who step out of the forest. They're a rag-tag bunch,
garbed in various kinds of chain-mail and armed with a
bizarre variety of weapons.

                        TORQUIL (O.S.)
            The lad is quick, very quick.

Colwyn wheels to see TORQUIL THE ROBBER leaning against a
tree, his huge battle-axe resting casually across his
shoulders. His cheek bulges with a wad of chewing tobacco.

                        TORQUIL
            But also very young. Six to one is
            no odds, boy.

                        ERGO
               (yelling as he hangs upside-
                down)
            Get me down from here you louts or
            I'll turn you all into pigs!

Torquil glances up at Ergo, then spits a stream of brown
juice at the ground and steps forward to investigate his
prisoners.

                        ERGO
               (muttering as he fumbles for
                his spellbook)
            They'll soon learn the price of
            snaring Ergo the Magnificent.

Torquil walks a circle around Colwyn and Ynyr.

                        TORQUIL
            When your enemies outnumber you,
            boy, craft is more profitable than
            courage. Smile and go along and,
            sooner or later, they will grow
            careless. And then ...
               (throat-cutting gesture)
            ... sst!

Colwyn sheaths his sword.

                        COLWYN
               (little smile)
            I don't think you'll grow careless.

                        TORQUIL
               (grins)
            Smart as well as quick. Now what do
            you have to give us?

                        COLWYN
            Fame.

                        TORQUIL
            Fame?
               (laughs)
            Thank you, no. Fame is the burial
            ground of contentment. Eat it and go
            hungry; count it and go broke; seek
            it and grow mad. Fame is what fools
            yearn for and wise men shun.

                        COLWYN
            Fame is what you leave to your sons.

                        TORQUIL
               (taken aback)
            How did you know I had sons?

                        COLWYN
            Because you would not rob if you had
            no children to provide for.

                        TORQUIL
            Hah! You don't know me, boy.

                        COLWYN
               (fixes him with a look)
            I know you.

                        YNYR
               (to Colwyn)
            You choose these?

                        COLWYN
            Yes. They will be more help than
            high-born barons.

                        TORQUIL
            They stand at the edge of the grave
            and make jokes.
               (shouts)
            Do you know who I am, sprout? I am
            Torquil, Lord of the forest. My men
            follow no man but me, and I follow
            no man at all.

                        COLWYN
            You will follow me.

                        TORQUIL
               (shifts his axe)
            And in the few seconds before I dice
            you to crow-food, tell me why I am
            going to follow you.

                        COLWYN
            So your sons will speak of you to
            your grandsons, and your grandsons
            to their grandsons.

Torquil plunks the handle of his long battle-axe into the
ground, then folds his hands across the top of the blade and
rests his chin on his hands. He stares hard at Colwyn, who
returns his gaze calmly.

                        TORQUIL
            And where do you lead, boy?

                        COLWYN
            To the place where Death lives.

                        TORQUIL
               (grins)
            It should be an interesting journey,
            then.

                        COLWYN
               (answering smile)
            That I promise you.

                        TORQUIL
               (to his men)
            I compel no man to follow me on this
            journey.

                        KEGAN
            We owe you our lives, Torquil. If
            you follow the boy, so also do we.

BARDOLPH, OSWIN, and RUHN nod their agreement. The sixth
robber, SWEYN, back away.

                        SWEYN
            I follow the man who follows gold.
            He who follows glory travels without
            me.

                        TORQUIL
            Go then, and let greed be your
            gravestone.

Sweyn moves off into the forest. An angry <u>oink</u> causes the
others to look up at the snare, which holds a small pig by
its foot; as usual, Ergo's magic has boomeranged.

                        TORQUIL
            What have we here?
               (prods the pig with his axe)
            Roast pork for dinner.

The pig <u>squeals</u> his objections. Torquil signals to drop the
snare, and picks the pig up under his arm.

                        COLWYN
            He needs his book.

Torquil finds the open spellbook and kneels, allowing the
pig to read it. <u>Pop</u>, and Torquil is holding a gyrating cloud
under his arm, replete with squeals and yells and pieces of
pig and Ergo; <u>pop</u>, and the cloud disappears, leaving Ergo
under Torquil's arm.

                        ERGO
            Put me down, you lout!

                        TORQUIL
               (sets him down)
            You had better manners as a pig.

                        ERGO
               (haughty)
            I am Ergo the Magnificent, and I do
            not travel with thieves and robbers.

He takes two steps into the forest, then glances around
anxiously.

                        ERGO
               (backing out of the forest)
            Except when necessary.

<u>EXT. HILL OVERLOOKING VALLEY</u> - SUNSET

As the band nears the crest of the hill, Colwyn stumbles.
Torquil reaches out to steady him.

                        TORQUIL
            When did you last sleep, boy?

                        COLWYN
               (shaking off the help)
            I'm all right.

They top the hill and look out over the valley, dotted with
plumes of smoke from burning villages.

                        TORQUIL
            They burn many villages. Even walled
            cities fall to them.

                        COLWYN
               (angrily)
            Why do they burn the villages?
            There's nothing to gain.

                        YNYR
            There's terror to gain. Their wealth
            is fear: they get it with fire, they
            spend it to rule.

<u>EXT. FOREST CLEARING</u> - NIGHT

The band has stopped in the middle of the clearing. Colwyn
is swaying, barely able to stand.

                        TORQUIL
            We'll stop here to hunt. Even those
            who don't sleep must eat.

Colwyn folds his arms across his chest, tries to stand up
straight.

                        COLWYN
               (eyes drifting shut)
            I'm not hungry.

                        TORQUIL
               (folding his arms across his
                chest)
            Not sleepy, either?

                        COLWYN
               (eyes almost closed, swaying)
            No.

Torquil purses his lips and <u>blows</u> at Colwyn, who falls
backward into the arms of Kegan, who lays him gently on the
ground, fast asleep. Torquil covers him with his cape. The
other robbers string their bows and prepare to hunt.

                        ERGO
            Bring me a deer! No deer, no supper.

<u>EXT. FOREST CLEARING</u> - AN HOUR LATER

Torquil and Ynyr talk to several PEASANTS at the edge of the
clearing while, in the center, Ergo tends the cooking fire,
beside which Colwyn lies asleep. Ergo's face lights up when
he sees Kegan arrive with a stag across his shoulders, and
he snick-snacks his carving knife in anticipation. But
Torquil has Kegan turn over the stag to the peasants, which
nearly gives Ergo apoplexy.

                        ERGO
               (galloping across the
                clearing)
            What are you doing with my dear?
            Stop! Thieves!

                        TORQUIL
               (restraining him)
            Many villagers are hiding in the
            forest. They need food.

                        ERGO
            And do you think I live on air?

                        TORQUIL
            We have plenty of hares.

                        ERGO
               (snorts)
            Food for crows.

                        TORQUIL
            Surely a sorcerer of the sauce pan
            can make rabbit taste like venison.

                        ERGO
            I am being exploited! Where are you
            going?

                        TORQUIL
               (moving off with Ynyr)
            I must take the old man to see some
            sick children. Kegan will guard
            you.

But Kegan spots a hare and creeps into the forest after it,
leaving Ergo and Colwyn alone in the clearing.

Suddenly, Ergo hears ominous noises. He peers into the dark
forest and his jaw drops as he sees a pair of <u>red eyes</u>
staring out of the gloom. He snatches up a carving knife and
a frying pan and backs toward Colwyn, holding the pan as a
shield. The red-eyed thing moves toward them through the
trees, and poor Ergo is unmanned by fear: he drops his knife
and ducks his head behind the frying pan in sheer terror.

But he hears the thing stop short and raises his head to
look behind him, where a CYCLOPS stands with trident poised
to throw. The little man assumes that both creatures are
trying to kill him and faints dead away. But the trident is
aimed at the red-eyed thing, which has no desire to do
battle with the Cyclops. The thing retreats, the red eyes
fade. The Cyclops comes over to Ergo and kneels to listen to
his heart. Then he enters the forest after the Dark One.

<u>EXT. FOREST CLEARING</u> - LATER THAT NIGHT

The band, including Colwyn, is gathered around Ergo, who is
telling his story.

                        ERGO
               (indicating positions)
            One with red eyes, the other with
            one eye, both trying to kill me.

                        YNYR
            The one with red eyes was a Dark
            One, the other was a Cyclops, and it
            was not you he meant to kill.

                        ERGO
            He was aiming a huge spear right at
            me!

                        YNYR
            If that were so, you'd be dead now.
            He was aiming at the Dark One, for
            there is ancient hatred between
            them. Once his race had two eyes,
            like other men, until his
            forefathers bargained with the Dark
            Ones: they gave up one of their eyes
            in return for the power to see the
            future. But they were cheated, for
            the only future they were permitted
            to see was the time of their own
            death.

                        COLWYN
            They know when they're going to die?

                        YNYR
               (nods)
            Everyone of his race is born knowing
            the day of his death.

                        TORQUIL
            Knowledge I wouldn't want.

                        YNYR
            No. They are sad, solitary
            creatures, rarely seen.

                        ERGO
            Once is enough, thank you.

                        COLWYN
            He saved our lives.

                        TORQUIL
               (glance toward fire)
            But not our supper.

Ergo sees smoke rising from a pot on the fire.

                        ERGO
               (running to the pot)
            Oh, my poor stew!

                        TORQUIL
            Oh, my poor stomach.

<u>EXT. FOREST CLEARING</u> - NEAR DAWN

The band is asleep, Torquil on guard. As the eastern horizon
grows light, Torquil wakes Ynyr and Colwyn.

<u>EXT. FOREST, A FEW YARDS FROM CLEARING</u> - DAWN

Colwyn sits against a tree, brow furrowed in concentration,
the golden glaive spinning in midair in front of him. Ynyr
and Torquil look on.

                        COLWYN
            I can't reach her.

                        YNYR
            What do you see?

                        COLWYN
            Darkness. Tunnels and corridors.
               (pause)
            Wait.

<u>INT. CORRIDOR IN KRULL</u> - INTERCUT

Lyssa moves down the windowless corridor with the white
leopard at her side.

                        COLWYN (OVER)
               (faintly)
            Lyssa ...

                        LYSSA (OVER)
            Colwyn ...

                        COLWYN (OVER)
            Where is the Fortress?

                        LYSSA (OVER)
            I don't know. It's a maze of
            tunnels. I can't see out.

                        COLWYN (OVER)
            I will find you. I will be with you.

                        LYSSA (OVER)
            I know it.

                        COLWYN (OVER)
               (fading)
            I love you, Lyssa, I love you ...

                        LYSSA (OVER)
            Colwyn. Colwyn.
               (in her own voice)
            I love you, Colwyn.

<u>RESUME</u> - COLWYN ET. AL.

                        COLWYN
            She can't see out. She can't tell us
            where the Fortress is.

                        YNYR
            Yes, they knew of your first
            contact, so they drove her below.

                        COLWYN
            She was very faint. I was barely
            able to reach her.

                        YNYR
            The deeper she goes, the harder it
            is to contact her. Once she is below
            the second level, you will not be
            able to reach her at all.

                        COLWYN
               (leaps to his feet, shouts
                angrily)
            I will find her!

He hurls his glaive at a nearby tree: the weapon bores clean
through the trunk, then through two more before it imbeds
itself in a fourth. But anger gives way to despair; he
buries his face in his hands.

                        YNYR
               (hand on his shoulder)
            We'll seek an Emerald Seer. They
            have great powers of vision.

                        TORQUIL
            There's an Emerald Circle a few
            leagues from here.
               (moves to Colwyn)
            We'll find her.

                        COLWYN
               (looks up)
            Forgive me. It's childish to cry.

                        TORQUIL
               (thumbs the tears from
                Colwyn's cheeks)
            Those are not child's tear. A child
            cries for himself, a man cries for
            those he loves.

<u>RESUME</u> - LYSSA

She and the leopard are forced deeper in the Fortress, down
yet another flight of stairs.

<u>EXT. HILL OVERLOOKING STONE LAKE</u> - DAY

Colwyn and Torquil top the hill and look down at the lake,
the surface of which looks as if it had been instantly
frozen in the midst of a great storm.

                        TORQUIL
            We can save half a day by crossing
            the Stone Lake.

                        YNYR
               (coming up)
            Many have perished in that maze.

                        TORQUIL
               (grin)
            No maze to me, my fried. It is where
            we take refuge when they hunt us.

                        COLWYN
            Lead us across.

<u>EXT. STONE LAKE</u> - DAY

At the edge of the lake, an enormous wave is poised to
break, frozen in blue stone, even to the froth that caps it.
Torquil leads the band into the maze.

                        ERGO
               (walking beside Ynyr)
            I wish you'd tell me why that
            foolish boy decided to join up with
            these thieves.

The little man suddenly lets out a yelp and jumps back: He
is staring into the jaws of a huge shark frozen in the wave
(as was all the marine life in the lake, including gulls
with one foot touching the water). He steers around the jaws
and catches up to Ynyr.

                        YNYR
            He didn't join them. They joined
            him.

                        ERGO
            And who is <u>he</u> that they should join
            <u>him</u>?

                        YNYR
            He is the King.

                        ERGO
            Well, at least I'm glad to see you
            have a sense of humor. That's the
            first smile I've seen on that gloomy
            face of your's ...
               (Ynyr is not smiling)
            ... isn't it? It isn't. Oh no. Oh
            dear. Oh now I've gone and done it.

He scurries forward and tugs at Colwyn's jacket.

                        ERGO
            Your kingship ... your lord high
            mightiness ... when I called you a
            ... a ... whatever I called you, I
            didn't realize that you were ...
            were ...

                        COLWYN
            I was hoping I might be your friend.

                        ERGO
               (staggered)
            My <u>friend</u>.

                        COLWYN
            I have need of friends.

                        ERGO
               (flattered nearly senseless)
            No more, my lord - my friend. With
            Ergo the Magnificent by your side,
            your enemies are dead men.

The little man pulls out a carving knife and, with a
flourish, tucks it in his belt - slicing through his outer
garment as he does so. Colwyn glances down and sees red
liquid oozing from the cut. Ergo follows his gaze.

                        ERGO
               (staggering)
            Argh! I'm dying!

Colwyn notices <u>seeds</u> oozing out with the liquid and samples
it with his finger.

                        COLWYN
            Not yet, my friend. It's your tomato
            that's dying.

                        ERGO
            <u>What</u>? Oh no! Better it was me. There
            isn't another good tomato within a
            hundred leagues.

He pulls out the stabbed tomato and kisses it tearfully.

                        ERGO
            Oh, my poor baby.

He looks up to see Ynyr smiling broadly.

                        ERGO
               (scowling)
            I liked you better gloomy, old man.

Colwyn resumes his place beside Torquil, who gives him a
sideways glance.

                        TORQUIL
            So. You're something more than a
            seeker of fame.

Colwyn shrugs sheepishly.

                        TORQUIL
            Well, I'm not impressed.

                        COLWYN
               (smiles)
            I knew you would not be. That's why
            I chose you.

They reach the end of the lake, which is bordered by a small
scarp. Torquil hikes himself onto the scarp and reaches down
to help Colwyn up.

                        TORQUIL
               (grin)
            I'm a <u>little</u> impressed.

<u>EXT. EMERALD STONEHENGE</u> - LATE AFTERNOON

A circle of stone dolmens, emerald green, in the center of
which sits an old man, blind, wearing a green robe: an
EMERALD SEER. Sitting across from him is TITCH, his ten-
year-old assistant, similarly robed.

A green-hued holographic image appears above the emerald,
showing Colwyn and his band approaching. The Seer weaves his
fingers through the image, reading it by touch.

                        SEER
            Eight come here, Brother. They have
            traveled far. Fetch bread and wine.

                        TITCH
            Yes, Brother.

The boy fetches a jug of wine and a round loaf of bread, and
approaches Colwyn's band as they enter the stone circle.
Colwyn waves Titch toward his men and moves with Ynyr and
Torquil to the Seer.

                        YNYR
            We seek the Fortress of Krull.

                        SEER
            Such a vision will be opposed. Who
            seeks it?

                        YNYR
            The new King.

                        SEER
               (little smile)
            With an old voice?

                        YNYR
               (answering smile)
            You know the voice.

                        SEER
            Yes. You have left your place in the
            Needle. It is the time, then.

                        YNYR
            It is the time.

                        SEER
            I will seek the Fortress for you.

The Seer presses his fingertips against the rotating sphere,
increasing the pressure and friction until small tongues of
flame spurt from beneath his fingertips.

A holograph begins to form above the sphere: the Fortress in
mid-ocean.

                        SEER
            Can you see?

                        YNYR
            Yes. It is the Western Ocean.

                        COLWYN
            There is a prisoner there.

                        SEER
            Yes.

The holograph dissolves, replaced by a new one which shows a
curving Arm of the Vortex, the deep, central parts of the
Fortress. Lyssa and the white leopard move down the Arm,
pressed by an unseen pursuer.

                        COLWYN
               (leaning forward)
            Lyssa.

As the twin suns dip below the horizon, the flames spurting
from the Seer's fingertips begin to leap and lengthen, until
the sphere is surrounded by fire, its color changing from
emerald-green to crimson. We hear faint, hollow <u>screams of</u>
<u>rage</u>.

The holograph above the sphere begins to waver and blur,
then is shattered by a holographic black claw shooting
upward from the sphere. The talons of the claw are blood
red, its appearance accompanied by a hollow <u>scream</u>.

The Seer is knocked backward; the claw disappears; the
emerald drops to the ground.

                        COLWYN
               (kneeling by the Seer)
            Are you hurt?

                        SEER
               (sitting up)
            No.
               (grim smile)
            The Dark Ones do not like curious
            Seers poking into their affairs.

                        COLWYN
            Can you tell us where the Fortress
            will rise tomorrow?

                        SEER
            I cannot see the future, only the
            present. But at dawn tomorrow, I can
            see where the fortress has risen
            that day - and every day thereafter,
            until Fate brings it near us.

                        YNYR
            The Dark Ones will appose you with
            all their power.

                        SEER
            They will fail for, during the day,
            the power of the Circle is greater
            than theirs. Only at night can they
            pierce the Circle.

Titch approaches Ergo with bread and wine.

                        ERGO
               (wrinkling his nose)
            Bread is for peasants, and wine
            makes me sneeze. Got any gumdrops?

                        TITCH
            No.

                        ERGO
            Sugarballs?

                        TITCH
            No.

                        ERGO
               (annoyed)
            What kind of a boy are you? Boys
            always have candy.

                        TITCH
            I have a cinnamon bar.

                        ERGO
            You do?

                        TITCH
               (producing the bar)
            You can have half.

Ergo takes the bar and breaks it into unequal parts. He is
about to take the bigger piece for himself when conscience
gets the better of him; reluctantly, he offers the bigger
piece to Titch. But the boy takes the small piece, leaving
the delighted Ergo with the lion's share.

                        ERGO
               (mouth full)
            I am Ergo the Magnificent ...
               (flattens hand)
            ... short in stature ...
               (points to sky)
            ... tall in power ...
               (opposes thumb and forefinger)
            ... narrow of purpose ...
               (shades eyes)
            ... wide of vision.

                        TITCH
               (mouth full, points to his
                chest)
            I ...
               (bows from waist)
            ... am Titch.

<u>EXT. EMERALD STONEHENGE</u> - NIGHT

While Ergo and Titch tend the cooking fire, robbers leave to
hunt and others return with small game.

Sitting against one of the stone dolmens, Colwyn tries to
contact Lyssa, the glaive spinning in midair in front of
him. Ynyr and Torquil look on.

                        COLWYN
            I cannot reach her.

                        YNYR
            She is too deep. The curved tunnel
            we saw is part of the Vortex, the
            place of The Beast.

                        TORQUIL
            The leader of the Dark Ones?

                        YNYR
            Yes.
               (to Colwyn)
            Like you, a King. A King of many
            worlds. All enslaved.

                        COLWYN
            The first time, when they attacked
            long ago, was The Beast here?

                        YNYR
            No. Then they were led by his
            underlings. But I knew he had come
            this time, from the ferocity of
            their onslaught, from their use of
            The Fortress. They use up much of
            their strength to do these things.
            They are taking great risks.

                        COLWYN
            <u>Why</u>?

                        YNYR
               (evasive)
            I'm not sure.

                        COLWYN
            But you suspect.

                        YNYR
            You will know, in good time.

At the cooking fire, Kegan arrives with a string of small
game.

                        ERGO
               (disgusted)
            Rabbits and squirrels. Where is my
            deer!

                        KEEGAN
            We saw nothing but does and fawns,
            and we shoot only stags.

Kegan lays down the string of game and moves off.

                        ERGO
               (grumbling)
            Nothing worse than lower-class boors
            with upper-class morals.

                        CYCLOPS (O.S.)
            Would you settle for a boar?

                        ERGO
               (to Titch)
            A <u>boar</u>? Those incompetent louts
            couldn't catch a piglet, much less a
            boar.

He realizes that the voice has come from behind him and
turns to see the Cyclops with a huge boar slung across his
shoulders.

                        ERGO
            You!

                        CYCLOPS
            Me.
               (lays down the boar)
            May I eat with you tonight?

                        ERGO
            Tonight and every night, my friend,
            for this is the second time you've
            saved my life.
               (draws himself up)
            I am Ergo the Magnificent, short in
            stature, tall in power, etcetera,
            etcetera.

                        CYCLOPS
            I am Quell.

                        TITCH
            I'm hungry.

                        ERGO
            Smart lad.
               (theatrical)
            Bring me my spices!

Titch hands him a leather belt of spices.

                        TITCH
            I must fetch my master.
               (smiles at Cyclops as he
                passes)
            I'm Titch.

<u>EXT. STREAM NEAR STONEHENGE</u> - NIGHT

The Seer kneels at water's edge, washing his hands with
ritual motions. He hears footsteps behind him.

                        SEER
            Is that you, Brother?

We see a CHANGELING/SEER standing behind him: an exact twin,
except that his eyes are open and <u>red</u>. Changeling reaches
down and places his hand on the Seer's neck.

                        CHANGELING
               (hiss)
            It is me, Brother.

His hand turns into a <u>taloned claw</u>, which tightens around
the Seer's neck, throttling him. He lowers the body into the
stream, then reaches into the Seer's robe and extracts the
emerald, which he <u>crushes</u> in his claw. The green fragments
drop into the water, floating downstream behind the Seer's
body.

His bloody claw now reverts to human form, but the fingers
remain bloody. He kneels and washes off the blood. When he
hears Titch approaching, he closes his eyes.

                        CHANGELING
               (in Seer's voice)
            Is that you, Brother?

                        TITCH
            It is me, Brother.

He stands and places his hand on the boy's shoulder to be
led back to camp. The Cyclops appears, having followed Titch
to guard him.

The Cyclops glances at the Changeling, but notices nothing
unusual. He takes a few steps farther down the path, to
check it out - and stops just short of a point that would
show him the Seer's body fetched up against a rock in the
stream. He turns and follows Titch back to the campsite.

<u>EXT. STONEHENGE</u> - NIGHT

The band is seated around the fire, finishing a huge dinner
of roast boar. The Changeling/Seer sits slightly apart, his
eye-lids lifting occasionally to afford a thin slit, through
which he surveys the group with <u>red eyes</u>.

                        TORQUIL
               (raising a joint)
            Passable, pimple, very passable.

                        ERGO
            The greatest boon of your otherwise
            worthless life, blockhead, is the
            privilege of dining on boar roasted
            by the hand of Ergo the Magnificent.

                        TORQUIL
            Your boast is a bigger mouthful than
            your roast, Magnificence.

He glances over his shoulder at Colwyn, who is leaning
against a dolmen, staring gloomily into the darkness.
Torquil gets up and goes to him, carrying the joint.

                        TORQUIL
            You've eaten nothing.

                        COLWYN
               (shrug, pause)
            We must try to get horses.

                        TORQUIL
            Yes. It will double our range.
               (grins)
            I know at least a dozen ways to get
            horses. All cheap.

                        COLWYN
               (little smile)
            These we'll pay for.

                        TORQUIL
               (sigh)
            Lad, you have an unnatural desire to
            pay for things. It stunts the mind
            and shrivels the imagination.

                        COLWYN
               (thumb in his ribs)
            Hand over your dinner.

                        TORQUIL
               (hands it over)
            A flicker of talent.

Colwyn's hunger comes alive as he starts to work on the
joint.

                        TORQUIL
            But I can't tell yet whether it's a
            talent for theft or gluttony.

Ergo, Titch, and the Cyclops, full to bursting, are
stretched out together beside the fire.

                        ERGO
            If I could wish ...
               (belch)
            ... for anything, I'd wish for a
            venison pie the size of a ...
               (belch)
            ... mountain. No, that's too greedy.
            I'd settle for one the size of a
            house.

                        TITCH
            I'd wish for a puppy.

                        ERGO
            One puppy? Why not wish for a
            hundred?

                        TITCH
            I only want one.

                        ERGO
            A foolish wish. And you, Quell?

                        CYCLOPS
               (after a pause)
            Ignorance.

<u>EXT. STONEHENGE</u> - NIGHT

Bardolph and Oswin stand guard over the sleeping band,
stationed at the perimeter of the Circle, looking outward.
The Cyclops broods by the fire, his expression troubled. He
frowns and looks around, then gets up and moves out of the
Circle into the darkness.

As soon as the Cyclops is gone, the Changeling/Seer opens
his eyes and looks around. He stands and moves toward
Bardolph.

                        BARDOLPH
               (turns)
            Who's there?

                        CHANGELING
               (holding out a hand)
            It's me, Brother. I am thirsty.

                        BARDOLPH
            Here, I'll guide you.

He approaches the Changeling, who places a hand on his
shoulder to be led to the stream.

<u>EXT. PATH TO STREAM NEAR STONEHENGE</u> - NIGHT

As they move down the path, the Changeling's hand turns into
a <u>claw</u> and he throttles Bardolph so quickly he's unable to
utter a sound. He tosses the body into the bushes and starts
to wipe his bloody hand on the grass - but stands as he
hears Colwyn coming down the path.

                        COLWYN
            Where is Bardolph, Brother?

                        CHANGELING
            He heard something and went to
            investigate, Brother.

Colwyn starts to move past him to the stream.

                        CHANGELING
               (reaching out)
            Lead me to the stream, Brother.

Colwyn stops and allows the Changeling to place a hand on
his shoulder. A close shot of the Changeling's hand shows it
still bloody, the blood running onto the cloth of Colwyn's
jacket.

<u>EXT. STREAM NEAR STONEHENGE</u> - INTERCUT - NIGHT

The Cyclops stands near the spot where the real Seer was
killed. He moves downstream a few yards - and suddenly sees
the Seer's body floating in the water, caught against the
rocks. He realizes immediately that the band is in great
danger; he races up the path toward the camp.

As Colwn leads the Changeling down the path, we see the hand
on his shoulder turn into a <u>claw</u>. The claw is moving toward
his neck when suddenly the Cyclops bursts from the trees in
front of them. Colwyn stares in disbelief as the Cyclops
hurls his trident straight at him. The weapon whistles past
his ear and slices off the Changeling's arm at the shoulder.

Colwyn spins, sees the red eyes, ducks backward as the
Changeling swipes at him with his other hand - now become a
claw. He draws his glaive as the Changeling reverts entirely
to bestial form, its hideous black body bursting the seams
of the emerald-green robe.

As the creature springs at Colwyn, we see, for an instant,
the horrible face: teeth flashing, eyes burning. Then
Colwyn's glaive strikes between the eyes. Slit by the
horizontal blades of the glaive, the eyes explode in a burst
of red and the thing dies with a scream.

Torquil, Ynyr, and others run up. The body of the creature
has already turned to ash, forming the characteristic Vortex
of the Dark Ones.

                        CYCLOPS
               (to Ynyr)
            A Changeling.

                        YNYR
            Yes. It chose the Seer's form so it
            wouldn't have to show its eyes.

                        COLWYN
               (to Cyclops)
            How did you know?

                        CYCLOPS
            I found the body of the Seer in the
            stream.

They all look up the path at Titch, who is rubbing his eyes
sleepily. Ergo goes up to him and puts an arm around his
shoulders.

<u>EXT. STONEHENGE</u> - NIGHT

The band stands beside a fresh grave, outlined by stone
markers. Colwyn is kneeling with his arms around Titch,
whose face is buried against his chest.

                        COLWYN
            If he had not agreed to help us,
            they would not have killed him. He
            gave his life for us.

                        TITCH
            He was my only family.

                        COLWYN
            We're your family now.

<u>EXT. STONEHENGE</u> - LATER THAT NIGHT

Colwyn, Ynyr, and Torquil sit by the fire while the others
sleep.

                        YNYR
            I must go to the widow. Perhaps she
            will help.

                        TORQUIL
            The Widow of the Web?

                        YNYR
            Yes.

                        TORQUIL
            That creature helps no one. And none
            who go there return.

                        YNYR
            She has the power of vision.

                        TORQUIL
            She has the power to kill.

                        YNYR
            Perhaps she will not kill me, for I
            know her name.

                        TORQUIL
            Her name is Death.

                        YNYR
            She had another name once.

                        COLWYN
               (with finality)
            No. We will find another way to
            locate the Fortress.

                        YNYR
            There is no other way. You asked me
            why the Beast had come this time.

                        COLWYN
            Yes.

                        YNYR
            He has come for Lyssa.

                        COLWYN
            Lyssa? <u>Why</u>?

                        YNYR
            Like you, she has extraordinary
            powers. He would make her his Queen.

                        COLWYN
            Can she be forced?

                        YNYR
            No. She must agree of her own free
            will.

                        COLWYN
            Never.

                        YNYR
            You are young. You don't understand
            the attraction of great power, and
            you forget the pain of long waiting.

                        COLWYN
            Then we must reach her before she
            feels that pain.

                        YNYR
            Yes.

On the other side of the fire, Ergo lies awake, watching
Titch, who is asleep next to him, his face tear-stained. The
Cyclops sits nearby, leaning against a stone, one hand on
his trident. His eye is closed; he appears to be asleep.

Ergo sits up, takes his spellbook, and sneaks off behind a
stone. The Cyclops opens his eye and watches as Ergo thumbs
through the book, mumbles a spell, and disappears in a
gyrating white cloud. When the cloud disappears, <u>Ergo has</u>
<u>transformed himself into a puppy</u>. The puppy trots over to
the sleeping Titch and licks his face. The boy stirs, opens
his eyes, and hugs the puppy to his chest.

<u>INT. ARM OF VORTEX</u> - NIGHT

Red eyes press Lyssa and the leopard down the curving
passage-way until they emerge in the center of the vortex.

<u>INT. CENTER OF VORTEX</u> - NIGHT

The Arms open into the top of a huge bloodstone funnel, at
the bottom of which is the hole of the Beast. Lyssa and her
guardian are forced along a spiral walkway that curves down
the walls of the funnel to the dark hole at the bottom.

We hear a heavy, slithering sound, as of an enormous tail
being dragged across stone. A pair of huge red eyes appear
in the Beast's hole and we hear a husky whisper: the sound
is ominous, but also attractive, in the way that enormous
power is always attractive.

                        VOICE OF THE BEAST
            Do not be afraid. You are safe here.
            You are protected by my power.

Lyssa shrinks against the stone. The white leopard <u>roars</u>.

                        VOICE OF THE BEAST
            I am not one of those trivial ones
            who have been guarding you. They are
            my slaves. They are to me as drops
            to an ocean. <u>I rule here</u>.

The leopard leaps at the hole, but is frozen in mid-leap,
suspended in the air.

                        VOICE OF THE BEAST
            I rule <u>all</u> here.

The leopard is suddenly flung backward, hurled with
tremendous force against the stone. Lyssa turns to see it
embedded in the solid rock, mouth open and eyes glazed.

                        VOICE OF THE BEAST
            Nature is my slave here.

A stone claw rises from the floor.

                        VOICE OF THE BEAST
            Its laws are mine to break.

The claw bursts into flame and strikes at Lyssa with such
force that the rock around her is shattered, yet she is
unharmed. The flaming claw lifts her up and sets her down,
then shrinks to a ball of flame and drops into her hand; she
looks down to see that she is holding a rose.

                        VOICE OF THE BEAST
            Such is my power. It can be yours.

When she looks up, the red eyes are gone. She is alone.

<u>EXT. STONEHENGE</u> - EARLY MORNING

Before the camp wakes, the puppy crawls out of Titch's arms
and trots behind the stone. It scans the spellbook lying
open on the ground, then disappears in a gyrating white
cloud and becomes Ergo again. As he sneaks back to his own
blanket, he sees the Cyclops watching him with a smile.

                        ERGO
               (grumbling)
            I still say it was a foolish wish.

<u>EXT. ROAD NEAR SWAMP OF BETRAYAL</u> - DAY

The band makes its way past the Swamp, heading for the
Widow's Mountain, visible in the distance.

                        ERGO
               (glance toward Swamp)
            What is that awful looking place?

                        CYCLOPS
            The Swamp of Betrayal. Be glad we
            don't have to cross it.

                        ERGO
            I'm glad.
               (glance toward Swamp)
            I'm very glad.

<u>EXT. FARTHER DOWN THE ROAD</u> - INTERCUT - DAY

Concealed at the side of the road are ten Slayers and Sweyn,
the robber who refused to go along with the band. He points
down the road at the approaching band. The Chief Slayer
nods, and hands him a leather purse full of gold coins,
which Sweyn tucks in his jacket. They mount their horses and
start down the road.

                        COLWYN
            Slayers!

                        CYCLOPS
            We must enter the swamp.

                        YNYR
            Few have survived it.

                        TORQUIL
               (indicating Slayers)
            Fewer will survive them.

                        COLWYN
            Yes, it's our only chance. They
            can't use their horses there.
            Quickly.

<u>EXT. SWAMP OF BETRAYAL</u> - DAY

A mangrove swamp, with a lattice-work of gnarled roots
hovering above dark waters. The band enters the swamp.

                        CYCLOPS
            Do not let the waters touch you.

                        COLWYN
            What will happen?

                        YNYR
            You will be devoured by your own
            mind.

Colwyn and Torquil help the old man, Ynyr, while the Cyclops
takes care of the two little ones, Ergo and Titch, sometimes
lifting one in each hand to deposit them on the next root.

The Slayers reach the edge of the Swamp and dismount. Sweyn
and the Chief Slayer lead them in.

The band is halfway across the Swamp when Colwyn suddenly
slips and plunges into the water.

                        TORQUIL
               (extends a hand)
            Take hold!

But the waters of betrayal have begun their work:

<u>COLWYN'S POV</u>

He sees Torquil stand and embrace Lyssa, who comes from
behind a tree.

                        TORQUIL
            Let him drown.

                        LYSSA
            Yes. Then we'll marry and you will
            be my king.

They kiss.

<u>BACK TO SHOT</u>

Colwyn draws his sword and swings at Torquil.

                        COLWYN
            Traitor! She'll marry you in hell!

                        YNYR
               (to Torquil)
            He thinks you betray him with Lyssa.
               (to Colwyn)
            Colwyn! The waters deceive you!

<u>COLWYN'S POV</u>

He sees Ynyr stand and talk to someone behind the tree.

                        YNYR
            I have delivered him into your
            hands. Now pay me the price we
            agreed on.

A black claw appears, pouring gold coins into Ynyr's hand.

<u>BACK TO SHOT</u>

Colwyn lunges at Ynyr.

                        COLWYN
            I will melt that gold and pour it
            down your throat, old man!

                        YNYR
            He sees betrayal everywhere. He will
            attack us so long as he is
            conscious.

They glance anxiously at the Slayers, closing quickly. Titch
reaches into Ergo's voluminous coat and pulls out a soup
ladle, which he throws at Colwyn. The ladle catches Colwyn
in the forehead, knocking him unconscious - but also
knocking him backward in the water, out of reach.

                        ERGO
               (to Torquil)
            Your axe! Lay it out!

Torquil tucks the heel of the axe handle under a root and
grips it with both hands. Ergo tightropes out the handle and
kneels on the axe head, directly above Colwyn.

                        TORQUIL
            I can't hold the weight of both of
            you!

                        ERGO
            Hush!

He squinches his eyes shut and mumbles something to himself.
The gyrating white cloud appears with a pop and, when it
pops off, Ergo has been transformed into a <u>snake</u>, with its
tail wrapped around the axe handle. The snakes plunges into
the water and wraps itself around Colwyn's chest. Torquil
grits his teeth and pulls up on the axe, lifting the snake
and Colwyn out of the water and depositing them on a nexus
of roots.

The white cloud reappears and returns Ergo to human form,
barely conscious, coughing and spitting water.

Meanwhile, the Slayers are almost upon them. The Cyclops has
moved to the rear with Kegan, Oswin, and Rhu. As the Chief
Slayer comes within range, the Cyclops lunges with his
trident, slicing the root on which the Slayer stands and
spilling him into the dark waters. Sweyn kneels to help him
out.

                        CHIEF SLAYER
            Traitor!

He stabs Sweyn in the chest, slicing through the purse of
gold coins. Sweyn tumbles into the water, blood and gold
pouring out of the gash in his jacket. The Chief Slayer
attacks the others, wounding some, knocking several into the
water - and they, in turn, attack their fellows.

The band stares in awed silence as the Slayers massacre each
other. The din of battle fades; the Slayers, dead to a man,
float in the water.

As Colwyn regains consciousness, the others gather round.

                        COLWYN
            Forgive me, my friends. I saw
            terrible things.

                        TORQUIL
            They do not exist, except in the
            waters of the Swamp, where they will
            remain.

<u>EXT. OPPOSITE EDGE OF THE SWAMP</u> - DAY

The band emerges from the Swamp, which laps at the foot of
the Widow's Mountain. Ynyr faces Colwyn and Torquil.

                        YNYR
            From here, I must go alone.

                        COLWYN
            You will tell me her name and we
            will go together.

                        YNYR
               (with peculiar emphasis)
            You must never know her name.
               (pause)
            If more than one approaches, she
            will certainly kill them. Alone I
            may have a chance.

                        TORQUIL
               (hand on Colwyn's shoulder)
            Each to his fate, lad.

                        YNYR
               (nods)
            Each to his fate. Wait for me at the
            inn. If I am not back by dawn, you
            will know my fate, and you must go
            on without me.

He turns and starts up the mountain.

At the rear of the group, the Cyclops heads toward a forest,
carrying Titch on his shoulder.

                        ERGO
            Where are you going?

                        CYCLOPS
            We'll meet you at the inn.

                        ERGO
               (hurt)
            Can't I come, too?

                        CYCLOPS
            No.

The Cyclops moves off with Titch.

<u>EXT. FOREST</u> - DAY

Titch rides on the Cyclop's shoulders, straddling his neck.
He holds a small <u>crossbow</u> at the ready.

                        CYCLOPS
               (whispers and points)
            Over there.

Titch takes aim at a great stag, bracing his arm against the
top of the Cyclops's head.

<u>INT. INN</u> - NIGHT

Kegan, Oswin, and Rhun are downing flagons of sack and
dandling pretty INN-GIRLS on their knees. Torquil eyes them
enviously from the fireplace across the room, but can't
bring himself to leave Colwyn, who takes no comfort from
wine or women.

                        COLWYN
            Go, join them.

                        TORQUIL
            What kind of friend do you think I
            am?

                        COLWYN
            The best. But my unhappiness is not
            made lighter by adding your's to it.

                        TORQUIL
            Well, it is true that if I received
            a royal command I couldn't very well
            disobey it, could I?

                        COLWYN
               (little smile)
            Go. I command you.

                        TORQUIL
               (grins)
            Yes, my lord.

He strides across the room, seizes a pair of Inn-Girls by
the waist and swings them around.

Ergo, sitting near Colwyn, stares despondently into the
fire.

                        ERGO
            Try your tricks on me and I'll turn
            myself back into a snake and bite
            you.

                        COLWYN
            You and I will guard the fire.

                        ERGO
            What else is left for a man without
            friends.

Colwyn glances out a back window and sees the <u>body of a stag</u>
being carried past on someone's shoulders.

<u>EXT. WIDOW'S MOUNTAIN</u> - NIGHT

Ynyr climbs toward the <u>hourglass opening</u> of the Widow's cave
above, lit by an eerie light from within.

<u>INT. WIDOW'S CAVE</u> - NIGHT

A gigantic web of <u>crystal</u> stretches across a vast, domed
cavern, shimmering in the luminescence from below. At the
center of the web is a domed cubicle, made of criss-crossed
ribbons of mirror glass. Light flashes off the mirrors in
such a way that it is impossible to see, through the
openings, who or what is within.

The blinding effect does not occur inside the cubicle, so
that a POV SHOT from inside shows the entire web clearly. It
also shows, reflected from hundreds of facets on the inside
of the structure, the face of the WIDOW, the old woman who
sits at the center: a hideous crone, grotesque and
distorted. She sees Ynyr standing at the edge of the web.

                        WIDOW
               (low)
            Someone comes here.

She picks up an hourglass, containing only a handful of
sand, and turns it to start the sand running out.

                        WIDOW
            This is his time.

Ynyr is shouting at her from the edge of the web.

                        YNYR
               (shouting)
            I am Ynyr. I seek the Widow.

But sound does not pierce the cubicle. From inside it, one
can only see his lips moving.

Ynyr steps onto the web and starts toward the center. When
he's halfway across, he turns to see a giant black widow
spider made of <u>crystal</u>, entirely translucent except for a
red hourglass in the center of its crystal abdomen. As the
spider approaches Ynyr and prepares to attack, the red color
expands, filling the abdomen first, then spreading through
the rest of the body.

Ynyr holds up his glaive. The spider stops, begins moving
sideways; the redness fades. Inside the cubicle, the
hourglass sand has almost run out.

The spider twitches a crystal strand, throwing Ynyr off
balance and causing the glaive to fly from his hand. It
sticks in a crystal strand, too far to reach. Ynyr is
helpless. The spider advances, reddening.

                        YNYR
               (desperate shout)
            Lyssa!

<u>This</u> name has the power to pierce the soundproof cubicle:
the Widow stands as she hears the name, ECHOED by the huge
cavern.

                        WIDOW
               (calls)
            Who speaks that name!

                        YNYR
               (shouts)
            Ynyr!

She watches as the spider looms over Ynyr. Then she reaches
behind her and turns the hourglass, just as the last grains
of sand run out. This causes the spider to back away,
turning translucent again. Ynyr retrieves the glaive and
makes his way to the domed cubicle.

He enters the cubicle to find the Widow facing away from
him, though he can see her hideous face reflected back by
the mirrors in front of her.

                        WIDOW
            It is fifty years since I heard that
            name.

                        YNYR
            It is fifty years since I spoke it
            to you.

                        WIDOW
            I was beautiful then.

                        YNYR
            The most beautiful woman in the
            world.

                        WIDOW
            But you would not stay with me.

                        YNYR
            Could not. Could not betray the girl
            to whom I was betrothed.

                        WIDOW
            She was not as beautiful.

                        YNYR
            No, she was not as beautiful.

                        WIDOW
            She bore you many children?

                        YNYR
            We had no children.

                        WIDOW
            You had a son.

                        YNYR
               (staggered)
            You said nothing. You told me
            nothing.

                        WIDOW
            You had left me! I kept silent out
            of rage.

                        YNYR
            Where is he? My son.

                        WIDOW
            I killed him when he was born.
               (pause)
            This place is my punishment.

The old man bends his head sadly. When he looks up, he sees
in the mirrors that tears are coursing down the Widow's
cheek. As he watches the tears, the mirrored face turns to
that of a beautiful young girl. And the Widow is stunned to
find that she sees the reflections as <u>he</u> sees them: the face
of a young girl.

                        WIDOW
            Do not try your trickery on me!

                        YNYR
            It is no trickery.

                        WIDOW
            Those are reflections.
               (turns to face him)
            <u>This</u> is my face!

When she starts to turn, we SEE her as old. But when she
faces Ynyr, we SEE her THROUGH HIS EYES: as a young girl.

                        YNYR
            You see?

                        WIDOW
               (smiles)
            Yes.

A REVERSE ANGLE explains her smile: she sees him as the
young man who loved her.

                        YNYR
            Memory is no trick, it is a power.
            The power to see.

                        WIDOW
            Power you have given me. What can my
            power give you?

                        YNYR
            Knowledge.

                        WIDOW
            Of what?

                        YNYR
            The Fortress of Krull. When will it
            come near here?

                        WIDOW
            Why must you know?

                        YNYR
            There is a girl there. Her name is
            Lyssa.

                        WIDOW
            You lie!

                        YNYR
               (touches her cheek)
            Could I lie to you and still see
            your beauty?

                        WIDOW
               (lowers her eyes)
            No.

                        YNYR
            A young man seeks her. A young man
            about the age I was when I met you.

                        WIDOW
            Tomorrow, the Fortress of Krull will
            rise with the sun in the Valley of
            Reeds. But the knowledge is of no
            use to you. No man has ever escaped
            the Web. And soon the creature will
            come for you, even here.

Ynyr touches his glaive.

                        WIDOW
               (shakes her head)
            It will not help.

                        YNYR
            Then the other Lyssa will share your
            fate. She will grow old in the
            Fortress as you have grown old here.

The Widow takes a small gold hourglass from a mirrored
niche.

                        WIDOW
            Hold out your hand.

She breaks the hourglass and pours the sand into his open
hand.

                        WIDOW
            Those are the sands of my life. So
            long as they remain in your hand,
            the creature cannot harm you.

Ynyr closes his hand, but the sand trickles out through his
fingers. He tries clenching it tightly, but the sand
continues to run.

                        YNYR
            I cannot stop the sand.

                        WIDOW
            You cannot stop time. Go now, before
            it runs out.

                        YNYR
            You will come with me.

                        WIDOW
            There is sand enough for only one
            life. Go now, save the other.

She watches Ynyr make his way across the web toward the cave
entrance. The ANGLE is BEHIND HER, and we SEE her hands grow
gnarled and mottled, her body become that of an old woman
once again - but when we SWING AROUND IN FRONT OF HER, we
SEE that <u>her face is still that of a young girl</u>.

The crystal spider scuttles across the web to attack Ynyr.
But the old man holds up his clenched fist and shows the
sand running from his fingers.

Stymied, the spider crouches and turns blood red. A scream
of rage fills the cave.

Ynyr reaches the safety of the entrance and looks back: the
blood-red spider scuttles to the center of the web and
smashes open the cubicle. Ynyr looks at his hand: the sand
has run out.

As the old man makes his way sadly down the mountain ...

<u>A SHOT OF THE WIDOW</u>

Shows her encased in a web shroud; and though her body is
old, she retains, even in death, the face of a young girl.

<u>INT. INN</u> - NIGHT

Torquil and his men dandle INN GIRLS on their knees,
laughing, leching, and guzzling. The INNKEEPER bustles
about, assisted by a much-abused serving girl named VEELA,
whose beauty is concealed by kerchiefed hair, frumpy
clothes, and a layer of soot.

Across the room, Colwyn and Ergo sit in front of the fire,
staring gloomily into the flames.

Titch comes in the back door and whispers to Torquil, who
signals his men. They get up and head for the back wall,
where Cyclops is swinging open a pair of large double doors.

Ergo is too glum to notice the sudden diminution of noise,
but Colwyn sees Torquil and his men carrying in a giant
venison pie, ten feet across and five feet high.

                        TITCH
               (comes up to Ergo)
            Ergo?

The little man hunches forward, refusing to answer.

                        TITCH
            Sir Ergo? ... My honorable Lord
            Ergo? ...

                        ERGO
            First, you desert me, and now you
            mock me. Go back to your one-eyed
            friend.

Titch reaches out and presses the end of Ergo's nose.

                        ERGO
            What? Now you poke me in the nose as
            well?

                        TITCH
            I don't think it's working.

                        ERGO
            Not working? This nose? This nose
            works day and night. This nose has
            never loafed an hour in its life.
            This nose ...
               (sniffs)
            What?
               (sniffs again)
            Impossible. This nose asleep while
            venison fills the air?
               (seizes Titch)
            Where is it, boy? Tell me where it
            is and I forgive you everything.

                        TITCH
            It's right behind you.

Ergo turns and his eyes grow as big as the pie.

                        ERGO
               (awed whisper)
            A venison pie as big as a house.

                        CYCLOPS
            A small house.

                        ERGO
            And what do you think a small person
            lives in, you one-eyed fool? Leaving
            me here to mope while you and the
            boy were arranging my assassination.

                        TITCH
            We meant only to please you.

                        ERGO
            And do you think I'm not going to
            eat myself to death this very night?
            Huh?

The dwarf approaches the pie worshipfully.

                        ERGO
            Look at its beauty. Look at its
            grace.

                        TORQUIL
               (holds out a knife)
            Look at its insides.

                        ERGO
            No! Not yet! Let me hug it and kiss
            it a little.  Let me run my fingers
            over its lovely skin.
               (climbs onto the pie)
            Let me climb to the top and sing to
            it.

He clambers up the crust and stands on top of the pie.

                        ERGO
            Henceforth I am Lord Ergo, for now I
            have an estate to rule.

He kneels and embraces the crust.

                        ERGO
               (crooning)
            Let us go then, you and I, my sweet
            and hot and lovely pie ...

The crust suddenly gives way beneath him; he plunges into
the pie, disappearing completely. The onlookers laugh and
applaud. But when he doesn't reappear, they grow worried.

                        TITCH
               (knocks on the crust)
            Ergo? Are you all right?

Ergo's head pops up through the crust.

                        ERGO
            Here lies Lord Ergo, drowned in a
            venison pie. He died with a smile
            and a belch, goodbye, goodbye ...

He disappears inside the pie again. The others crowd around
and begin dismembering it.

<u>INT. INN</u> - LATER THAT NIGHT

Colwyn and the Cyclops stand guard over sleeping robbers and
inn girls. Ergo floats half-awake in the gravy in the pie
shell, a contented smile on his face. He opens his mouth and
allows a piece of venison to float into it. Then he hears
<u>whimpering</u> and peers over the edge of the crust: Titch is
asleep nearby, in the throws of a nightmare.

The serving girl, Vella, is still busy cleaning up. As she
passes the pie shell, she hears <u>scrabbling and splashing</u>,
and stops to see a puppy trying to clamber out.

                        CYCLOPS
            Lift him out.

Vella lifts out the puppy and sets it on the floor. The
puppy shakes itself, then trots over to Titch. The boy hugs
the puppy to his chest.

                        VELLA
               (to Cyclops)
            It's the little man called Ergo,
            isn't it?

                        CYCLOPS
            Yes.

                        VELLA
            He must care a lot for the boy.

                        CYCLOPS
            Yes.

                        INNKEEPER
               (coming over)
            You lazy slut! I don't pay you to
            stand around jawing with the guests!

                        COLWYN
            Leave her be. She's worked hard all
            day.

                        INNKEEPER
            She'll work till dawn if I choose!

He cuffs the girl, knocking her to the floor, but backs away
as Colwyn approaches.

                        COLWYN
               (an order)
            Her working day is over. She'll rest
            now.

The Innkeeper scowls, then skulks off, grumbling. Colwyn
helps the girl up and sees that her ankle has been twisted
by her fall. He puts an arm around her and helps her toward
the stairs.

<u>INT. CENTER OF VORTEX</u>

Lyssa moves around the walkway, looking for escape, but all
the passages leading out of the Center are blocked by red
eyes.

                        VOICE OF THE BEAST
            Have you considered?

She turns to see the gigantic red eyes in the Beast's hole.

                        LYSSA
            I do not want your power. It is
            hideous.

                        VOICE OF THE BEAST
            You know nothing of power, you
            foolish girl. You think power is a
            mighty sword, or a strong castle, or
            the paltry magic of an Emerald Seer.
            Power is none of these.

The red eyes in the hole disappear. Lyssa hears the voice
behind her.

                        VOICE OF THE BEAST
            Power is beauty.

She turns to see a Greek Adonis standing behind her. His
naked body glistens with oil; he is incredibly handsome.
(But his eyes are red.) She retreats. The Adonis vanishes
and Lyssa feels her hand clasped gently. She turns to see a
girl of her own age, smiling at her. (But her eyes are red
and she speaks with the Voice of Darkness.)

                        VOICE OF THE BEAST
            Power is friendship.

When Lyssa pulls her hand away, the girl vanishes.

                        VOICE OF THE BEAST
            Power is joy.

Lyssa sees herself (but with red eyes) as a young mother,
holding a baby and laughing.

Then she feels a hand on her cheek and turns to see Colwyn
(red-eyes), smiling at her as he caresses her cheek. He
speaks with the dark Voice.

                        VOICE OF THE BEAST
            Power is desire.

She knows, from the eyes and voice, that this is not the
real Colwyn. But loneliness and fear and longing are
beginning to take their toll. She touches his hand, presses
it against her cheek.

                        VELLA (OVER)
            The cruelest fate is to be far from
            the one you love, not knowing
            whether you will ever see him again.

<u>INT. VELLA'S ROOM</u> - NIGHT

Vella sits dejectedly on the edge of the bed. Colwyn stands
near.

                        VELLA
            I was betrothed to a boy from my
            village. We were to be married this
            summer, but he traveled across the
            sea and his ship was lost.
               (bows her head, whispers)
            They say he drowned, but I know he
            is alive. I know he will come back
            to me.

Moved by her grief, Colwyn sits on the bed and takes her in
his arms to comfort her.

                        COLWYN
            I know the cruelty of such a fate.

                        VELLA
               (lifts her head)
            Perhaps you think no man would
            return to me.

                        COLWYN
            I don't think that.

Vella stands and slips the kerchief from around her hair,
which is long and lustrous. It tumbles loose, falling
gracefully around her shoulders. She wipes the sleeve across
her face and, almost magically, the smudges and dirt
disappear. She steps out of her ungainly shoes, then
unfastens her ugly dress; it falls to her feet. She stands
barefoot in her chemise, stunningly beautiful.

                        VELLA
            Am I not worth returning to?

                        COLWYN
            Yes.

                        VELLA
            Am I not beautiful enough to be
            loved?

                        COLWYN
            Yes.

                        VELLA
            Even by you?

                        COLWYN
               (drops his eyes)
            Yes.

INT. VORTEX - NIGHT

The red-eyed Colwyn holds Lyssa's hand as he makes his
proposal.

                        VOICE OF THE BEAST
            This I tell you: our children will
            be princes. They will have the power
            of my darkness and the power of your
            blood. They will conquer galaxies.

Lyssa back away, shaking her head no.

                        VOICE OF THE BEAST
            They will make you a queen. A queen
            of worlds uncountable.

The red-eyed Colwyn waves his hand and a stone wall cracks
open.

                        VOICE OF THE BEAST
            These are the galaxies you will
            rule.

Through the crack, we see galaxies moving toward us, slowly
at first, then faster. We see not only the familiar galactic
forms - spirals, ellipses, spheres - but shapes and colors
never seen from Earth: exploding galaxies of red stars,
whirling galaxies of yellow and blue, galaxies writhing as
if in pain. They move toward us, faster and faster, until
they becomes blurs of light and color. Another wall cracks
open.

                        VOICE OF THE BEAST
            These are the worlds of your empire.

We see planets moving toward us: Earthlike planets of blue
and green, volcanic planets spitting flame, gaseous planets,
ringed planets, planets with a hundred moons. Another wall
cracks open.

                        VOICE OF THE BEAST
            These are the beings who will be
            your slaves.

We see crowds of living creatures, some humanoid, others
with shapes never seen, prostrating themselves in obeisance,
keening their pain and fear.

                        LYSSA
            I do not want your worlds or your
            slaves.

                        VOICE OF THE BEAST
            Then look!

Another wall <u>cracks</u> open. We see Colwyn and Vella in a close
embrace.

                        LYSSA
            It's a lie!

                        VOICE OF THE BEAST
            These walls do not lie! He will
            betray you.

                        LYSSA
            He will not!

                        VOICE OF THE BEAST
            Then he will die!

<u>INT. VELLA'S ROOM</u> - INTERCUT

Colwyn and Vella in each other's arms.

                        VELLA
            You too are lonely.

                        COLWYN
            I ache with it.

                        VELLA
            Let me comfort you.

                        COLWYN
            I cannot take comfort when she has
            none.

                        VELLA
            Then give me comfort. Sleep with me
            tonight.

                        COLWYN
            I cannot betray my bride.

                        VELLA
            One night is no betrayal. Have pity
            on me.
               (begins to cry)
            Please, I beg you, do not refuse me.
            You do not know the price.

Her tears wash the <u>blue dye</u> from her eyes and we see that
her eyes are <u>red</u>.

Colwyn is in the arms of a Dark One.

                        COLWYN
            I feel your pain, but I cannot
            betray her.

                        VELLA
            You will not, then?

                        COLWYN
            I cannot.

Vella's left hand <u>turns into a claw</u>. She moves it toward his
neck, then stops. She begins to cry; <u>blood-red tears</u> run
down her cheeks.

                        VELLA
            My master told me: make him betray
            her; if he will not, kill him.

Colwyn steps back from her.

                        VELLA
               (thrusts out her claw)
            Yes, <u>he</u> is my master.

Colwyn plucks his glaive from his belt and poises it to
throw.

                        VELLA
            These talons were a heartbeat from
            your throat. I could have killed you
            in an instant.

Colwyn lowers the glaive.

                        VELLA
            But in the hour I knew you, I loved
            you. That love is life for you and
            death for me. Remember me.

In the Vortex, Lyssa stares defiantly at the red-eyed
Colwyn.

                        LYSSA
            It is you who are betrayed.

The red-eyed Colwyn extends his left hand, which turns into
a claw; the talons clutch the empty air - and in her room,
Vella gasps as she is strangled.

The red-eyed Colwyn snaps his arm sideways - and Vella is
flung across her room against the wall. Her body
disintegrates, leaving only gray ash and an empty chemise.

                        COLWYN
            Have faith, Lyssa. I will come.

In the Vortex, the false Colwyn has vanished. The huge red
eyes have reappeared in the Beast's hole.

                        LYSSA
            He will come for me.

                        VOICE OF THE BEAST (OVER)
            He will not come. You will be my
            queen.

The eyes recede, accompanied by the heavy, slithering sound.

<u>EXT. VALLEY OF REEDS</u> - SUNRISE

As the twin suns edge above the horizon, the black, hulking
Fortress of Krull rises majestically above the reeds.

<u>EXT. INN</u> - DAWN

Ynyr, having just returned from the mountain, confers with
the band outside the inn.

                        YNYR
            We must reach the Valley of Reeds
            before the next dawn.

                        TORQUIL
            It's a hundred leagues from here.

                        COLWYN
            We could reach it on fire-mares.

                        TORQUIL
            Those beasts cannot be saddled by
            mortal men.

                        CYCLOPS
            They can be saddled.

                        COLWYN
            You have done it?

                        CYCLOPS
            I road them often in my youth.

                        COLWYN
               (to Torquil)
            Saddles.

                        TORQUIL
            The innkeeper.

As Colwyn and Torquil move toward the inn, Ynyr draws the
Cyclops aside, glancing at the <u>bands of white linen</u> on his
wrists.

                        YNYR
               (low, to Cyclops)
            It is dangerous for you.

                        CYCLOPS
            It will only be a few hours. Then I
            will accept my fate.

<u>EXT. MARSH</u> - DAY

The band watches from the edge of the marsh as the Cyclops
stands knee-deep in water, facing the charge of a dozen
fire-mares.

                        ERGO
            They'll trample him to death!

                        YNYR
            No. He will master the leader.

The fire-mares charge past the Cyclops, who disappears in a
cloud of smoke and steam and spray. They wheel and charge
again, circling him. He fixes his eyes on the lead mare, who
pulls out of the circle and comes toward him. The Cyclops
places his hand on the mare's muzzle and the horse stands
quietly. The others follow suit, forming a circle around
him.

<u>EXT. MARSH</u> - A FEW MINUTES LATER

The band is mounted, except for the Cyclops. Titch sits
behind Colwyn.

                        ERGO
               (calls)
            Quell?

                        CYCLOPS
            I cannot go with you, my friend.

                        COLWYN
            It is today?

                        CYCLOPS
            Yes. It is today.

The band files past him, each man reaching down to shake his
hand. Ergo is next to last. His mouth works as he tries to
speak, but no words come out. The Cyclops embraces him.

                        ERGO
            My heart stays here.

                        CYCLOPS
            And mine goes with you.

Ergo moves off, wiping his nose on his sleeve. Colwyn is
last, with Titch sitting behind him.

                        COLWYN
               (to Titch)
            You're too young to come with us,
            lad. Stay with our friend.

He swings the boy to the ground, then grips the Cyclops's
hand.

                        COLWYN
            Each to his fate.

                        CYCLOPS
            Each to his fate.

The Cyclops stands beside Titch, holding the boy's hand,
watching the band move off.

                        YNYR
               (to Colwyn, as they ride)
            He ran a great risk, helping us
            today. If he opposes his fate, his
            death will be terribly painful.

                        COLWYN
               (looking back)
            Let us wish him peace.

The Cyclops is sitting cross-legged on the ground, having
wound a <u>white linen headband</u> around his forehead. Titch sits
beside him.

                        TORQUIL
               (pointing up)
            We must cover a hundred leagues
            before sunrise.

                        COLWYN
               (stand in his stirrups)
            At the gallop!

As the mares increase their speed, their sparking hooves
begin to flash, until, at full gallop, their feet and
fetlocks are enveloped in flame. They thunder down the road
on a carpet of fire.

<u>EXT. RIDGE</u> - SUNSET

In long shot, we see the fire-mares silhouetted against the
darkening sky, galloping along the spine of the ridge on a
thin line of flame.

<u>EXT. FORD</u> - NIGHT

A GATEKEEPER comes out of his hut as he hears approaching
hoof-beats. A wooden gate stretches across the road, barring
the ford.

                        GATEKEEPER
               (to himself)
            If they're nobles, it'll cost 'em
            gold.

The Gatekeeper's mouth drops as the fire-mares round the
curve and <u>smash</u> through the gate, causing the stream to boil
and hiss as they gallop through it. He stares at the clouds
of steam that mark their passage.

                        GATEKEEPER
               (plaintive whine)
            I would've settled for silver.

<u>EXT. LOG ROAD IN SWAMP</u> - NIGHT

With hoofbeats audible in the distance, half a dozen THIEVES
huddle on the log road, preparing an ambush.

                        LEADER
            To your places. If they resist, show
            no mercy!

The thieves kneel at the edge of the log road, weapons at
the ready. The Leader stands in the middle of the road,
notches an arrow, and draws his bow.

                        LEADER
            Hold, or you are dead men!

His eyes turn to saucers as the fire-mares round the curve
and bear down on him. He yelps and dives into the swamp,
along with the rest of his band. The fire-mares thunder
past, leaving the thieves gulping swamp-water and <u>the log</u>
<u>road in flames</u>.

<u>EXT. VALLEY OF REEDS</u> - JUST BEFORE DAWN

The horizon shows light gray as the fire-mares streak across
the valley, leaving a trail of blazing reeds.

Two dozen Slayers ride from the Fortress to oppose them.

                        COLWYN
               (shouts to Torquil)
            It's almost dawn! Flank them!

Torquil leads half the band to the right, Colwyn leads the
other half to the left. They sweep past the Slayers on
either side, surrounding them with a <u>ring of fire</u>. The
Slayers are enveloped by flames as the band reconverges and
heads toward the high wall of the Fortress.

But a dismounted Slayer pierces the fiery wall, his clothes
flaming, and hurls a spear at Rhun at the tail of the band.
Colwyn and Torquil look back and see Rhun skewered by the
spear, the point protruding from his chest. Torquil shakes
his head and they continue toward the wall.

But atop the wall, hidden behind the crenellated parapet,
wait another dozen Slayers with <u>cauldrons of boiling pitch</u>
at the ready.

Colwyn reaches the bottom of the wall and swings off his
mare.

                        COLWYN
            Up the wall! Quickly!

The others dismount and follow him up the wall, which is
canted back some twenty degrees from the vertical, allowing
them to clamber up the stone courses. But suddenly a stream
of boiling pitch pours down the wall toward them.

                        TORQUIL
            Look out!

They dodge the hissing steam of pitch, but a second stream
catches Oswin, who screams as he's enveloped by the boiling
liquid.

Colwyn and Torquil look up to see a cauldron of pitch being
moved into position directly above them. But Torquil points
down the wall where ...

... the Cyclops is galloping along the parapet, the hooves
of his fire-mare sparking against the stone. Titch stands on
the saddle behind him, with a crossbow laid across his broad
shoulder. The boy looses a bolt and hits one of the Slayers
at the cauldron, saving Colwyn and Torquil.

The Slayers loose a hail of arrows, several of which strike
the Cyclops in the chest. But he keeps coming, and Titch
keeps firing bolts from behind his shoulder, felling Slayers
like deer.

As the twin suns are about to rise, the Slayers overturn the
great cauldron of pitch, which pours down the wall, heading
straight for Colwyn ...

<u>EXT. ARCTIC LANDSCAPE</u> - SUNRISE

The Fortress rises out of the ice and Colwyn looks up to see
the stream of pitch frozen solid, not three feet above them.

                        COLWYN
               (shouts)
            On them!

He leads the band up the wall to the parapet, where the
Cyclops has dismounted and is holding off several Slayers,
shielding Titch, who is still firing his deadly bolts. A
brief but fierce battle disposes of the Slayers.

The band gathers around the fallen Cyclops. A dozen broken-
off arrow shafts protrude from his body. He holds Ergo's
small hand in one of his great paws.

                        CYCLOPS
               (dying smile)
            A man can ask nothing more than that
            his death help his friends.

His hand tightens with the pain that he has brought upon
himself, then his fingers open slowly. Ergo stifles a sob as
the great eye closes in death.

Torquil calls Colwyn's attention to yet another group of
Slayers in the distance. Colwyn leads the band across an ice
bridge to a stone door encased in ice. They hack through the
ice and swing open the door, which opens onto a set of stone
stairs leading down.

                        TORQUIL
               (glance toward Slayers)
            I'll stay behind and keep them busy.

                        YNYR
            It is not necessary. They will not
            follow.

<u>INT. STONE STAIRWAY</u> - INTERCUT - DAY

The band moves down the stairs.

Above, the Slayers reach the stone door, but they're clearly
reluctant to descend. One steps forward and starts down -
but then hears the eerie <u>screams</u> of the Dark Ones below. He
scurries back up and, with the others, backs away from the
door.

On the stairs below, the eerie screams are deafening,
echoing through the stone corridors. Ynyr leads the band,
taking them down the stairs, across a landing, and down
another flight of stairs.

Torquil notices mortar crumbling between the stones of the
staircase.

                        TORQUIL
            Look.

                        YNYR
            Yes, they are weakening. It takes
            great power to maintain the
            Fortress, and they have expended
            much.

<u>INT. STONE CORRIDOR</u>

The band hurries down the corridor, pursued by dozens of red
eyes.

                        TORQUIL
               (looking back)
            They're gaining on us.
               (draws his sword)
            We must slow them up with steel.

They are standing beneath a Romanesque arch that supports
the wall.

                        COLWYN
               (looks up at the arch)
            Better stone than steel.

He draws his sword and inserts it beside the capstone of the
arch, working the blade to loosen the mortar. Torquil
follows his thought and begins chopping at the mortar on the
other side of the capstone.

The red eyes are almost on them when they finally succeed in
dislodging the capstone. They jump back as the capstone
falls and the arch collapses, blocking the corridor with a
wall of stone rubble.

                        TORQUIL
            You're resourceful, my lad.
               (grins)
            I tell you, one year under my
            tutelage and I could make you the
            Prince of Thieves.

                        COLWYN
            Subject to the King, no doubt.

                        TORQUIL
               (modest bow)
            Naturally.

Suddenly, <u>a black claw bursts from the stone rubble</u> and
clutches Torquil by the neck. Colwyn quickly draws his sword
and hacks off the arm, which disintegrates into gray ash.

                        TORQUIL
               (fingering his neck)
            A good thrust, my friend. Another
            second and there'd have been nothing
            between my head and shoulders but
            bad memories.

                        COLWYN
            I intend to keep you alive, your
            majesty. So you can abdicate your
            throne and become my Warlord.

                        TORQUIL
            Perhaps. If the pay is good.

Colwyn signals Ynyr, who leads the group down the corridor
and then down yet another flight of stone stairs. They
emerge in ...

<u>INT. CAVERN OF AGE</u>

A pillared cave, pitch black. We hear the rasping sound of
labored breathing, as of old men close to death.

                        COLWYN
               (calls softly)
            Stay together.

They move through the cave, weapons at the ready. A feeble
voice calls out.

                        OLD TORQUIL
            Torquil ...

Torquil turns to see a wizened, hollow-eyed old man: himself
at the end of his life.

                        OLD TORQUIL
            Do not let this happen, Torquil.

A PRIESTESS OF YOUTH steps out from behind a pillar: she is
eighteen, wearing a transparent garment that shows the
stunning beauty of her young body. She holds a golden goblet
containing a rainbow-colored liquid.

                        PRIESTESS
            It need not happen, Torquil. Drink
            the rainbow. It is youth.

She reaches behind the pillar and takes the hand of YOUNG
TORQUIL, pulling him into view: it is Torquil as he was at
eighteen.

                        PRIESTESS
            It is <u>your</u> youth, Torquil.

                        YNYR
               (touches Torquil)
            This is the Cavern of Age. Touch
            nothing, take nothing, or the future
            will be plunged into your heart.

Torquil shudders as he looks at the old man he will become,
horrified by the gaping face of his own future. Colwyn takes
his arm and gently pulls him away. But the Priestess of
Youth slips ahead, appearing again with the Young Torquil,
this time in passionate embrace. As she caresses the youth,
she holds out the goblet to Torquil.

                        PRIESTESS
            Drink the rainbow, Torquil. Youth is
            yours. I am yours. Take me, Torquil.

                        COLWYN
               (guiding him past)
            She lies, my friend.

Now it is Ergo's turn to confront the future. He sees
himself as an old man, bald and shrunken, at the edge of
death.

                        OLD ERGO
            Ergo, save yourself. Save yourself
            from this.

>From behind a pillar appears a FAIRY PRIESTESS OF YOUTH,
golden-haired, beautiful, holding a gold goblet. She tilts
the goblet and pours some of the rainbow liquid into her
hand.

                        FAIRY PRIESTESS
               (holds out her cupped hand)
            Drink from my hand, Ergo. I can save
            you.

Ergo starts toward her, but Titch grabs his arm.

                        TITCH
               (yanking him back)
            Ergo!

Ergo allows himself to be pulled along, gazing back
wistfully.

                        ERGO
            Oh, she was so beautiful - and I was
            so <u>ugly</u>.

                        TITCH
            Would you desert your friends?

                        ERGO
               (shaking himself out of it)
            No, no. I'm with you, boy.

Bringing up the rear of the group is Kegan. He looks to the
side and gasps in horror as he sees himself at age eighty,
writhing on the floor, wracked by the pain of a horrible
last illness.

                        OLD KEGAN
               (gasping)
            Disease and pain, Kegan. This is
            your future.

A PRIESTESS OF YOUTH appears. She is very young, perhaps
fifteen, with the kind of beauty that makes a man catch his
breath. She holds out the goblet, her face full of
compassion and concern.

                        VERY YOUNG PRIESTESS
               (pleading with him)
            Oh please, Kegan, don't let this
            happen. Come to me as you were.

A YOUNG KEGAN steps out beside her. He is sixteen, a golden
youth.

                        VERY YOUNG PRIESTESS
            Come to me young, Kegan.

She steps forward, moving very close to him.

                        VERY YOUNG PRIESTESS
               (whispers)
            Your youth is in the goblet, come to
            me in the rainbow.

No mortal man could resist her. She holds the goblet to his
lips and he drinks.

                        TORQUIL
               (sees him and shouts)
            Kegan!

                        YNYR
            It is too late. He has drunk.

The Priestess embraces Kegan. As they kiss, a rainbow arches
down and envelopes them in its multi-colored light. But the
colors soon fade and the rainbow becomes an arc of white
light, growing brighter and more intense. In the blinding
light, the Priestess begins to age, turning old before our
eyes, as does Kegan himself.

The others watch, frozen in horror, as Kegan struggles to
escape her embrace. But she clutches him with bony fingers,
pressing her wrinkled mouth to his. They topple to the
floor, writhing in each other's arms, their skin turning to
parchment. The writhing stops. Two skeletons lie on the
floor, locked in fatal embrace, the white bones shimmering
in the arc of light.

As the others continue through the cave, Ergo takes Titch's
hand and places it on his arm.

                        ERGO
            Keep a tight hold, boy, in case I
            get any more crazy ideas.

<u>INT. OUTER WALL OF VORTEX</u>

The band approaches the curving bloodstone wall of the
Vortex. Great circular openings in the wall indicate the
terminal of the Arms.

                        YNYR
               (to Colwyn)
            They will hold Lyssa in the Center
            of the Vortex, the place of the
            Beast, where its power is greatest.
            No man can match it there. Lyssa
            must try to move toward us. For as
            we enter the Vortex and move closer
            ...

                        COLWYN
               (waits, then finishes the
                sentence)
            The Beast will kill her.

                        YNYR
            Yes. To keep her from you. But now
            that we are inside the Fortress, you
            will be able to contact her.

Colwyn kneels on the floor, elbow on knee, bending his
forehead against his hand in concentration.

                        COLWYN (OVER)
            Lyssa ...

<u>INT. CENTER OF VORTEX</u> - INTERCUT

Lyssa is halfway up the spiraled wall of the Vortex, midway
between the Beast's hole below and the passage above - all
of which are guarded by red eyes.

                        LYSSA (OVER)
            Colwyn ...

                        COLWYN (OVER)
            You must move away from the Center.

                        LYSSA (OVER)
            All the passages are guarded.

                        YNYR
               (hand on Colwyn's shoulder)
            She must make a glaive.

                        COLWYN (OVER)
            Lyssa, your bracelets. Bend them
            straight and cross them.

Lyssa removes a pair of gold bracelets from her arm, bends
them straight, and forms a cross.

                       COLWYN (OVER)
            Now grip them in your hand.

She wraps her fingers around the intersection of the cross,
converting the bracelets into a kind of homemade glaive.

                        COLWYN (OVER)
            Will your power outward.

                        LYSSA (OVER)
            I don't know how.

                        COLWYN (OVER)
            You have the power. <u>Will it</u>.

As Lyssa frowns in concentration, her glaive <u>begins to glow</u>.

                        LYSSA (OVER)
            Yes. I can do it.

                        YNYR
               (to Colwyn)
            West.

                        COLWYN (OVER)
            Take the western passage.

                        LYSSA (OVER)
            All directions are the same here.

                        YNYR
               (to Colwyn)
            The spiral begins in the west.

                        COLWYN (OVER)
            Where the spiral begins.

Lyssa looks up to where the spiral begins.

                        LYSSA (OVER)
            Yes.

                        COLWYN (OVER)
            Move quickly. We are coming for you.
            We are in the Fortress.

                        LYSSA (OVER)
               (as she smiles)
            I knew you would come.

At the outer wall, the band is midway between two of the
Arms. Ynyr looks from one to the other, then chooses <u>the one</u>
<u>on the left</u>.

And in the Center, Lyssa must make a similar choice, for the
spiral begins midway between two of the Arms. She also
chooses <u>the one on the left</u>. She holds the shining glaive in
front of her as she moves into the Arm and we hear the
scrape of talons and the gutturals of frustration as the red
eyes are forced to retreat before it.

<u>INT. FIRST ARM OF VORTEX</u>

The band moves down the curving Arm, toward the Center.

<u>INT. SECOND ARM OF VORTEX</u>

Lyssa moves out the adjacent Arm, away from the Center. She
holds her glaive in front of her, forcing back the red eyes.

<u>INT. CENTER OF VORTEX</u>

The huge red eyes of the Beast rise toward the top of its
hole. We hear a hideous scream of rage as the Beast
discovers Lyssa gone.

We do not actually see it emerge from its hole, but we see
the reaction of the lesser Dark Ones guarding the passages:
they shrink in fear, fleeing up the passages as the Beast
climbs out of its hole and up the side of the spiral funnel.

As the Beast moves into the west passage, we catch a glimpse
of one taloned foot: it is so large that the mind can't
conceive of a living creature this huge. It leaves behind a
trail of black mud mixed with fragments of a bizarre
seaweed: dark red, with spiral leaves.

<u>INT. SECOND ARM OF VORTEX</u>

Lyssa glances back fearfully as she hears the Beast coming
up the Arm.

                        LYSSA
            Colwyn. Where are you, Colwyn?

<u>INT. FIRST ARM OF VORTEX</u>

Ynyr leads the band down the Arm.

                        YNYR
               (worried)
            We should have reached her by now.

Colwyn stops, furrows his brow in concentration.

                        COLWYN (OVER)
            Lyssa ...

                        LYSSA (OVER)
               (breathing hard)
            Come quickly, Colwyn. I can see the
            eyes of the Beast.

Colwyn turns toward the right-hand wall of the passage.

                        COLWYN (OVER)
            Lyssa, touch the wall of your
            passage.

Lyssa presses her hand against the wall behind her.

                        COLWYN
               (runs to the wall)
            She's on the other side of this
            wall. I can feel it!

                        YNYR
               (covers his eyes)
            I chose the wrong passage.

                        COLWYN
            She can see the Beast!

                        YNYR
            Use your sword.

                        COLWYN
            What use is my sword? I can't reach
            her!

                        YNYR
               (points to wall)
            Cut. <u>Cut</u>!

Colwyn stares at him for a moment, then unsheathes his
sword, grips it with both hands, and swings it at the stone
wall. The blade strikes the stone with a spine-shivering
<u>clang</u>. He swings again - another clang. But on his third
swing, the blade bites into the rock, sinking to a depth of
several inches.

On the next swing, the blade penetrates deep into the rock,
and on the next, it slices all the way through, tearing
loose chunks of stone. Colwyn swings the sword back and
forth like a scythe, cutting his way through the solid rock,
spraying fragments behind him.

In the other passage, Lyssa presses herself against the
wall, watching the Beast's eyes come closer. Suddenly, a
chuck of rock bursts out of the wall near her as Colwyn cuts
through. He seizes her arm and pulls her through the hole,
into the adjacent passage.

Ynyr lays a hand on Colwyn's shoulder as he embraces Lyssa.

                        YNYR
            You must move quickly. The Beast
            will stop at nothing now.

                        COLWYN
               (divines his intention)
            You're coming with us.

                        YNYR
               (shakes his head no)
            It is my fate to die in the
            Fortress.

                        COLWYN
            No! You cannot know that!

                        YNYR
            I can. Because I choose it.

                        COLWYN
               (imperious)
            I forbid you!

Ynyr smiles indulgently. Colwyn shrugs in embarrassment.

                        COLWYN
            I didn't mean it that way. But you
            cannot stay.

Ynyr takes Colwyn and Lyssa by the arm and moves up the
passage.

                        YNYR
            <u>You</u> cannot stay. You must both
            escape the Fortress or else this
            world is doomed.

<u>INT. OTHER ARM OF VORTEX</u>

The Beast moves toward the hole in the passage wall.

<u>RESUME - COLWYN ET. AL.</u>

They hear the Beast tearing at the stone wall, enlarging the
hole to allow it to pass through. Ynyr nudges Colwyn and
Lyssa up the passage.

                        YNYR
            Go now.
               (turns to Torquil)
            Quell was wise. He knew that a man
            cannot ask more of his death than it
            help his friends.

                        TORQUIL
               (sadly, grips his hand)
            That is true.

The wet-eyed Ergo is too choked with emotion to approach the
old man. Ynyr lays a hand on Titch's head.

                        YNYR
               (smiles)
            Take care of Ergo.

                        TITCH
            Yes, sir.

The five move up the passage.

                        COLWYN
            Quickly, or he will waste his life
            for nothing.

They increase their pace. Ynyr watches them until they
disappear, then backs slowly up the passage.

A section of wall <u>explodes</u> inward as the Beast tears his way
through. Ynyr sees the red eyes and places a hand on his
glaive.

                        YNYR
            You and I were destined to meet, my
            friend.

He flings his glaive, which flies to a point ten feet in
front of him and hangs in midair, glowing.

                        YNYR
            And I am not so old that I can be
            swatted like a fly.

He thrusts his hand forward - the glaive leaps toward the
Beast, giving off a blinding light. The Beast roars and
retreats.

                        YNYR
            No, not so old as that, my black
            beauty.

Now the red eyes narrow as the Beast focuses its power on
the glaive. The weapon is pushed backwards, slowly but
surely.

                        YNYR
            Yes, you will have to attack me
            directly to kill me. I will cost you
            power, my dark friend. Much power.

He thrusts his hand out and the glaive leaps forward - but
only a few feet this time. The Beast's power stops it, then
continues to push it back toward the old man. He holds out
his clenched fist and stops the glaive about five feet in
front of him. The Beast's power is so tremendous, however,
that the arms of the weapon begin bending backward.

Suddenly, one of the horizontal arms snaps off and flies
toward Ynyr, grazing his shoulder. He staggers back, but
manages to hold the glaive steady. The other horizontal arm
snaps off and buries itself in his chest. He goes down on
one knee but continues to hold the glaive steady, though the
weapon is now reduced to its vertical axis.

Finally, his strength gives out. He drops his arm. The
vertical blade spins toward him and pierces his throat. The
beast moves past his crumpled body, up the passage.

<u>INT. VERY WIDE STAIRCASE</u>

The five make their way up the staircase to a landing. As
Torquil starts up the next flight, Colwyn calls him back.

                        COLWYN
            We must find a smaller passage,
            where it cannot follow.

They move down a corridor to ...

<u>INT. DODECAHEDRON</u>

They look around in confusion at the doors in each of the
twelve sides of the huge room.

                        TORQUIL
            Which one?

                        LYSSA
            Where is the Fortress?

                        COLWYN
            In the Arctic ice.

                        LYSSA
               (points to door)
            That way. I can feel the cold.

They move to the door, which opens onto a long stairway
leading up. At the top, we can see snow blowing past the
opening.

                        COLWYN
               (pointing up)
            She's right. Look.

They hear the Beast coming closer and start up the long
stairway.

<u>INT. LONG STAIRWAY</u> - NIGHT

As the five make their way upward, a terrible noise from
below makes them stop and look back: the Beast is tearing
away the rock, enlarging the passage to follow them. They
quicken their pace.

Along the stairs are small piles of fine powder: the mortar
between the stones is crumbling and trickling down the
walls.

<u>EXT. FORTRESS</u> - NIGHT

The five emerge from the staircase and make their way across
the Arctic landscape, toward the outer wall. Colwyn looks
back and sees the Beast tearing its way out of the Fortress.

                        COLWYN
            Make for the wall. I'll catch up.

                        TORQUIL
            Colwyn, don't be a fool. You can't
            do battle with that thing.

                        COLWYN
            There's no way to outrun it. You
            know that. This is what Ynyr was
            preparing me for. It's what he died
            for.

                        LYSSA
            You'll be killed.

                        TORQUIL
            Don't worry. I'll tap him on the
            head with my sword hilt if I have
            to.

                        COLWYN
               (quietly, but with iron
                authority)
            You'll lead the others to the wall
            as I tell you. <u>Now</u>.

Torquil bows to Colwyn's authority; he leads the others
toward the wall. Colwyn pulls off his hauberk, useless in
this battle, and faces the Beast in his tunic. The wind
whips the thin cloth as he advances across the ice to where
the Beast waits, obscured by the thickly falling snow.

Suddenly, a gigantic chunk of ice flies straight at him. He
raises his hand and the ice shatters, streaking past him
harmlessly.

Now he begins to concentrate, focusing his power until his
body gleams - then shimmers - then bursts into flame with
tongues of white fire leaping from his body as if it had
been doused in gasoline. The flame is under his power; it
doesn't harm him, nor does it melt the snow he walks on. It
only harms when he wills it - as when he sees a patch of
Dark Ones approaching from the side. He sweeps his arm
toward them and an arc of flames rolls across the ice like a
wave, washing over them and leaving their charred bodies
writhing in the snow.

The Beast is moving back and forth in an area of ice ridges
and hummocks, dimly visible through the heavy snowfall. Near
it is a stone tower, some fifty feet high. The tower is
suddenly lifted from the ground and hurled at Colwyn. He
makes a downward chop with his hand and the tower splits in
the middle, the two pieces flying past on either side of
him.

                        COLWYN
            I am no feeble old man for you to
            crush with two blows.
               (moves forward, grim-faced)
            This is for that old man.

He sweeps his arm toward the Beast and an arc of flame rolls
across the ice. As the Beast sidesteps, the flaming arc
slices off the top of an ice hummock, leaving the flat
surface boiling and steaming from the heat.

Colwyn presses forward, driven by grief and rage. He
launches a second arc of flame, one end of which catches the
Beast's side. The Beast roars with pain and retreats, driven
back by Colwyn's power. He launches a third arc, and this
one strikes the Beast's head, staggering it.

The Beast is wounded now: one of its huge eyes is swollen
half shut, the skin around it badly charred. Enraged, the
Beast counterattacks. Huge projectiles streak toward Colwyn:
first come blocks of ice, then great fragments of stone.
Finally, the stone fragments begin to burn, screaming
through the air like meteors.

The projectiles shatter against Colwyn's protective shield
of flame, but the force of repeated impact drives him
backward. Small fragments of ice and stone actually pierce
the shield, tearing his tunic, cutting his skin. He is
bleeding from several flesh wounds and his forehead is
burned by a fragment of flaming rock.

But the Beast's power is not infinite. The hail of
projectiles slows, then stops. Colwyn resumes his advance.
He chops his arm downward: we hear a sharp crack and an ice
hummock EXPLODES near the Beast. He chops again and an ice
ridge EXPLODES, leaving a deep crack in the ice. The Beast
hurls another projectile, but Colwyn brushes it aside as if
it were a mosquito and sweeps an arc of flame at the Beast
to back it off.

Then he resumes chopping with his arm: <u>crack</u> followed
closely on <u>crack</u> as the ice around the Beast is sliced and
shattered by Colwyn's power. The section of ice on which the
Beast stands suddenly <u>drops</u> a foot or so. The Beast hurls a
final projectile, then Colwyn cracks the ice again. We hear
a deep RUMBLE and a huge section of ice collapses, falling
into the depths of the Fortress, carrying the Beast with it.

Watching from a distance, Torquil sees the exhausted Colwyn
staggering on the ice, barely able to stand.

                        TORQUIL
               (to the others)
            I'll get him. Make for the wall.

Torquil heads for Colwyn. Ergo pushes Lyssa and Titch toward
the wall.

                        ERGO
            Quickly, quickly to the wall.

But Ergo himself turns around and follows Torquil to where
Colwyn is stumbling on the ice. Dark Ones flit between the
ice hummocks, converging on them.

As Torquil helps Colwyn toward the wall, Ergo forms a rear
guard, armed with butcher knives from his voluminous coat.
As Dark Ones lunge out of the swirling snow, the little man
faces them fearlessly, hurling his knives with deadly aim to
protect his friends: one creature falls with a knife between
the eyes, another with a knife in the neck, a third pierced
through the heart.

They reach the parapet, where Torquil and Lyssa help Colwyn
over the wall. The five clamber down the face of the wall
and Torquil is about to jump off onto the icy ground.

                        COLWYN
               (points to horizon)
            Wait!

The two suns are about to come up. They remain on the wall -
except for Ergo, who slips on a sheet of ice and slides
toward the ground. Titch reaches out and grabs his hand,
holding him on the wall, though Ergo's legs are buried in
snow up to the knees.

<u>EXT. FOREST VALLEY</u> - SUNRISE

Clinging to the wall, the five look out on a green valley.
Ergo's legs are still buried to the knees, <u>but in the</u>
<u>ground</u>. The stones of the wall are shifting. The Fortress is
collapsing.

                        COLWYN
               (jumps to the ground)
            Away from the wall!

Torquil and Colwyn haul Ergo out of the ground and move away
from the wall.

They watch the Fortress crumble.

                        COLWYN
            It's a fitting monument for Ynyr and
            Quell and the others.

The Fortress sinks from sight, leaving a green valley in its
place.

                        LYSSA
            That's a better one.

                        COLWYN
            Yes.

They make their way across the glen, Colwyn and Lyssa with
arms around each other, Titch riding on Torquil's shoulder,
and the Ergo-puppy riding on Titch's.

                        LYSSA
               (looks around)
            Where's Ergo?

Titch hands her the Ergo-puppy, who licks her face. She
laughs and sets the puppy down. It runs in front of them,
frisking.

PEASANT FAMILIES come out of the forest and join them.
Children chase the puppy through the grass.

FADE OUT.

                           <u>THE END</u>
